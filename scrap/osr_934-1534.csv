"As of now, no Twitter (""X"") links are allowed on /r/osr.","Hi folks,

Not that there ever were a lot, but as of now, any Twitter (""X"") links are banned here on /r/osr. This counts both for posts and comments. I said originally not to call anyone a Nazi unless they literally had Swastika tattoos, but doing a Nazi salute, twice, in public, then trying to convince people to doubt the evidence of their own senses, is at least the equivalent of that.

This is not censorship. This is editorial control. If you want to create your own subreddit, maybe /r/gaslighting (does that already exist?) or /r/nazisarentreallynazis, you are free to do so, and I won't/can't stand in your way.

If you complain that /r/osr has gone ""woke"", or ever use that term in a non-ironic way, I feel sorry for you. It must be exhausting trying to find immigrants, or people with different skin tones, or folks with alternate sexual identities, to blame the consequences of your own poor life decisions on. And trying to defend it as a ""Roman salute"" or whatnot is just sad.

Penalty for posting a Twitter/X link is an instant ban. We'll have to think about for how long, but I'm thinking at least a week. Penalty for trying to subvert by posting an image of such a post or some other circuitous trick will result in a permanent ban.

regards,

the /r/osr mod team, and me, /u/amp108, personally.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122fbeb70>,osr,1737564380.0
Found my dad's old dnd stuff,"Post was deleted in the main dnd sub, so I'm posting here as I was told you guys may like it :)

Hey all, first post in this sub. So recently I got into dnd and spoke with my dad about running a campaign. He was telling me about the old days and how he thinks all his dnd stuff is kicking around somewhere. After a bit rummaging, we found it. I think it's so cool looking back at all of this old stuff and comparing what it was like to play back then to 5e. This is now my most prized possession and I shall cherish it forever. What a cool thing. Oh, and we definitely plan on running a campaign with this.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x12307f860>,osr,1731460084.0

Dark Sun OSE Revamped,"
Greetings everybody! 
I am hereby to share my revamped versions of the Dark Sun OSE conversion that I shared a while back. With these new revisions, I went through all the books and reorganized them in 2, the Player's Handbook and Game Master's Guide, making some clear revisions:
 
1- I added new covers, made by the awesome gentleman Alexandre Henriques, with the important disclaimers that these booklets are only for free distribution and not official in any kind (They are and shall always be free)

2- Made some corrections for typos and other formatting issues that I wasn't able to notice initially.

3- The books are now in A5 format, rather than A4, meaning that this conversion now is set into the OSE format.

4- Minimum additions for the player's handbook, as it includes both the genre rules and psionic and magic booklets combined into one!

5- Major additions for the Game Master's Guide, I included 27 New Magical Items from the Dark Sun setting (Adding to a total of 30) and a Wilderness Feature Generator. Now you can randomly generate natural formations from different categories and combinations, from vegetation, hydrography, relief and many more,  randomly rolled depending on the region of the wilderness you find yourself in.

Once again, thank you for all the support, these additions have made these project all the more exciting personally, and I hope you can use them at your table!

"Alexander Macris, the creator of Adventurer Conqueror King, is an active figure in the American alt-right movement. There are enough good B/X clones that one could buy without financially supporting the promotion of a hateful ideology.","I would have made this a reply to his kickstarter post but he has pre-emptively blocked users that were critical of him on this subreddit in order to keep the post as sycophantic as possible.

There's been an organized effort coordinated from the official Autarch discord server to jump on any comments in /r/osr that point this out, as well as to signal boost ACKS 2E prior to the kickstarter launch. The kickstarter post now on the front page was surely also shared there with the intent to generate early, non-endemic momentum. This behaviour is in violation of reddit's site-wide rules and in my opinion would warrant banning any and all Autarch/Arbiter of Worlds content from being promoted on this subreddit, a response many other subreddits have found effective against persistent brigading. This would have the added benefit of reducing the amount of transphobia and antisemitism on /r/osr, as those sentiments seem to inevitably pop up in comment chains about ACKS despite fans' insistence that the game has nothing to do with the politics of its creator.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1235dfe60>,osr,1698172836.0
Playing Dungeon Crawl Classics with my daughters.,"To be real I've read DCC, even watched some videos but never really sat down to play a game through the first one shot. Asked my girls if they were up for a game, and they said sure!

Got to rolling some characters, 3d6 DTL. Got a human fighter, human cleric of Cthulhu, and a halfling. 

Did a one shot where the temple that the cleric worshipped at was raided by pirate orcs stealing an important artifact. Got the other two mixed in to join by being the hired help to accompany the Cleric.

Approaching the hide out by following the coast line. The hideout located on a cliff face was guarded by a lone orc.

Waiting till nightfall they saw the orcs leave on their ship, and approached it under cover of darkness. They decided to return back to a village they passed up a ways that was also suffering from the orcs.

We stopped there for now but hoping to continue again today or next week. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x12356a720>,osr,1734025060.0
"Announcement: starting now, there will be a ban on promoting any Zak S content.","Folks,

The circumstances which led me to ban Zak Smith/Zak Sabbath/Zak S from this subreddit now impel me to enact a ban on mentioning his works. I had (perhaps naïvely) believed that a user ban would be enough, but it seems like he has enough sock puppet accounts or minions to keep his presence alive here, especially as he continues to produce new content. Therefore, posts promoting him or his products will be removed; repeat posters will be banned. Comments mentioning him will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but may be removed and might also result in a user ban.

To be clear: I do not know for a fact that the allegations of abuse against him are true, but they come from multiple sources, and to my knowledge not all of them have been refuted (lawsuits notwithstanding). Even if they had all been disproven, though, the toxic manner of interaction which he and others allied with him employ on other fora is not welcome here.

Also to be clear: this is not censorship. This is the exercise of editorial control. Anyone who is upset by this decision is free to post elsewhere, perhaps in a subreddit of their own making. I made this one, and wish to promote a healthier style of interaction between members.

I do not like taking this action. I don't like restricting discussion, and I don't like singling out one person for censure. But I believe, in the end, it will be best for this community, and if the allegations are true, it is the only respectful decision I can make for the women involved.

This post will be locked, as the decision is not up for discussion.

Be good people.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1234abc80>,osr,1594842132.0

Rediscovering a love for “vanilla.”,"I, like many others, have a chronic worldbuilding problem. 

While super fun, and one of the things I enjoy most - a nice tea brew, a pipe, and some notebooks and pens are pretty much my comfort definition these days for my spare time - it also makes things challenging sometimes. 

My constant need to have things feel “unique” or “different” can lead to more building than playing sometimes, or getting stuck in endless loops of notes I’ll never use! 

To combat this, and just to have some fun on my own, I decided to take another run at  a few classic modules solo between my usual game sessions using B/X and keeping things largely vanilla. 

Not worrying about what’s over that ridge or developing the religion beyond “new gods feel like church, old gods feel like Celtic deities” and somehow not concerning myself with the primordial origins of how dwarves came to be nor the specific hierarchical split of all goblinkind…has been freeing. 

Sometimes it feels good to just huck the dice and have a party with a dwarf a wizard a fighter and a cleric in it with good ol basic fantasy names.

For fans of sword and sorcery…,"I’m very excited to be bringing my sword and sorcery world to life in print -

Kal-Arath is an old school 2d6 system designed for solo or group play - it leans heavily into its epic sword and sorcery roots and presents a gritty world rife with conflict, where fighting monks offer blood sacrifice to demon khans and horse lords war in giant wooden ships on the endless grasslands of Kal-Arath.

You can play as anything you like - the classless system relies on the choice of attributes and skills, rather than rigid classes; you might play a warrior with a demonic pact allowing him to cast powerful blood magic, or a thief turned fighter like Conan…

Whatever you choose, the second, follow up zine (also included in this Kickstarter) “Valley of the Black Ziggurat” will put your character to the test: a deadly new region to explore, as well as adding new tables to the core book’s region for expanded points of interest, encounters, monsters and much more.

These two zines are also packed with artwork as most of my friends have come to expect from my work now, I hope!

Dear Mods and OSR Redditors,"Dear Mods and OSR Redditors 

I like this subreddit because it is the closest thing to the old G+ forum. 

On G+ people micro-blogged, people posted discussion topics, and people shared links to their blogs and crowd funding projects. 

All these activities were valued. 

In particular, sharing a blog post showed people something they may or may not have known about and/or liked. If the blog post was not your bag, you simply scrolled past. I never considered sharing a blog post to be “spamming”. That presupposes that the posters are selling that which the users do not want to see. I want to see these blog posts highlighted, to see new things. 

I like to see blog posts effectively rated by up/down votes, it throws light on interesting blog post that I might not have taken an interest in. 

I know there is a subset of redditors that hate blog posts, and only want to have discussions. But, **why are they the most important users on this subreddit?**  

Recently, there seems to be a trend on this subreddit to make this subreddit like all the boring subreddits where the mods are uber-controlling, to make this subreddit like all the other uptight subreddits. 

I don’t think blog post links should be ghettoed to a single thread (and we all know ghettoed threads are where things are sent to die), because some subredditors don’t like those kinds of post. It’s not like I have noticed an abusive amount of blog post. 

Please leave this subreddit as it has been for the last 8 or so years, there was nothing wrong with the permissive, embracive culture. Why mess with the winning formula? 

I guess I’m bringing this seeming change in policy to the fore, and the “we only like discussions posts” brigade will downvote this post hard.

“Ratmen? In my sewers? It’s more likely than you think!”,"I’m working on my own breed of rat people for a project and what will be my next campaign world. 

They’re an ancient cult of druids/sorcerers who tried to summon their elder god of riot, ruin and vermin, but were “infested” by the god instead. 

Their bodies twisted into the verminous forms they revered and used in their foul rites and now for ages, they themselves have infested the rotting and grim places of the world. 

They are spreaders of plague, haunters of narrow mounds and summoners of vermin and other rat-men from the titanic, twisting and labyrinthine warren-like body of their rotting god. 

I have these in mind as powerful enemies, but with their Skaven-style minions as a major threat to any area, possibly also dominating goblin and other humanoid forces in a region. 

Really, just reskinning Skaven because why not - but I also don’t know much Warhammer lore and love ratmen.

Fungal Forest of the Goblin Queen,"It is said that the towering walls of fungus that enclose her throne room will only open for the correct song - 

And while she slumbers these last many years, the goblins have grown forgetful on the toadstools that proliferate the shores of the dark pond, and have lost the proper music to awaken her. 

Here, the towering teeth of malachite conceal the imprisoned Blind Seer, punished for ancient crimes to his former lord. 

In the center of this subterranean mycelial majesty is the towering form of the Great One, from whence spring all the other mushrooms, revered and worshiped by the Sporeherders. 

Blue light from glowing crystal clusters illuminates the rocky towers of Archfort - and the remains of what the goblins who guard it call the Man-Road. But why is it here at all? 

This, and many more secrets hidden lie here - and further still, bitter memories stalk the hall and chamber of the Courts of the Cold King. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x123c3cc80>,osr,1732107931.0

Kicked off my new physical table campaign of Delving Deeper yesterday…,"5 hour session which is a marathon for me these days. 

I had done some basic worldbuilding stuff, just a few cultural overviews and setting the stage of law and chaos. 

Printed a Dyson map should they go into the dungeon. (They did.)

Winged a lot of the dungeon - these days as long as I have a good idea of what’s there I can lean pretty heavy on the map itself and wandering encounters for a fun delve. Lost one PC to an 8’ tall skeleton guarding the sarcophagus they were there to take a rubbing of for a magi in the city. 

A little hexcrawling on a rumor of wyverns netted (in an honest to god roll on a wandering monster table on the way to scout the wyverns) a fight with a red dragon - 

a smart use of the magic user casting darkness on an archer’s arrow after it struck the dragon led to the young dragons death, but its mature mate came into the battle soon after and roasted another PC and all their allies. 

Anyways thought I’d give folks a Quick Look - there were dungeons…AND dragons. Lots of fun and looking forward to a long campaign. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1241641a0>,osr,1728733393.0

OSR theory vs reality,"My background: Started playing D&D in 1979 with the Holmes blue box. Played regularly ever since. Witnessed the genesis and growth of the old-school renaissance movement on various forums since it started more than 15 years ago, and participated in many discussions about what made early D&D different from what came later.

And I’m here to tell you that dogma like ‘combat is a fail state in old-school D&D’ is revisionist nonsense. And the fact it gets bandied around so often is proof that the reality of how people played D&D 40 years ago has been eclipsed by theory-craft.

By the time AD&D was published, the great majority of gamers employed a mix of published and home-brew adventures. Adventures like Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, White Plume Mountain, Keep on the Borderlands, and Village of Hommlet flew off the shelves. None of these are mega-dungeons. None of them present a premise of sneaking into a dungeon and liberating it of treasure without alerting the inhabitants. In some cases, putting the inhabitants to the sword to remove a threat to civilization is the whole point of the adventure (G1, the Caves of Chaos). In others (White Plume, Hommlet, the Tower of Zenopus), the scope and layout of the dungeon does not enable the stealthy circumvention of threats.

No, when the party rolled up to the entrance of those dungeons, they were on a search a destroy missions to kill the monsters and take their stuff. Did they use deception and cunning tricks to shift the odds in their favour? Absolutely. Did they retreat from combat when they realized they were in over the heads? For sure. Did many PCs die out of bad play or bad luck? Yep.

But what they did not do is treat combat as a fail state. Rolling dice and killing monsters was the heart of the game, and the default premise of these hugely popular adventures - adventures that taught new players what D&D was about. How Gygax and a few other OGs played in 1975 was already irrelevant to the player-base by 1979. How would we have even known how Castle Greyhawk was run?

It’s cool that the OSR revived old and forgotten play modes and principles. I was part of that early dialogue, when we shared stories of desperate struggles to survive the Caverns of Thracia, or the six-level meatgrinder of a dungeon that our DM in grade 10 made over summer break. And how those experiences contrasted with the heroic, super-powered assumptions of 3.X D&D.

But the message has become garbled and distorted on forums like this, often by people who didn’t play 30+ years ago. Now they’re preaching and enforcing an orthodoxy that would have been absolutely baffling to a bunch of 15 year olds chucking dice in a rec room in the 80s.

Tldr: The OSR principles that get bandied on forums like this are not reflective of how the great majority of people played D&D in the first decade of its publication. They were crafted and championed with the aim of reviving a very narrow approach to play that was - until recently - not widely adopted or even known about.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1242ae870>,osr,1678209088.0

Final Revisions to the Dark Sun OSE conversion,"How is it going everybody? I just completed the revisions to the whole OSE Dark Sun conversion. This is a series of improvements and restructuring and additions to all booklets to make the conversion more appealing to both players and DMs who want to play a Dark Sun Campaign.To begin with, the Conversion is separated in 4 Booklets: The Genre Rules (Previously called Character Creation), The Dungeon Master's Guide (Previously called Guide for DMs), The Monster Manual and a separate book for Psionic and Magic Rules. All Booklets in the conversion include printing guidelines for printing them in A5 format, their pdfs are bookmarked for ease for reference and all of them have some additions and changes, listed as follows:

* Genre Rules: This one has the least changes overall, I took out the psionics and magic rules and changed them for equipment, followers and stronghold rules, similar to its equivalent in the OSE Box Set.
* Dungeon Master's Guide: This one had the most additions. Basically I added more tools and tips for DMs for how to run a Dark Sun Game, with tips regarding tracking resources, and explanation to the Athasian Calendar, a series of potential adventure and campaign scenarios for inspiration and a lot of random tables, such as: Trinkets, Settlement Generation, City-State Generation, Dungeon Generation and more! I also moved here the appendix L: House Rules, previously present in the Character Creation Booklet, as it was honestly more fitting to be present here. I am also repeating the rules for equipment present in the genre rules, that way both DMs and Players are able to reference weapons and armor easily on the table.
* Monster Manual: This one didn't have much to add, but I added two monster, the Crystal Spyder and the Zhackal, present in the original monster compendium.
* Psionics & Magic: This one had some additions still in regards to methods for defiling (Like defiling while preparing spells rather than during casting) and Obsidian Orbs, a rather bold invention of mine, basically spell batteries that contain energy for spells combined with sith holocrons from Star Wars, I know, of Apocryphal within the Canon, but I couldn't help to add them because I thought they were so cool!

Now, some of you made the question as to when it would be safe to print the booklets, to which I finally say you guys can do it, as I won't be adding anything else to the conversion that I think is important to enjoy the setting to its fullest, or at least not in the foreseeable future. Rather, I'll slowly work in making the big tome that will have everything in just one book, but the only changes within it will be the referencing of pages, table of contents and bookmarking, so rest assured that your print out of this project will not be missing out of anything. I also made a Character Sheet! This is honestly not my strength,  I feel it's rather simplistic, but I still think it is functional and easy to use, I will not be sending it in PDF, rather I'll send it in PPT format, so you easily copy it and fill it with no issues if you are running a game online. Thank you so much for your support, this has been an amazing experience for me, I'll now take my time to start my own athasian campaign and start working on some other projects I am super excited about. Now is your turn, however go out and have the best games you can and enjoy all the excitement the ravaged world of Athas is capable to provide!

A Long Overdue Thankyou to the Reddit OSR Community…,"Sorry it has taken so long to say, but Thankyou to all the members here who have done such a great job monitoring the art frauds who have been stealing my work and claiming it as their own. Part of the explanation this Thanks comes so belatedly is because I have been (luckily) busy drawing and painting. So this means I’ll be notified that I’ve been tagged in a post somewhere and it’s a person from this community who has taken the time to appreciate what I do, to remember it, and to my eternal gratification: eviscerate the imposter in the comments. I can only offer art in return, so here’s something I did for The Shrike by Leo Hunt and Joel Hines at Silverarm Press… 

It concerns a part of the game where a young girl and an old man live in a forest of tree sized candelabras, and she believes if she can light the limbs of each one she will be freed of her miserable situation… it’s a really tragic and touching part of the module, and I tried my best to depict her Sisyphean task… perhaps we can extend this to be analogous to the work of this community, trying to keep the lights on in an ever increasingly dim world….

ShadowDark,"Before I begin I will preface this by saying:

Kelsey Dionne has not asked the mod team (nor has she paid us) to say this. She has been quietly responding to every allegation herself and Im embarrassed.

I’m embarrassed that our normally welcoming community has been hostile and abrasive to her creation; attributing her success to paying off talking heads for good reviews and not her hard work.

Ben Milton has been paid to review ShadowDark, he is the sole person who has been paid to review ShadowDark.

We should be celebrating the success of an OSR inspired game in hopes that it brings more traction to our niche corner of the hobby instead of acting like jealous children.

I don’t want to have to enforce this but conspiracy theorists will be looking at harsher punishments for future allegations.

About ten years ago, a fellow on a facebook Old School RPG sale page offered it for free, with the buyer paying postage. I had never heard of it before, was curious, so I took it off his hands.

I've flipped through it several times over the years, and read various sections, but this past holiday season, I decided give it a read-through and see if there was anything worth lifting for the OSR campaign I'm writing.

Strangely, Fantasy Wargaming is a novel-sized book rather than the usual oversized RPG publication. Somehow, that makes the rules more difficult to digest; I'm not sure why. There are very few illustrations, but lots and lots of charts and graphs.

The first 100 pages is lore and history; the author draws on various time periods and cultures. Next, is a long article about the fantasy works that inspired his vision: mainly Moorcock and Vance, but plenty of others.

After that, a long section on character creation (one of the photos is a sample character sheet), and a long section on gameplay. Finally, more info on the world.

There are a lot of good ideas here, but every idea sinks under cumbersome and/or too many rules. Creating a character alone might take an entire afternoon. Combat rules have almost too many variations, covering too many situations. Magic is similar. I almost wonder if anyone ever played this game, and if the game is playable at all!

Anyway, I thought I'd share. This is the only sub that would be remotely interested in this relic!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x124660830>,osr,1735933534.0

Swords Against Blood Magic!,"A little painting from my own Kal-Arath setting. 

My color painting is really amateur-level but wanted to share here anyways for those who may still appreciate the vibe. 

Inside this ancient temple are mystics drunk on rotting blood, performing unspeakable rites to honor their demon lord. 

They are not hardy, but their magic is unpredictable, powerful, and deadly. 

Guarding heavy door at ground level are a small group of corrupted horse lords. 

Within, thick incense obscures a huge chamber where three naked youths are chained to an altar ⛓️

If what the villagers told you is correct - There are 5 mystics chanting amid that acrid fog…

What’s the best approach?

Why you should splurge and get OSR print products,"You are possibly aware that a new version of 5e is dropping, called One D&D. They are eliminating the concept of an ""edition"" in favor of continuously updating rules, offering an online ecosystem of virtual tabletop services, and revising the core books. They're suggesting it's the last edition of D&D.

I know a lot of people here don't care about WotC D&D, but what I'm interested in thinking about is where WotC D&D is headed and what that means for TTRPG people who've opted out of their Great Reset.

To understand what's happening, it helps to look at academia. Publishers realized their biggest competition was the previous editions of their own books: Students would buy used copies, even of previous editions that were ""similar enough"". In order to make lots of filthy lucre, the publishers realized it wasn't enough to just change chapter titles and shuffle content around. Now they ""rent"" books and put content online behind subscription paywalls. Why? To limit competition. This is anti-competitive. It's about money. It's a way to force people to pay more for their products. Think Microsoft Office365.

Why is WotC doing what they're doing? They are embracing the ""product-as-a-service"" model and eliminating the competition from their own past book releases (as well as vertically integrating the whole online ttrpg experience to eat Roll20 et al's lunch). The point is that 5e is too big and well established to ""kill"" in one shot with a new 6e, so they have to move that massive player base to a new model while simultaneously making the existing 5e books obsolete. They are transitioning D&D to a model where there are no books or terrain or dice and everything is on your device. You get an account, you log in, everyone has their virtual table top open. There is nothing in meatspace. No dice, no pencils or paper, no books, no minis. You will be able to get the books for a few more cycles (7-10 years), and after that they will be ""deluxe slipcase"" editions for like $300 or a starter box set that is mostly about getting people acclimated to the online product. But no one will play D&D as an ""analog"" tabletop game anymore.

So once a sufficient number of people are plugged in to this new product, they'll quietly stop with the books. Why publish books? A $30-50 book sits on your shelf forever. The d&d service will be, whatever, $8-15 a month plus the texture packs and add-ons and supplementary content. That's more money a year than a copy of the PHB anyway, which you can resell (of course, most 5e players don't read it anyway, so what do they care if it gets taken away?). Enjoy renting your hobby, forever, you poor sucker.

Even if I'm wrong and WotC wants to keep a robust publishing business going in principle, the post-5e crowd is going to be functionally and mechanically illiterate because they will spend all their time relying on the app and the DM to offer their choice sets and resolve outcomes. Demand for the books will dry up, and WotC will be OK with that: Newspapers don't really want to print the things anymore, either, except at exorbitant rates.

You know the 3.5"" floppy icon that is used as the ""save"" symbol in lots of software, even though no one has used a floppy disk in decades? You're going to have a button that looks like a 20-sided die, you press it, and a random number occurs, and young people will be like, ""What is that funny looking icon?"" 

I am pointing this out to say, please buy print OSR products. First, the creators benefit from your support. But the ""OSR"" experience might increasing refer not just to the rules system or play experience but to the physical reality of the experience. Dice, pencils, paper, minis, humans looking at each other, books. A real shared experience that isn't a commercialized thing intermediated by WotC but a spontaneous and creative experience. Whether you use theater-of-the-mind or minis, that's about to vanish with D&D in the next 5 to 10 years, and D&D is like 90% of the ttrpg market.

If you own the book, no one can take it from you. No one can quietly change your digital copy because they don't like the mechanics or ideas. It's a piece of real art that you can appreciate in a world where everything is disposable and companies see it as their right to edit culture whenever it's profitable or convenient for them to do so.

In the future, digital things will die constantly. They will be even more disposable than the cheap plastic garbage that has flooded our lives and environment. D&D rules will become an ever-changing set of patch notes of nonsense. Competing products will rise up and die out and nothing will mark their coming or going, like so many dead digital worlds whose servers have been shut off forever.

But if you have the book, it was real. It happened. And it can happen again, just the way the author intended and the way you remember. You just need some dice and friends and imagination.

A treasure hoard of ancient minis,"A friend from my Viking reenactment group gave me her late husband’s D&D minis from back in the day. This little tub must weigh 20 pounds and is stuffed full of Grenadier and Ral Partha lead from the 70’s and 80’s. Fighting Men, nude slave women, clerics with crucifixes, pig-faced orcs—this is pure grognard energy!

It was especially meaningful because her husband was really into D&D, and she didn’t want these minis just sitting around the house not being enjoyed by anyone.

Couple questions: 1) These are pure lead. Knowing what we know now, would people feel comfortable gaming with any pieces that I wash and fully paint? And 2) How fugging sick is that Deathdealer mini, huh?! I nearly lost it when I unearthed that one.

Just ran my first session of Keep on the Borderlands for an 8 player in person game using B/X.,"I made a d8 table of hooks or one sentence backstories for each character that wouldn’t make or break the campaign - just give them a decent reason to be there and work together.

I changed up quite a few things from the module as a few OGs at the table had run it before and I wanted to surprise them. 

Mine became more a story about the corrupt Curate working for the Master of a horrible and nameless cult, and a slaver conspiracy run by the Guild House in the keep. 

A few dumb moves by players got the elf killed in their first combat, so he immediately switched to playing one of the NPCs they’d hired and barely missed a round of fighting.

Opinion: D&D Forgets It's Horror Roots,"Sword & Sorcery was often horror with swords.  The authors were contemporaries and friends of Lovecraft and even used and expanded on his lore in their works.  Conan faced unimaginable creatures that shattered the mind to think about.  Robert E Howard and Clark Ashton Smith were writing the same stuff as Lovecraft, just in a different setting.  This was what Arneson and Gygax grew up reading.

The first fantasy game that would become D&D was conceived by Dave Arneson after a weekend of watching horror movies.

The first players to enter the first dungeon walked a little way in, heard some disturbing noises, said ""Oh, hell no!"" and ran out.

A dungeon is a horror movie more than a fantasy movie. It is dark and it should be terrifying.  Role playing is mostly about the actions a character does in these very dangerous situations, not the voices.  I think play loses a lot of flavor when the horror element is lost and the players aren't behaving as terrified individuals would in that situation.

My idea of a perfect dungeon crawl moment is the beginning of ""Aliens"".  They walk in cocky and then drive out petal-to-the-metal screaming and don't stop until someone pries Ripley's fingers off the accelerator.  That's a moment your players will never forget.

Re: AI artwork vs. Human Made,"Not trying be overly preachy re: AI, buuuut…

It’s not even about whether it is right or wrong from a moral standpoint, I’m sure most of you who may not do artwork can understand how difficult it might be for some of us who have made our livelihood this way to see ourselves start being replaced. 

I’m just talking about how it feels - it might be that in a few months or years, handmade art has just become a niche product or a luxury item…that feels like a major potential bummer. Seriously. 

In the meantime, there are so many rad creatives in the RPG and game scene - sometimes it doesn’t hurt to just ask. 

This piece is one I did for free to replace an AI cover I saw here on Reddit. 

I’ll do free art when I can make the time for those who are too broke to afford it - and hopefully, just having artwork made by humans on the cover of your project will generate more interest in it from those to whom that is important.

Reaffirming r/osr’s support for diversity,"The mod team of r/osr wants to publically reaffirm our support for LGTBQA+ people. Men and women, black, latino, asian, or any other ethnicity. Religious and Athiest/Agnostic. We, the mods, support you and will react appropriately if you experience harassment in our subreddit. We expect the community of r/osr to do the same, to treat everyone on the reddit with respect and equality. If you are uncomfortable with this, I would suggest you either find a reddit more supportive of your beliefs or keep them to yourself. I say re-affirming because this has always been our (unstated) position and we have had the rainbow dice as our banner for awhile now as a subtle statement of this.

If anyone on this site is experiencing harassment, please do report it AND message the mods. We want to know about it AND track it. Do not call it out and say “I’m going to report you”. We have banned people from r/osr and have the option to go so far as to present it to the reddit admins - who can ban someone from reddit completely.

Without diminishing the above, I do want to point out that we strive to treat everyone equally. We support diversity - and the rules are the same for everyone. You do not get to be rude because you are Athiest. You do not get to break the self promotions rules because you’re Asexual. You do not get to be distruptive to the community. Please remember that respectful arguments and disagreement are NOT harassment. It may feel like it, and I encourage you to reach out to the mods if you think you’re being harassed in any sense. But if people are arguing with you, please consider that it may NOT be because of your status, but because your opinion needs reevaluation. We’re all human and sometimes our emotions get the better of us.

Thank you again to the r/osr community. The mods all know how awesome a community you are. Keep up the good work. In these stressful times remember that there is another person on the other end of the intertubes. You don’t know their challenges, and they don’t know yours.

Mothership is Awesome! ,"Just ran my first session of Mothership Sci-Fi Horror RPG last night. We did a one-shot investigating an agricultural research station on an exoplanet that failed to report in. 

The thing that seemed great to me is that you could probably turn the dial of horror or sci-fi up or down as you see fit. You could definitely run a space dungeon crawler in here just as easily as *Alien*. 

To anyone who is even remotely interested, I wholeheartedly recommend it! The game has a website that teaches you how to play, a companion app for checking what gear does/rolling dice/making characters, and an absolutely awesome deluxe set that comes with multiple amazing rulebooks/modules. I included a photo of it below! 

Otherwise, I’d love to hear what you love about Mothership, or if it’s not your cup of tea, what other sci-fi games you enjoy running! ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x127099bb0>,osr,1730398906.0

PSA: LotFP has sexual violence built into the core rules,"Lamentations of the Flame Princess has >!rape, genital mutilation!< and sexual violence built into the core rules/mechanics, in the random tables in the ""Summon"" spell. Following Rules as Written, you may be ""forced"" (or at least asked) to roleplay through these acts of sexual violence.

Why post this PSA? I believe, due to the nature of sexual violence and its affect on people and society, that anything containing sexual violence should be clearly labeled as such. Especially with RPG's, where you might be asked to role-play through sexual violence, I believe that it needs to be explicitly cleared with everyone involved.

I regularly see people recommending LotFP along side Basic Fantyasy RPG, OSE, Swords & Wizardry, etc, without making it clear that LotFP has these components of sexual violence built into its core rules, and the others do not. I think a lot of people must not be aware of this, and so I'm posting this so people are aware and can make their own decisions fully informed. Again, this is not just part of the setting of LotFP, it is part of the Core Rules.

For me, it's important that I can hand a player or potential player the ""Core Rulebook"" or ""Players Handbook"" and NOT have them exposed to descriptions of >!rape or genital mutilation!<. I have friends that have been >!raped, and some that have been molested as children!<, and these kinds of descriptions and reminders are traumatizing to them. So it's important to me that they are clearly labeled.

LotFP states ""18+ Explicit Content"", but I'm guessing most people (including me), expect it to mean more ""sexual content and innuendo"" and less ""sexual violence"". I wish Raggi was more clear about what is meant by ""18+ Explicit Content"".

Just to be clear, in order to trigger these mechanics you need to have a character cast the spell ""Summon"", fail a check or two, and then roll just right on the random tables for the spell. There is a good chance most people playing LotFP have never seen these mechanics in action. Also, as a side note, the ""Summon"" spell encourages human sacrifice, in that it will provide a bonus to the caster for some of the random rolls.

The section in question is in the free ""LotFP Weird Fantasy Role-Playing - Player Core Book:Rules & Magic"" (file name LotFPRulesMagicFreeNoArt.pdf)? Here is a quote from that pdf, from under the Summon spell in the Spell Descriptions (pages 134-143, the exact quote coming from pages 141-142 in the subsection 6:""Lust of a Betrayed Lover""):

""All characters within the local area (to be deter- mined by the situation) roll 1d6. Those that roll a 1 are at fault for the situation. All characters not at fault will become allies in the drive to hunt down, subdue, >!and mutilate the genitals !<of all who are at fault. After this is done, all who are not at fault must make a saving throw versus Magic. Those who fail will seek to kill the parties at fault, and all who stand in their way of doing so. The effect ends only when all of the characters at fault have been dealt with, although they will not be hostile with any of the characters present who are not at fault , even if they were hostile or longtime enemies before Summon was cast. If nobody is at fault, then things will get ugly. All characters become obsessed and fixated on one random other character in the vicinity, and >!will attempt to have sex with that character!<—at any cost. The character will first attempt to subdue the subject of his obsession, to unconscious if he can or death if he must, before>! having his way!<. Male- female pairings will result in conception, and 10% of male-male pairings will as well. The offspring will be an otherworldly creature—use these Summon charts to determine exactly what, assuming a 1 HD creature—which will do>! 1d10 damage to a woman carrying it as it is born, 2d10 to a man!<. The effect ends for a character when >!his lust is sated!<.""

It currently is linked from [lotfp.com](https://lotfp.com) and is on DriveThruRPG

Edit: I kind of feel like those who are saying ""It's LotFP and Raggi - It should be obvious what it's going to contain"" are being purposefully obtuse. I wouldn't be surprised if LotFP is in the top 20 OSR games recommended by people on this site - but it's the ONLY game commonly recommended that contains any sexual violence in the core rules. Hence this PSA post.

Edit 2: I really dislike moralizing regarding violence in games, because I feel it leads to silly and pointless quagmires. That said, there are real world scenarios where violence can have a  pragmatic purpose. For instance, defending ones family from a murderer, or defending your country from a conquering force. But there is never a scenario where sexual violence is pragmatic - it is always sadistic, meant to tear down, subvert, violate and destroy. That is why it's treated differently.

Edit 3: This post got way more attention than I expected. I want to make it clear, I am opposed to censorship and support Freedom of Speech. This wasn't a ""call to action"", but if I was going to make a suggestion or request, it would be that when you recommend LotFP, include a warning that it contains sexual violence. You can link to this post if you want.

Anyway, I'm done here for now. This post is way too long. I'm going to spend my time on things more enjoyable, like looking at the newest settings and OSE adaptations!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1272aa450>,osr,1701044211.0

"Announcement: Any future ""Zak S won a lawsuit"" posts will be deleted.","Folks,

A little over a year ago, first-hand accounts of abuse of women by Zak Sabbath/Zak S/Zak Smith appeared in various places over the web. This has led to at least one lawsuit, but, to my knowledge, not all of the accusations have been refuted. I do not claim to know the veracity of these accusations, but they come from multiple sources and are not, on the face of it, unbelievable. Due to an overabundance of caution, then, I made the difficult decision to ban Zak from this forum, a ban which remains in place today.

**But, to get to the point:** regardless of whether or not the accusations are true, posts about someone being sued by Zak are not ""industry news""; the OSR is only barely an ""industry"", for one thing. For another, and more importantly, announcements about someone paying Zak S money do not help anyone play their games. They do not lead to productive discussions, nor do I see any indication that they have changed anyone's mind on the subject. Therefore, any such posts will be deleted from hereon in. Anyone making multiple attempts to post them will be banned.

On a related note, any ""I owe Zak S an apology"" posts will be deleted if the person posting it did not make an accusation on this subreddit.

Anyone accusing me of fascism is welcome to create their own blog or subreddit praising Zak S to the high heavens. If you do, please pay close attention when jackbooted thugs do *not* break down your door and arrest you. But note also that using such abusive language is a bannable offense.

This sums up old school play perfectly.,"I had an exchange with a player in my weekly White Box game that sums up the old school experience perfectly. The elf wizard (whose player was accustomed to 5e) had obtained a strange potion and wanted to know what it was. Here’s what happened:

Player: So what do I have to roll to know what this potion is?
DM: There is no roll. What do you do to figure out what this potion is?
Player: Oh. Well, first I look at it. What does it look like?
DM: The glass vial is round at the bottom with a long, thin stem holding in a cork. It’s filled with a murky black fluid the consultancy of honey.
Player: I uncork it and smell the fluid.
DM: A horrible, pungent smell exudes from the vial. Make a saving throw!
Player: Uh oh! Umm, I fail.
DM: You vomit a little on the cobblestones.

Why I replace the d20 with 3d8 in every d20 system I run.,"I originally implemented this houserule last year as part of a combat overhaul I was writing for 5e. I’ve since come to use it in any d20 system I run, and it has a huge number of benefits (many geared more toward OSR) that I wanted to share for others to consider or even try. As a disclaimer: I’m not saying this way is better, despite how much I prefer it, or that using a d20 is somehow worse. Every table runs things differently, and it’s hard to exaggerate the d20’s success in ttrpg. But, this simple replacement changes the feel of a game so drastically, I have to put forth an argument for it.

# The 3d8 engine:

* Any time you make a check that requires a d20, roll 3d8 instead, using the sum as your base roll and adding modifiers like normal. Positive circumstances or ‘advantage’ adds a d8, negative circumstances or ‘disadvantage’ subtracts a d8.
* For attacks, every natural 8 rolled adds a damage die, and two or more natural 8s trigger “critical” effects (automatic hits, status conditions, etc). If you’d like, you can say 2 or more natural 1s trigger fumbles as well.
* To compensate for the higher average roll, add between +2 and +4 to all target numbers/DCs (I do +2, more might be suitable to your table).

# The math:

Here’s what this does to the probabilities (skip this part if you don’t care about the math).

* Most importantly it turns the flat 5% distribution for any roll into a bell curve, where middle or average rolls are more likely, while rolls at the highest and lowest ends of the range are less likely.
* It gives you a wider range of rolls (3 to 24), and increases the average roll from 10.5 to about 13.5.
* There’s a 3 in 8 chance of getting some extra damage, but a 3 in 64 chance of a crit (plus a little extra with the \~1% from rolling all 8s), ~~about 4.8%~~ \[edit:  ≈4.3%, thank you u/emarsk\] (very close to the original 5%).

# What this does to your game:

The first and greatest factor is an increase in **player agency**, directly due to the bell curve distribution of rolls. With a normal d20, your +2 or +5 or whatever modifier can very easily be washed out by an unlucky roll. You need a very large modifier to be sure of your ability to tackle larger challenges, which is why games like 5e require so many buffs and bonuses to give players confidence to run their characters. With more consistent, average dice rolls, **your players will develop a more natural intuition of what they can do and expect from their stats**.

However, with the extra swingyness of damage from every d8, **combat becomes more exciting and engaging**, despite most rolls being more consistent. Furthermore, it makes it more **deadly** (read: risky and exciting!) because of the higher overall damage output from both sides. **Martials get a much needed buff** next to their spellcasting counterparts, and spellcasters aren’t as powerless when they run out of spells.

DMs can also **more easily predict and control the difficulty of their encounters** without a string of bad (or very good) luck derailing the fight (as often at least). Also, advantage and disadvantage change both the average and the range, making them much more tactically significant, and affect the amount of maximum extra damage dice you may receive on natural 8s/crits. This all gives DMs more control both when prepping and on the fly.

Lastly, **character progression feels more significant**. With a d20, getting another +1 to a stat moves only the range, but you’re barely more likely to roll a higher roll than you were before because every number in that range is just as likely. By moving the peak of your bell curve, your +1 matters more because those higher DC checks are much more consistent now.

# Preemptive rebuttals:

*Why not 2d10?* The bell curve is stronger with more dice, and crits would become very rare for rolling two 10s, and remove the chances of triple or quadruple damage. (You might find this beneficial and do this instead.)

*Why not 3d6 or 4d6?* I found the crit chances to be far too swingy on d6s, but you might want that and are free to use d6s instead.

*What about my favorite hand carved unicorn horn d20 I sold my car for?* You can still use a d20 for completely random things like initiative or death saves (if using those things). I’ve even been suggested that spellcasters use a d20 to preserve the unpredictability of the arcane.

*Doesn’t adding up more numbers every roll take up more time?* It does, and I’ve noticed the effect to be more extreme for newer players, but you get used to it. I think the benefits are worth the learning (bell) curve (budum tss), and I’ve even introduced this system to people entirely new to ttrpg with little complaint.

*What about \[insert some math knowledge here\], your numbers are wrong!* Look, I’m not here to write a math thesis, I’m here to play ttrpgs with my friends. Regardless of the exact percentages, the feel of my games are changed in a way that works better for how I run them. I’m much more interested in hearing about how you tried it and the effects it had than arguing about math on the internet. I’m sure something I said about the math somewhere was off, I did my best to double check my numbers, but months of playtesting has made me confident in how the game itself is affected and that’s what I’m really posting about. **I welcome polite corrections to my math**, I want them even, but I’ve seen people get very rude over it, so please do so kindly.

Let me know what you think, and best wishes to anyone brave enough to endure my drivel of a write up.

Rise - a very rule-lite OSR ,"
Hi all!

I'm so happy to release my new game: Rise. 
It's a very rule-lite OSR that fits on a single business card.

It features: Character creation, 20 Backgrounds, 12 Traits, 12 Magic powers, Combat rules, Test rules, Enemy system.

I personally use it to play solo game with [Silver Nightingale's Solo Toolkit](https://silvernightingale.itch.io/ultimate-one-page-rpg-toolkit) and [Quest Generator](https://silvernightingale.itch.io/quest-generator) and I really love it!
You can use it for group-play as well 😉

My 5E Group Hated OSE - a post mortem.,"I'm pretty bummed out right now. After just 3 sessions I am pulling the plug on a new OSE campaign I started with friends just last month.  I'm not really sure the point of this post except to share my experience and some lessons learned.

I'd been wanting to run an OSE campaign for awhile but my friends love 5E and had no interest in it. A few of them adamantly said they will play nothing else but 5E.  ""Why do we need to learn a new system?"" was the common response.  I finally got to a point where I decided to just say ""hey, here's what I'm running... join if you'd like to.""  This was probably the first mistake but I was actually somewhat successful as people were interested in playing more D&D and so I sold it as this is D&D but an older version with lighter rules (more rulings, less rules).  The ""5E or nothing"" friends passed on it but I did get a few friends to commit to playing.

The campaign was set in the Wilderlands of High Fantasy and I scattered a bunch of level 1-2 dungeons (Hole in the Oak, Incandescent Grottoes) and mega-dungeons (Castle Xyntillan) around a local area of the map.  I put a couple plot hooks out there to lead the players to the dungeons.  This is where things started to fall apart.  This group in particular had very little player agency and they immediately became paralyzed by the number of choices.  Coming from 5E, they expected me to clue them in on the ""best"" choice.  They wanted me to spoon feed them the optimal choice.  This was the first sign that this wasn't going to work.

Eventually they chose a quest that would bring them to the Hole in the Oak dungeon. However, as luck would have it, they took a path through the dungeon that caused them to awaken the Spectral Hunter and Hounds as their first combat encounter (an extremely hard undead monster for 1st levels).  I emphasized running away and this being a nearly impossible fight at this level.  They made it out alive (shields were shattered) but this left an incredibly bad taste in their mouth.  This was definitely another big mistake on my part. Looking back, I probably shouldn't have triggered this encounter.  I did roll on the reaction table and gave the party a chance to negotiate a way out before combat began but everything went against the players that I felt I had to go through with the combat.  This group really did not like unbalanced encounters or the difficulty involved.  They were not prepared for the difficulty level.  When people say old school D&D is like Dark Souls, they ain't lying.

The next session the party went back to town and had to ""lick their wound"".  They hated how long it took to heal (spending a full day resting to recover 1d3).   They had burned a lot of resources (torches, rations, splintered shields) exploring the dungeon and had very little to show for it.    They sold what little treasure they did find and then had to replenish their supplies.  They started complaining about the mundane activities at this point... managing rations... managing torches... retainers.  They hated all of it.  They did not care for the micromanagement aspect at all or the verisimilitude that these systems provide. Planning for the adventure was not fun to them. They wanted to get straight to the adventure/dungeon and the narrative.

Wilderness travel was a mixed bag with them actively disliking the mechanics of it  (weather, checking lost chance, encounters, eating rations).  One friend commented that if they actually get lost and they spend a whole session wandering aimlessly he would quit.   At this point I realized that they all had no interest in ""emergent"" gameplay and really just wanted me to hand a narrative story/adventure to them.   Even when cool randomly generated map features came up they didn't bother to explore them and instead stuck to the ""quest""/narrative.  They stayed on the rails even though I was giving them a sandbox.

After this last session,  everyone had just about had enough.  The OSR play style was not jiving with them.  One by one they all agreed it was not for them and tapped out.  I've come to realize that this is a very passive group from a player agency perspective and they really want the narrative, on rails story to be handed to them for them to respond to rather then driving it themselves.  To me, this is the biggest difference between OSR games and 5E.  The play style is remarkably different and I understand that now.

I hope this post may be interesting to some of you and that you can learn from my mistakes.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x128a3c860>,osr,1666030092.0

Rules about self-promotion,"Hi folks, just wanted to let you know what does and doesn't count as ""spam"" for the purposes of self-promotion here. This is both for the benefit of would-be promoters, and for us the mods, so we don't get overwhelmed by ""this is spam"" alerts for things that aren't really spam.

Communities like this exist in part because there are products for it, and products exist in part because there is a chance of a (probably small) profit from them, and profits exist in part because people know of the product, so, with that in mind, here are **The Rules:**

1. You are allowed to announce your blog or product *once*. An exception can be made for things like, e.g., Kickstarter, for an announcement within 48 hours of the funding deadline or once the product has funded. (EDIT: or contact the mods if you are uncertain.)

2. You must make a full disclosure that you are promoting your own work *in the post title*, such as ""I put up my new adventure on drivethrurpg"", or ""I have a new blog, I hope you like it"".

3. It would be best if you already have a presence here on /r/osr, but second best would be to become a regular, making productive posts and comments about works or ideas that *aren't* your own stuff. This is a fuzzy rule, I understand, but if the *only* things we see from someone are self-promotions, there is a good chance subsequent entries will be blocked, or the user will be banned.

4. This should go without saying, but the work must be germane to the topic of OSR-style gaming.

5. Feel free to post updates to your blog weekly, but no more frequently than that.

6. Rules for posts also apply to comments; if your product or blog *really* relates to the topic at hand, feel free to link, but rickroll-style responses are *verboten*. (Rule #2 also applies here.)

7. In general, this subreddit has a ""two strikes and you're out"" rule, but blatant and deliberate disregard for the rules counts as two strikes.

While not a rule—yet—we'd appreciate it if anything that deals with excessive gore, explicit sex, or other adult topics were labeled ""NSFW"". 

We also reserve the right to unlink any post or product that has as its aim the marginalization of anyone based on social category: age, race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion—you know the drill. (People who call this ""censorship"" are probably not smart enough to be members or /r/osr.)

In short, be transparent, don't overdo it, and we hope your work reflects well not only on yourself, but the OSR community in general. Good luck!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x128f8b710>,osr,1572028283.0

"I've never had more fun playing DND in my life, and I have no one to gush with.","While I was always interested in DND, I never got the chance to play until a friend introduced me to 5e 5 or 6 years ago. Since then I've run 3 full-length campaigns with the same loyal friends. like many of you, though, I'm sure, I've become burnt out with the Mary Sue archetypes and the bloated, boring combat.

Recently a group of coworkers expressed interest in playing DND, and I knew this was my chance.   


I introduced them to OSE. We hung out, had some beers, rolled 3D6 down the line, and everyone was into it. I took a tip from RuneHammer and explained to them that this was a sacred ritual; a right of passage for all true table-top gamers. We had a BLAST making characters, seeing how the dice would roll.

I used a few dungeons from Gavin as inspiration and crafted my own 1st level OSR tutorial dungeon, complete with giant spiders, deadly traps, naive and helpful kobolds (in exchange for some coin) and a discovery-based narrative that lead to the reawakening of Lolth, the Spider Queen.

Just one coworker was a 5e vet, the other three where total newbies. The 5e vet tried to take a rest after the very first encounter, and I encouraged them to think twice about trying to stay the night in a dangerous dungeon without supplies. Spiders were lurking. They got the point, and from there, it was full immersion.

One of the players got his head caved in immediately. He triggered a trap and failed his save. I felt terrible, he was playing a gentle-giant aspiring botanist  gargantuan. From a previous encounter and skill check it was already clear he was the party's strong man. Seeing his head cave in from one careless step really set the tone, and he was a total champion about it.

We had a spare cleric ready to go and he was back in the game the next room, and he picked up the transition perfectly.

They used problem solving, creativity, cunning, equipment and wits to solve puzzles, disarm traps, ward off giant spiders, and get the treasure. They got their EXP and all 4 of them are ready for more. The 5e vet said he had ""an amazing time.""

I fucking love the OSR, guys. My regular 5e group shows absolute zero interest, but honestly, I don't know how I could ever go back...",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1291618e0>,osr,1652832858.0
Decided to fully embrace the OsR and now I’m playing the best dnd of my life.,"Like a lot of folks I skipped 4th Edition D&D, and returned to the hobby with 5th Edition. It really felt like D&D had returned to its roots and hooked me right back in. Since then I’ve exclusively DM’d 5e and mostly had a blast. Eventually I started to get this nagging feeling that something was missing. I was growing tired of the narrative focused, super heroic style and started yearning for the old school style of adventuring for gold and glory. Like a lot of people I started hacking the system apart trying to find ways to manipulate my players into playing something that honestly they weren’t all that interested in. 

  I eventually learned about the OsR scene, but I just couldn’t commit to some of the, what I considered “antiquated rules”, and ended up playing a watered down version. Of course this didn’t work and I went back to 5e. I once again hacked and slashed until I thought for sure I had the perfect osr 5e experience. I was wrong. It quickly devolved into superheroes but with this time without the narrative that holds it together. I went back to the drawing board and started absorbing everything I could about what made osr tick. I eventually realized that the systems I criticized before like gold as xp had very specific reasons for existing. They completely change player motivations and lead to the exact gameplay experience I was looking for. 

  At this point I was all in. I didn’t just want osr, I wanted the most osr, osr, ever. I wanted Blackmoor. I wanted a large group of players, a massive hex map, and a persistent world with meticulous time keeping. I wanted domain play, high lethality, lack of balance and a focus on exploration. I went to work and built a world. At the same time, like a sign from the dice gods, Questing Beast released a video literally detailing the exact thing I was working on. Anyway this is getting long, so long story short I did it. I now have an open table group of 26 players and growing, (m hoping to hit Gygax’s number of 50 players) and I’m playing the BEST games of dnd I’ve ever experienced. It has the exact feel I was trying to achieve. I have players exploring the wilds. Forming organizations. Building taverns. Forming adventuring guilds.

I know its not everyone's cup of tea but I have grown to become addictive to it and the fact that it diminishes session preparation to just a 1-2 hours before players show up is definitely a big plus. 

Is anyone else from the OSR community doing improv gming or I am a lonely weirdo on this?

The Ruins of Bitterfort,"
On the banks of the Hardrun River, the Bitterfort used to be men’s foothold against the often dangerous Wyrdwood. 

Those days are long gone now, and relegated to the past - trees and brambles now grow through the stones, and new denizens have taken up residence.

A group of militant and particularly brutal orcs, led by a Wyr captain await a special group of guests - the Dréadh coven of Black Hill. 

An evil ritual is underway to the Wyr’s dark lords - and even grimmer plans to recover a lost relic from the ruins of Fallenstar.

Beyond the fort, the remnants of Elfgate Bridge - once said to be the entrance to the Underworld kingdom of Alberon and Tanía…

Men would trade goods and safely traverse the Man-Road, and all prospered. 

Those days, too, have fallen into nothing more than sorrow and legend.

A Grognard's Principles for Prepping and Running OSR Games,"I've played a lot of OSR games, and with it, I have crafted some guiding principles that have served my games well. Hope this can be of help, and invite discussion of what principles others follow.

# Preparing For a Session

## 1. Your first session should start just outside the dungeon entrance

  * __Reason__: Having the first session begin directly outside of the dungeon immediately gives the players a clear objective—explore the dungeon. This lets the session hit the ground running as players will jump immediately into action. Not to mention, this gives your preparation a clear end point.

     * Really, any clear objective and confined location should work since it simplifies prep to one location so the players can immediately jump into the meat of the game.

## 2. Ask what your players will do next session

 * __Reason__: Sessions are best when you have good preparation, so leaving things ambiguous as to what the characters will do session can lead to a lot of wasted prep. Be upfront with your players and say what they decide is what you will prepare, so no changing minds last second. They will understand and it will make your game world all the better.

## 3. Only prepare for the next session

 * __Reason__: Over-prepping is more likely to burn you out than help you. __Broad stroke ideas are enough for hooks to leave your players. They do not need to be fleshed out until they will be encountered in the upcoming session__.

## 4. Sprinkle hooks to adventures liberally around your world. __Each location prepared should have at least one hook to another location__.

 * __Reason__: Doing this will create a web of relationships that make your game world come to life. This will make it easier for players to create their own objectives within the world.

## 5. Factions should have a goal, an obstacle, and a plan to overcome that obstacle.

 * __Reason__: This hits the sweet spot for prepping just enough to have great utility while not over prepping a faction in case your group never interacts with them.

 * Idea from [this GFC DND video](https://youtu.be/-ORbIu5C5UM). All the videos on that channel are well worth watching by the way.


# Dungeon Design

## 1. Follow a Dungeon Checklist for stocking your dungeon
 1. Something to talk to
 2. Multiple routes and branches to explore
 3. Environments that can be altered
 4. Something to kill you
 5. Something to slay
 6. Treasure to take
 7. Something to experiment with
 8. Something hidden


 * Original idea from [Goblin Punch's blog post](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/01/dungeon-checklist.html?m=1)

## 2. Leave hints about other locations within the dungeon

 * __Reason__: This lets the players make intelligent decisions about how they are going to approach exploring the dungeon. You want players to think things like, ""should we follow these scratches or head the other way?"".

## 3. Make sure there are no bland swinging-bags-of-HP style encounters

 * __Reason__: Fights where the players and enemies alternate rolling without making a decision more meaningful than ""I roll to hit the monster"" are boring and undesirable. Don't do this, I'll explain more further down.

# Combat Encounters

## 1. Combats are best kept short and sweet

 * __Reason__: The interesting decisions in a fight tend to be made early in the fight. Once the interesting choices have been made (e.g. PCs/enemies utilizing the environments for an upper hand) then the combat should be nearing a close. 
 * __Roll for morale!__ Your enemies shouldn't want to die. 

## 2. Dynamic environments, enemy tactics, or secondary objectives add a good layer of complexity to what could be an otherwise bland fight.

 * __Environment Example__: Environments that have high potential energy are ideal. Locations that contain a cliff on a battle field, or the threat of a falling rocks trap provide the players/enemies an environmental means of gaining an upper hand.

 * __Enemy Tactics__: A goblin gang might jump the PCs then try to get the players to chase them into an ambush; a team of orcs might target and try to kidnap the smallest member of the party. The point is the enemies have a goal beyond take turns rolling dice until they are dead.

 * __Secondary Objectives__: Objectives like ""take that wand from the Kobold Shaman"", or ""protect the prisoner from getting recaptured"" are worth adding on occasion.
 
 * Don't go overboard with this, but do keep it in mind.

# Running the Dungeon

## 1. State room descriptions in this order: Dimension & Exits, Monsters, then Details.

 * __Reason__: Dimensions and exits of the room first so the players have a sense of space and the mapper can write it down. Describe sensory details of the monsters seen, preferring to avoid stating its name outright. Then describe key details of the room. Use cardinal directions frequently where appropriate.
 
   * Having a standard order for narration helps hit all the important details of a room consistently.

## 2. When moving, count off feet (or squares) moved in a cardinal direction

 * __Example__: ""You move west down the hallway 5ft, 10ft, 15ft—you are standing in the middle of a T intersection with the halls continuing north or south. What do you do?""

 * __Reason__: This makes life easier for you and the mapper. They will be able to more accurately map, and tracking turns used in movement becomes much simpler.

## 3. Frequently restate the current situation and where the players are located.

 * __Reason__: Restating frequently helps keep players from losing their sense of space and surroundings so everyone can stay on the same page. This is especially important to do when entering new rooms/chambers. E.g. are the players standing at the entrance to the room? Or have they entered and are standing in the middle?

# Miscellaneous Things I Recommend

## 1. Use a caller

 * A caller is the player who is designated to state what all the player characters do in a dungeon turn. Other players can of course correct the caller should they misspeak.

 * __Reason__: Structuring conversation through a caller keeps turns organized much better than resolving things as players state what they want to do directly at you, the GM. This might sound unappealing at first, but it works remarkably well for keeping the game moving. Players talk among themselves, and ask questions to you about what they plan on doing. The turn only gets resolved when the caller is done stating what actions are being taken this turn.

## 2. Roll as little as possible

 * __Reason__: Never roll for things that you expect the PCs to be able to do. Unless there is some significant risk (e.g. hp loss) or reason they might fail, then the players should succeed with most things by default no dice being rolled.

## 3. Roll ^almost everything in the open

 * __Reason__: Doing this has numerous positive effects on the table. For starters, it prevents you from cheating your players as a crutch by showing them the consequences of their actions. Enemies won't pull their punches. As a knock on effect (in my experience at least), players see the dice as an antagonist instead of the GM. Even more, rolling in the open has fostered better cooperation between players and the GM at all the tables I have been at.

 * Secret rolls can be kept secret.

## 4. Utilize Procedures

 * __Reason__: Organization of play is key to keeping a steady and enjoyable pace to the game. It's a lot harder to get derailed with it than without it.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1296e0890>,osr,1672213334.0

Discovering OSR ruined other RPG playstyles for me,"I have a background of about 7 years DMing 5e, but also World of Darkness games, Powered by the Apocalypse-like games etc. As a GM, I've basically struggled from the start, and often my struggles relate to adventure design, specifically making an interesting plot and designing a line through the adventure while leaving enough space and tools to play with to allow for player freedom. My plots never felt interesting, getting players to follow them was a pain (""my character is not interested in that"") and getting ""off the rails"" has always been scary for me, not because I'm afraid of improvising, but because once there's rails, that becomes constraining for that improvisation. And the fear of characters dying, both from players because they are very attached, and from me as it can derail the adventure. 

Discovering the OSR, it just feels more right. No grand plot but an interesting world to explore, from which a story evolves. Players being challenged themselves to be genuinely creative and resourceful and death isn't a nuisance that threatens the end the campaign, it's part of the design. A more player-driven outlook, so no more needing to convince players or characters to go on an adventure.  Admittedly these aspects might not be exclusive to OSR but the point stands. 

Knowing that this way of playing exists, makes it even more draining to prep for other games, and playing in such games can be frustrating. Knowing death isn't really on the table because nobody wants the campaign to end, just suddenly makes everything feel pointless? I don't want to meta game but when the GM clearly prepared a certain plot or adventure line, I can't help but be aware of that fact and have it influence my actions. I can't help but feel like, despite there being freedom within the boundaries of the adventure, there's still a fairly clear limit to freedom, and there's a rebellious side in me that finds that knowledge frustrating, like I'm forced to dance to someone elses tune. 

All of this frankly makes me feel a little alienated from the community at large, because this way of playing is massively popular (mostly due to 5e's success). All my friends play that way and like it, but as I've gotten frustrated with the playstyle, I feel less enjoyment playing or running those games. I wish I could fully share their enjoyment as I once did, because in the end that's the most valuable thing this hobby has given me. 

Does anyone relate to this experience?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x129776720>,osr,1724017145.0
Free art!,"Hey folks -

Rules
Book 1 - Bestiary and Encounters
Book 2 - Areas and NPCs 
Book 3- Campaign Journal and Notebook (basic world building and lore, the rest blank)

This community is really nice. Thanks everyone.,"First, a shoutout to the mods for doing a bang up job. Really, appreciated,

Second, kudos to the community. 20k plus and filled with cool content, interesting ideas, and dynamic discussions. Thank you.

After the rise of G+ ate a lot of the blogger scene, and the fall of G+ then scattered the OSR to the eight winds, it’s really cool to see this subreddit coalesce. Better for discussions than Twitter, searchable, and I won’t say a thing about metabook (nice folks there, but the FB algo and company just wrecks it for me). I was apprehensive about Reddit initially, but r/osr has been changing my mind.

So, thank you.

And, now, a throwback.

"Hexcrawls and ""density of content""","Hello guys!
So lately I've decided to get another group to run the game for besides the current group I run.
In the old group I'm running a module called ""Scourge of the Northland"".
For the new group, I'm setting the game in the same world, but in another region. For them I'll be running B2 Keep on the Borderlands.
While trying to make an hexmap for this new group I came across some difficulty with populating hexes.
I spread out some stuff from B2 and added some stuff of my own to the south. So I think that part is decently populated. But I had to make the rest of the hexmap myself (because I wanted it to match SotN's map in size somewhat closely). 
Now I'm faced with some difficulty deciding where to place things.
I have:
- awakened undead crypt
- Dwarven city
- Human and dwarf town
- wizard's tower
- dangerous pass that can be used to enter Northland

But things still feel somewhat empty.
I've tried to make up some rumors to incentivise the players to explore but it still doesn't really feel like it's enough.
Should I just roll for them to get lost and when they wander into another hex I check if I there's a feature there? 
If so should I generate an actual location with things to do or simply ""something interesting"" (like Instead of a village or a camp, just and old runestone or something)? Couldn't that lead to an overtly saturated map?

I want things to feel distant from each other and that making a trip requires preparation. But not so distant as to have everything feel isolated.

Here is the current map for reference.
(Sorry for poor quality).
The northern part is made by me and the southern part is an adaptation of the B2 map.

"B/X is so intuitive, I don't have to really ""prep"" anymore session to session.  ","To be clear, it was a lot of work before the game started.  I run Jacob Fleming's OSE modules with two groups on roll20, and before the first sessions I  uploaded all the maps (world, dungeon, and some wilderness encounters), as well as monster and npc tokens I would maybe need for several sessions. 

But now all I have to do is just roll encounters before a game.  It's all up to the players entirely on where to go and what to do.  I get to use my brain power during the session to run monsters during encounters and describe what's happening.  

No more laying down ""track"" of where players can go or trying to predict their movements.  Oh, you want to abandon the town under siege and go off into the mountains to go hunting?  Sure, you have the rations?  

No more fretting over balanced encounters.  Players  (mostly) approach the world and encounters with extreme caution because characters can actually die. I get to just enjoy listening to them strategize on what to do.  

No more DC nonsense. Roll under for an ability or over for a save.  Me and the players just decide when it's necessary, and often times it isnt unless its stated.  

Dungeon and wilderness exploration is guided by clear cut procedures. 

Combat procedures, in particular, ensure encounters are strategic and dramatic. No three hour slogs.  Characters die, but nothing ever seems unfair or contrived.  

No more thinking of mission hooks.  At first it was gold the players were after to level up, but over time the players, not me, built the story based on their actions.  Treasure is still a top priority, though.  

At the end of a session all I do is make a couple of notes on how the players actions may influence the world, record some of their ideas about what they think is happening and then, before next session roll up a few more encounters.  

I know this whole new dnd book is releasing this month, but I loathe the idea of having to go back and building the game while I'm driving it.  

After a year and half of play on my last 5e campaign I was totally burnt out and frustrated.  After a year and half of play on my OSE campaigns (plural) we are going strong and can't wait for the next session.  

I know I'm preaching to the choir with this but dang, coming B/X OSE was the best decision I ever made in the hobby.   It is a truly remarkable ttrpg system.

It was the default setting for the BECMI Boxed sets and made it's debut in the old Isle of Dread module and grew from there to become one of the biggest, and most fleshed out settings in the history of D&D. 

Each book is a different nation and gives you anything you want to set up a campaign. Whether it's Dwarves, Elves, Halflings, Vikings, or Orcs Mystara has something for everyone. Add to that the Hollow World stuff and you literally have two worlds in one. 

Its one of the coolest things (imo) TSR did back in the day and I really can't recommend it enough. Each of the books are available as pdf or pod on drivethrurpg. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x129f175f0>,osr,1724382123.0

Why anyone told me about Cairn before?,"Man, I wish someone had told me about Cairn two years ago when I was still grinding through 5E. Like, where was this game when I was flipping through spell lists and juggling ability modifiers? It’s just so clean—no fuss, no bloat, just straight to the good stuff.

The way it handles characters, exploration, and danger is exactly what I didn’t know I was looking for back then. No rigid classes, just who you are and what you carry. And the game actually trusts you to be creative instead of boxing you into a list of pre-approved actions. It’s wild how much freedom it gives without ever feeling loose or undefined.

If I had known about Cairn back then, I probably would’ve spent way less time stressing over mechanics and way more time actually playing.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x129f5a390>,osr,1741654480.0
Grimtooth's Traps,"Found this at a thrift store today and immediately remembered the kid who DM'd my middle school group had it (and the first book). I grabbed it for nostalgia's sake, but a few of the traps had me laughing, they're so hilariously mean snd brutal. Which means...I'll need to use them in future games!

I see that there have been both DCC and 5E hardcover reprints - anyone know if the reprints include the original illustrations rather than updated art?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x129f644d0>,osr,1734643878.0
