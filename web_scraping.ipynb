      "I have been enjoying Earth for some time and I was thinking about some potential changes to rules in order to enhance some aspects, in particular interactivity with other players. The abundance introduces some elements of interactivity but still limited to some extent to my opinion. moreover thinking about games like 7wonders where some actions may disrupt other player's plans.\n",

      "  \n",
      "Here's my thoughts and open for feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) when taking one of the 4 actions (plant, compost, water, grow) i would consider an alternative action, that could be chosen instead of the standard one, using the seeds mechanics. (picture below)\n",
      "\n",
      "a) **spend one seed: plant one card on the board from your hand and the second from one of the neighbors hand**. since there are a lot of common objectives (fauna or ecosystem), my opponent may have cards that can be useful to me. by stealing that card from their hand i can fulfill my plans and disrupt others\n",
      "\n",
      "b) s**pend one seed: add 2 soil and add to my hand one card from the personal compost of another player.** if another player has a personal compost deck with lots of cards this will enhance the possibility to find a card I need. moreover, since composting deck are built with a mix of discarded cards from hand and picked from the main deck, I still have some unknown element when searching an opponent personal compost.\n",
      "\n",
      "c) **spend one seed: take two sprouts out of an opponent board and put them on my board**. \n",
      "\n",
      "d) **spend one seed: grow 2 and take one card from a neighbor hand**. similar advantages to case a), but i will keep the card in my hand instead of planting it. maybe I will never plant it but if it's a card that may give advantages to the opponent i may disrupt their plan \n",
      "\n",
      "https://preview.redd.it/q3yevd16paoe1.jpg?width=1058&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33b3eced29816ea2dcdffce89c65a592fa8dab03\n",
      "\n",
      "2) this second variation alters the mechanic a bit more, so still thinking if it makes sense.  I often see no rationale in the choice I make in laying sprouts (the green cubes I earn) on the board. the only reason driving the choice is to leave space for any potential adjacency rules, but for the rest of the time I use to lay them down casually. to introduce a logic I was thinking of this additional rule. \"*you can only grow plants on a card if you have at least one sprout on that card*\" in the rare cases a card has grow space only (e.g. Tulips) i can grow the plant without any cube, but if the card has both (most of the cases) i cannot grow there if i do not have at least one sprout. thematically speaking it would make sense, because i cannot think growing a plant before it even started making its little sprouts out of the ground. Additionally, consider this \"*if for any reason  the sprouts on the cards are removed, any plant grown on that card needs to be removed*\" this may interact well with the interactive action c) above, so i can take out green cubes from an opponent on a card where there is a grown plant, and wipe out also the grown plant, affecting the opponent points to a significant extent.\n",
