I wrote about how Citadel Miniatures used to make Dungeons and Dragons adventurer miniatures in packs of three where the model changed as the adventurer level increased,"So back in the early days of Games Workshop they did a lot of work with TSR, the then owners of Dungeons and Dragons. One of the join ventures, as well at the European distriobutution rights for D&D, was some licenced minatures for D&D play. These came out in 1985 and White Dwarf magazine issue 63 announced them; ""Citadel will be manufacturing the official D&D and AD&D miniatures....""",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x121888d10>,osr,1742251426.0

A treasure hoard of ancient minis,"A friend from my Viking reenactment group gave me her late husband’s D&D minis from back in the day. This little tub must weigh 20 pounds and is stuffed full of Grenadier and Ral Partha lead from the 70’s and 80’s. Fighting Men, nude slave women, clerics with crucifixes, pig-faced orcs—this is pure grognard energy!

It was especially meaningful because her husband was really into D&D, and she didn’t want these minis just sitting around the house not being enjoyed by anyone.

Couple questions: 1) These are pure lead. Knowing what we know now, would people feel comfortable gaming with any pieces that I wash and fully paint? And 2) How fugging sick is that Deathdealer mini, huh?! I nearly lost it when I unearthed that one.

For real, though…any safety advice for bringing some of them back into service?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x121996240>,osr,1742185018.0

"OSR News Roundup for March 17th, 2025","Welcome to the third OSR News Roundup of March. This is the week that GaryCon kicks off, so people are plenty busy getting ready for that. The big news this week is the currently funding Shadowdark Kickstarter, shattering stretch goals with their [**Western Reaches campaign**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shadowdarkrpg/western-reaches), an exciting setting and game expansion.

* [**In Ruins**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mallenhall/in-ruins-a-dungeon-building-game) is a fun-looking dungeon building game that is currently funding on Kickstarter. It's a neat concept; the player's build a castle, let it fall into ruin, and then populate it with monsters who all fight for control of the Throne Room.
* Written for Wretched & Alone, [**Covet** ](https://clrex4.itch.io/covet)is a solo-rpg all about obsession, desire, and toxic relationships.
* We carry a couple of titles by Hatchlings Games, and they're currently raising funds for [**GAST**](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/hatchlings/gast-horror-zine-collection-publishing-startup) on Backerkit, a boxset collection of short horror games.
* Another project funding on Backerkit is [**Hit the Road Jack**](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/rv-games/hit-the-road-jack), a solo or duet game of high-speed, highway chases on the open road.
* Ward Against Evil has just released [**Aketon: Adventurer Options**](https://ward-against-evil.itch.io/aketon-adventurer-options), a supplement for the Aketon rpg. It's free, and even if you don't play Aketon there's bound to be plenty of inspirational material within.
* [**Harpy Broodmother**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/515213/harpy-broodmother-osr?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473) is a free adventure written for Knave 2e, OSE, Mork Borg, and Shadowdark. It's a short adventure, available in pdf only, but the pdf is set up as printable files, as well.
* Matt Finch recently launched his own publishing imprint, Mythmere Games, and has been releasing a steady stream of new and revised titles under it. I'm a huge fan of his *Tome of Adventure Design*, and was super excited to see that two of his most recently Kickstarted titles -- [**The Nomicon** ](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/514044/the-nomicon?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473)and [**Tome of Worldbuilding**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/513972/tome-of-worldbuilding?src=hottest&affiliate_id=253473) are in stock at Drivethrurpg. I hopefully will be conducting an interview with Matt about the upcoming OSRIC revision in the next few weeks, once he's back from GaryCon.
* Knight Owl Publishing has just released [**The Book of New Gods**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/515272/the-book-of-new-gods?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473), a collection of one hundred new gods for use with Shadowdark. Knight Owl consistently produces quality products, and they've got Amanda Lee Franck and Waclaw Traier provided art for the book.
* [**Titan's Throne: Infested Archives**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/514759/titan-s-throne-infested-archives?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473) is a new adventure written for Old School Essentials. It's a sandbox adventure designed for PCs of levels 1-3 and includes a 3-level dungeon the mini-campaign is centered on.
* I've mentioned [**The Ruins of Castle Gygar**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/510225/the-ruins-of-castle-gygar?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473) a couple of times in the past, and the adventure is now live on Drivethru in pdf form. It's a megadungeon written for OSE that was generated as part of the Dungeon23 megadungeon project.
* Another project birthed from Dungeon23 is [**The Blades of Gixa**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ultraparadiso/blades-of-gixa), currently funding on Kickstarter. It's a gorgeous mega-dungeon with a charming layout, like one you'd scribble in your notebooks during high school math.
* [**The Extraplanar Vending Machine**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/515081/the-extraplanar-vending-machine?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473) is a short and sweet system neutral absurd addition to any fantasy rpg. It's very clever, I think.
* Another system neutral little product is [**The Willow's Tears**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/514967/the-willow-s-tears-a-system-neutral-adventure-setting?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473), a short, low-level adventure designed as an introduction. It's got a great map, and I also like how it is set up to be printed as a trifold pamplet.
* Another game I mentioned awhile back is [**Mythic Bastionland**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/514996/mythic-bastionland?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473), the system by well-known author Chris McDowall that is designed as a prologue to their Into the Odd and Electric Bastionland.
* Lixu has released [**Appendix L: Vol. 3**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/514767/appendix-l-3-fane-of-the-laruleans?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473), a collection of material and houserules for Old School Essentials. You may know Lixu for their Spelljammer and Dark Sun adaptions to OSE.
* My own Kickstarter for [**Populated Hexes Monthly Issue 44**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thirdkingdom/populated-hexes-monthly-issue-44-beyond-level-limits) ends on Tuesday. In addition to beginning a look at the kingdom of Negrorn, ruled by seven lich-lords, it also provides rules and guidelines for advancing beyond normal OSE level limits.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x121798920>,osr,1742209235.0

On LotFP and genre,"I see here a fairly frequent assertion on this sub that LotFP is extreme horror akin to Martyrs or Terrifier. Which is absolutely the genre of its full color core book art, and seems to be the objective. But I don't think it's more image sparse black and white adventures really fall into that genre, because the whole genre of extremity requires a level of detail that the books' writing does not support, so when we without full color art it falls short of this genre aim. Primarily texture extreme horror requires more descriptive writing than most LotFP books have, and generally more space than most OSR adventures have room for. The main books I'm thinking of as comparison points are Stokoe's Cows and LaRocca's Things HaveGotten Worse Since We Last Spoke.

What I think LotFP adventures fall into more and why there is a divisive reaction to them is the hopeless and pointless nature of the horrible things rather than the extremity. More akin to the Descent, the Poughkeepsie Tapes, or the Smiles series than the grindhouse its art seeks to imitate. I personally think most (though not all) LotFP adventures miss the mark on what makes to of those three examples good and falls more into Smile territory, where the consequences are less of a ""how horrifying"" and more of a ""whomp whomp, anyways roll up new dudes"".

Sorry if all of this is obvious or dumb sounding. Just a feeling I had to get off my chest.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1219b12e0>,osr,1742234378.0

In defense of Keep on The Borderlands (and also a defense of Humanoid enemies),"I came across a thread a few weeks ago and I’ve been ruminating on my thoughts for a while. The thread is locked so I couldn’t reply right then and there and I’m not sure where I even saw it or who this response is to but oh well, here I am.

 The main gist was “why run keep on the borderlands? It’s boring, none of the enemies are interesting and they don’t even name any of the NPC’s.” Other people replied but no answer was sufficient (in my or the OP’s opinion.) 
I believe that KOTB is the perfect module to get someone to DM. That was the main purpose in the first place. The area is quite large with a lot of interesting little areas and room for the DM to flex their creativity. It leaves quite a bit open to slot into any campaign.

Aside from the faction play that really makes the caves of chaos so fun, having humanoids be the first real enemies allows both the players and the DM to understand the motives, tactics and mindset of what you are fighting. Big pig face dude and sneaky little boys are much easier for someone new to both TTRPGs and fantasy as a whole to understand than say, a gibbering mouther or xorn. 

We’ve had decades upon decades of iterations on ttrpgs, lots of new creations and creativity on the scene and we are in an absolute deluge of new options. Why complain about the origins of the hobby?That’s where most of this started for a metric butt ton of people. Of course it’s tropey. It created the tropes! 

I guess I’m going to end this with a question. Other than time constraints, why does it seem like there are a lot of people who don’t understand that this is a game of imagination? Why are some people seemingly allergic to deviating from the books and making it their own? (And just to add some inflammatory statements, this question also goes for the Hispanic coded Orcs in the 5e art. If you don’t like it, don’t add it. You aren’t beholden to the creator’s vision because once the book is yours, it’s your book. You’re the creator now.)

EDIT: I’m not sure if it was even in this sub. It may have been in r/rpg. All I know is that it popped into my feed and I don’t have the knowledge or resources to find it again. But yes, there are people who don’t like kotb.

SECOND EDIT: sorry about the lack of paragraphs. I’m new to this and still trying to figure out how to post on mobile :)",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x121a05ca0>,osr,1742137222.0
Just discovered AS&SS of Hyperborea and holllleee smokes is it awesome!,"Edit: not two S's, my B! 

I had no idea a gem like this existed! I made a post about being out of the loop yesterday and my god i guess i really was. This game is so cool! Im running a bronze age campaign using DCC. I really wanted to migrate to OSRIC, but now? I'm just gonna run this RAW haha it's so stupidly good to read. 

That said, are there any pitfalls that I should expect going into this? Im familiar with thac0/the matrix as I ran a lot of 2e and 1e. From what im reading it seems fairly in your face and a game to just roll with the punches. 

I guess any funky mechanics I may run into that you guys took some time to digest since I want to run it for my table next week.

Suggestion for a monster,"I'm working on a library room complex for the second floor of my haunted house megadungeon and want an ominous librarian that stands unmoving at the circulation desk until someone talks too loud, when it suddenly attacks, but I'm not sure what monster to use for it.  Does anyone have any 1e or OSR monsters they would suggest? I thought about using a Huecuva or a Quizmaster from Found Folio, but just using another undead seems a bit predictable.  I would like something that can cast silence for the thematic connection, but I haven't found any and that might be too overpowered for that level of the dungeon anyway.

Names are divided into chapters by either their intended use (e.g. divine names) or how they sound like (e.g. Anglish or Nörslik). The latter are based on how real-world names sound like but do not replicate them entirely (for historical names I recommend [Treasury of Archaic Names](https://www.acaeum.com/jg/OtherCompanies/RPGRealmTreasuryArchaicNames.html) and [The Everyone Everywhere List](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/89285/the-everyone-everywhere-list?affiliate_id=2150725)).

Wolves Upon the Coast Session 2,"I recently started running *Wolves Upon the Coast*, and it’s one of the best RPG products I’ve encountered. This blog series is my way of documenting the experience—both to share insights and to help others discover this incredible campaign.

**Previous entries:**

* [Intro](https://www.sqyre.app/blog/wolves-intro)
* [Session 1 Summary](https://www.sqyre.app/blog/wolves-session-one)
* [Foundry setup](https://www.sqyre.app/blog/wolves-foundry)

**Session 2: The Wolves Make Landfall**

*Days:* 3-7 (player-facing)

*Dates:* 4/2-4/6 (GM-only info for tracking seasons and holidays)

**The Wolves**

* **Arnsteinn** – Speaks Ruis, Brythonic, and Pictish.
* **Erik the Younger** – Speaks Brythonic and Pictish.
* **Gorm** – Originally named Coram O'Dorbog, renamed ""Gorm"" by the Pictish master. Speaks Ruis, Brythonic, and Pictish.
* **Iago** – Speaks Pictish.

**The Journey Continues**

As the excitement of Gorm’s boast to return with the head of the gryphon faded, the Wolves began to plan how they might overcome such a dangerous foe. Asking around, they learned that the nearby hamlet of Cloyne was devoted to the Old Ways of the druids — perhaps its people knew something about poisons? They set sail across the bay, arriving at the hamlet to find it populated mostly by children and the elderly, as the adults were at sea fishing.

The old folk were suspicious of the strangers, but assurances of peaceful intent — and the promise that most of the Wolves would remain on the karvi — won them permission to approach. The villagers offered hospitality in exchange for help with chores and minor repairs while they awaited the return of their headman. Iago, outed as a Christian, was exiled from the hamlet and stayed with the men on the boat. The Wolves were rewarded with a meal of unpleasant fish and turnip stew. Gorm threw out his back helping repair a roof but found comfort in the arms of a friendly young woman who soon made him forget his pains.

When the adults returned at day’s end, they met Beyf, the taciturn headman. The old folk vouched for the Wolves, and after some negotiation, Beyf agreed to lead them to the local druid in exchange for 100 silver from the gryphon's reward. The next morning, in heavy rain, they set out for the druid’s craggy peninsula.

The druid was a sight: skin and bones wrapped in feathered jewelry and a makeshift feather skirt barely covering his ass. He listened to their tale and, for payment, offered to brew a sleeping draught that could be applied to the beast’s skin to put it to sleep — but only if they returned with a feather from the gryphon as part of the bargain. The Wolves agreed and made the muddy return journey to Cloyne.

The next day, rain still falling, the Wolves split up. Iago remained on the karvi, regaling the crew with dreams of founding Iagotown, where all men would be free. Arnsteinn returned to Culemwardern for supplies, securing large fish hooks and damaged nets that might work on a creature the size of a gryphon. Erik and Gorm braved the rain to fetch the sleeping draught from the druid.

Day Six brought fog, making the journey to Shoal — an island known for treacherous waters — too dangerous. The Wolves hunkered down and counted themselves lucky to no longer be thralls. The plan was set: they would sail to Shoal, bait the gryphon with Erik’s donkey, and dose the beast with the sleeping draught.

Day Seven dawned clear and warm. As they left the bay, another ship approached from the southwest, flying a red sword on a black background. The captain, a large red-bearded man, warned them away from Shoal. He introduced himself as Raghall the Red, a free captain from the city of Guthram across the channel in Albann, and invited the Wolves to join him and Queen Dar in the free city. The Wolves thanked him but made no promises, pressing on toward Shoal.

Shoal loomed ahead — a towering spear of rock rising from a turbulent sea. The Wolves circumnavigated the island, searching for a landing spot. They managed to beach the karvi and haul the donkey halfway up the rocky slopes before the terrain became too steep. As the gryphon returned to its roost, they doused the donkey with the sleeping draught. Their own shouting was drowned out by wind and waves, but prodding the donkey made it bray loud enough to draw the gryphon’s attention.

With a bloodcurdling shriek, the beast launched from the pinnacle — a true monster: crocodile head, wolf forelimbs, lion hindlegs, and eagle’s wings.

The session ended on a cliffhanger as battle was about to be joined!

**GM Thoughts on Session 2**

*General*

I was really happy with how much happened, even in our shorter Foundry sessions. The combination of the density of the *Wolves* sandbox and the light rules meant we were able to fly through scenes.

*Random Encounters*

As an old-school sandbox, *Wolves* has a robust set of random encounters for land and naval regions. I've been pre-rolling weather, wind, and encounters, which helps keep the game flowing instead of figuring things out on the fly.

*Reaction Rolls*

*Wolves* uses a common old-school mechanic, the **reaction roll**, to determine the disposition of NPCs. Roll 2d6 — high results are friendly, low results hostile. I used reaction rolls liberally for the villagers, Beyf, and the druid. The dice were in the Wolves’ favor, making for a smoother journey — a trend that’s continued across several sessions.

*Saves vs. Tests*

*Wolves* has two mechanics for non-combat rolls: **Saves** and **Attribute Tests**. Climbing Shoal raised the question of which to use. In the spirit of **Rulings over Rules**, I ruled that since we'd started with Saves, we'd use them for the rest of the session and discuss the approach between sessions.

*Gryphon Design*

Luke Gearing’s *Wolves* bestiary takes familiar monsters and makes them weird. I was tempted to use his gryphon but decided to roll on tables from *The Monster Overhaul* by Skerples, which produced the crocodile-headed abomination. I want *Wolves* to push me out of my vanilla fantasy habits, and this weird hybrid was a perfect fit. Check it out on DTRPG [The Monster Overhaul](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/421868/the-monster-overhaul).

Next up I'll recap Session 3 which was the Wolves' battle with the Gryphon, a perilous climb, and reflections on player agency, rule adjudication, and game pacing.

Until then, good fortune in the wars to come!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x121a269f0>,osr,1742134283.0

I've written up the [full details of the 'supply die'](https://murkdice.substack.com/p/the-supply-die), but in short: it's a step dice chain that can generate supply complications either as it depletes or when it runs out, which are then handled in an NSR-y/FKR-y manner.

Dark & Darker - a video game you can check if you need to scratch that itch,"I've recently come across this game called **Dark and Darker** and gave it a go when I wanted to play video game with old-school dungeon delving theme. 

You basically choose a class, get your starting gear and delve into a dungeon you explore and loot. You keep a map of the dungeon of areas you visit, you have a torch and all that jazz, and chests which you can check in, merchants, etc.  

I've raided (unsuccessfully and died) a Goblin Cave by myself --but it supports co-op so that's also possible. It's free-to-play for now so no harm in trying, if you're looking for something to scratch that itch. It's still in early access so beware.

First impression is that it can be a good way to get your dose, when you cannot play tabletop.

You can get the game for free on Steam - https://www.darkanddarker.com/

Priory of the Sunstruck - Adventure Hooks,"So continuing my push to keep myself writing by making myself publicly accountable. This week I did some more work polishing some key rooms in the module I am taking from DM binder notes to written page.

It is a longer post, detailing 2 rooms but the particular thought I wanted to share is pulled out from the rest of the post in the excerpt below:

""Another aside - I am really having an internal debate about the role of hooks in an adventure. I know the classic ""TSR"" style is to have a bunch of hooks to be rolled randomly at the beginning of the adventure. It feels like a quantity over quality approach though. If I'm going to write a module and then put it out into the world for someone else to drop into their game then shouldn't I give 1 or 2 really solid hooks that are sure to catch their player's attention? And to me, a great hook has to HAVE A PAYOFF. Don't do fake hooks. Don't do generic hooks. Don't do hooks if the players bite they are underwhelming. Yay, gold! Who cares, wherever they go there will be gold. That's the point of the game.

GIVE THEM A MAGIC SWORD! If you give them a magic sword, the next time you throw a hook their way you know what they are going to do? They are going to bite. Every. Single. Time. Just keep giving them swords.

But you know what, I didn't just give them a sword. I gave them an NPC to interact with. I gave them an enemy - the Duke wants that sword. I gave them a choice, what can they get in return if they give the sword back to the Duke? I gave them questions. Who is this duke? Is he a good guy? It's a whole story that can be explored. At minimum its a new entry on the wandering monster table where occasionally some hired thugs from this random Duke somewhere else in the world show up and try to take the sword. Maybe the Peacock Blade wants to go back? Maybe Duke and Peacock Blade are in love?""

The rest of the post is here, but tell me - what are your thoughts about Hooks?

System for content unlocking,"I’m going to run an OSE game starting with the Classic rules.

It’s going to be a status quo hex-crawl n a dungeon strewn wilderness, death trap type game where characters will die frequently.

Triggers for unlocking could be discoveries, leveling, or forming alliances.  Sources for the new content would be Advanced OSE, Carcass Crawler, and homebrew/internet.

Do you let the creator of a game influence whether or not you play/support it?,"I am an OD&D nerd and have enjoyed the recent publication from Wizards of the Coast about the original game. That sent me down a rabbit hole of retro-clones, I think they’re called. 

Al’Qadim was always my favorite 2nd Edition setting, so I was drawn to this obscure game I found called Seven Voyages of Zylarthen that is more swords and sandals than European fantasy. It reads like OD&D but, frankly, better in many respects. got some glowing reviews so I snagged it.

Yeah, it’s utterly brilliant. 

Unfortunately, I also found out in my wanderings that the creator is explicitly Islamophobic, or at least was when he was blogging many years ago. Seems like he has left the hobby. 

I want to champion a masterpiece of a game but struggle to separate art from artist, despite enjoying a game made by people as flawed and of their time as I certainly am in 2025. I also don’t want to attract the wrong kinds of people if I advertise games for it.

I was thinking of adding a similar mechanic to my game and wanted to get some feedback.  The rule would be this:  This could apply to Both Fighters and Paladins.  Each round the player would declare their mighty deed, much like in DCC,  If the player rolled a natural 18 or higher and hit the opponent the the deed would be successful.  I know when we played our short lived DCC campaign that was one of the mechanics that the players really liked.   What do you think of introducing this?  Does the way I have it laid out work?  I am trying to not use additional dice, like in DCC. should I incorporate the 1d4 as a random modifier instead of fixed modifier and if it hits on a 4 (level 1) the mighty deed hits.

It seems the early D&D sets that contained dice were predominantly single-coloured, and the blister packs sold separately for dragon dice wouldn’t have been bagged, and would have been accompanied by a crayon/pencil.

Where Should I Start with OSR for Very New Players?,"I'm thinking about starting an OSR campaign with some VERY new players.

I was considering running a Dolmenwood campaign, maybe starting with Winter’s Daughter or The Black Wyrm of Brandonsford.

The problem is, I don’t know where to find a comprehensive guide to Dolmenwood, and I’m unsure which system would be best. I first learned about OSR around six months ago when I discovered Old-School Essentials, but I’ve also heard about Shadowdark and Cairn.

Given that my players are completely new, where should I start? What system would be best for easing them into OSR-style play? Also, any recommendations on Dolmenwood resources?

Mass combat events in OSR setting,"Hi,

i'm playing Hot springs island using Dragonbane. This is an OSR setting about multiple factions wanting different things and the players characters come in the middle and basically alter the status quo.

There are some random events that might involve battles between factions, and some battles can have a large number of participants (up to 50). I'm looking for a way to manage that **without standard initiative-based combat** (which the characters wouldn't survive) but still allow some decisionmaking and interesting results for the players.

I was considering implementing ad-hoc moves like pbta, but i'm having a hard time since in normal encounters the characters already have their hands full with one or two enemies, and it would stretch credibility to have good rolls solve too much. Plus, they are not commanding anything right so it's not they can order other warriors arounds.

**Are there any easy, narrative but still character-influenced systems i can bolt on for this?**  
I am imagining something like ""select up to 3 bad things to happen to you in exchange for equivalent number of combat objectives to achieve"" but a little more indepth or nuanced.

Populated Hexes Monthly Issue 44 -- Beyond Level Limits,"There's a little less than a week left to back issue 44 of Populated Hexes Monthly on Kickstarter. This issue, written for Old School Essentials, provides rules and guidelines for advancing characters beyond their level limits (up to a max level of 20 for human characters) that mashes up standard level advancement with the BECMI rules for achieving immortality. It provides a few different options for level gain requirements (straight gold = XP, setting character goals, accumulating mortal worshippers on the path to divinity) that can be combined or used individually, as well as expanded advancement tables.



It also starts a look at the domain of the dead, the kingdom of Negrorn, a silent, frozen land ruled by seven lich-lords.

Academic recourses for studying the OSR?,"Hello everyone!

I'm writing a paper analyzing the OSR as a discourse community. My thesis for the paper is that the OSR as a community encourages freedom both at the table (in its gameplay loop and sandbox nature) and away from it (by inspiring creative material and still being more or less an ""indie"" scene). Throughout the paper, I cite primary sources that display the communities' cultural practices and communication patterns and how they relate to my thesis.

I have a good amount of primary sources, but I'm struggling to find secondary sources. The guidelines for my paper define secondary sources as ""scholarly works or texts written by experts, researchers, or observers who have studied or written about the discourse community."" Does anyone have suggestions for sources that fit this criteria and relate to my thesis? I currently only have *Playing at the World, 2E* by Jon Peterson.

Castle Zagyg Galleries of the Arch Mage now crowdfunding,"[Troll Lord Games](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/86/troll-lord-games?affiliate_id=2150725) just launched a [crowdfunding campaign](https://attronarch.com/crowdfunding-castle-zagyg-galleries-of-the-arch-mage) on [Backerkit](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/troll-lord-games/castle-zagyg-galleries-of-the-arch-mage) for the legendary megadungeon by Gary Gygax:

> **This is the first of two crowdfunding campaigns.** With your help, we hope to return to shelves worldwide Gary Gygax's Castle Zagyg. It is a monstrous project; one with with an incredible legacy!

Most of the content is based on Gary's notes:

> **Who is Writing It?**
> Volume 1, _The Citadel_ is written by Gary Gygax. This is the content some of you have in Yggsburgh, previously published by Troll Lord Games in 2004; it will contain updated art on the cover and interior, plus new maps.
> 
> Volume 2, _The Castle_ is written by Jeffrey Talanian. This originally appeared in Upper Works, published by Troll Lord Games in 2008. It will also feature an updated cover and new interior art, as well as new maps for more seamless play.
> 
> Volume 3, _The Cellars_ includes one level written by Jeffrey Talanian (the 1st). The rest is being written by Michael Stewart. Mike has written and published a number of adventures through Troll Lord Games, and his writing style fits Castle Zagyg perfectly. Couple that with his work on Yggsburgh alongside Gary Gygax, and he is the perfect candidate for the task. He is back on board to pore over Gary's original notes and maps and to create the dungeon that many of us have longed for, and many more never knew they wanted. 

Castle Zagyg will be published for the TLG's [Castles & Crusades system](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/86/troll-lord-games/category/44934/castles-and-crusades-fantasy-roleplaying?affiliate_id=2150725), meaning it is broadly compatible with TSR's D&D editions and other popular retroclones.

Ideas to how Astromancy should work?,"Running Adam Hensley's heavily modified Monoloith right now.

I successfully adjusted most rules that I need but can't wrap my head around astromancy to make it usable by me.

In the book it's more akin to ""Space Magic"" which I'm opposed to because I don't want my setting to be magiteck. Hell, some of the astromancy spells are copies of actual DnD spells.

I do have Psionics already and they work in a a classic way: influence world directly using Power Of The Mind (reminds of Wizards). In practice effects are less flashy than magic could be. So instead of throwing a fireball, Pyrokinetic just combusts a zone and everyone in it. This works for me.

Astromancers should have recieved their abilities from *some cosmic entities,* (should remind clerics and warlocks?) but I have two problems:  
1) How they should work in a different way than Psionics mechanically? In theory they should have less control over more powerful effects but that seems like a bad design.  
2) How effects should look so they don't still seem like ""space magic""? Temporal and space-bending effects are sci-fi enough but are pretty niche.

Clipping lanterns to belts,"For games set in typical medieval fantasy settings, would you allow lanterns to be clipped to a belt or another article of clothing? I think the normal assumption in OSR play is that you need a free hand to wield a light source so I wanted to see how other DMs ruled this.

I can imagine a few reasons why it wouldn't be common to do this IRL (I believe modern lanterns don't suffer these issues, but medieval lanterns might?):

* Being too close to the body could mess with the air intake, dimming the flame
* The heat generated may be too uncomfortable to stay clipped so close to the body for long
* The contents may slosh around too much, potentially accidentally dousing the flame

If none of the above are enough to outright prevent lanterns from being clipped, I would imagine that there's the possibilities that a fall or solid hit in combat could cause the lantern to shatter and the burning oil to damage the wielder",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x121f92c60>,osr,1741722228.0

OSE - THAC0 vs AAC difference??,"In the **Classic: Characters** booklet, there is a short paragraph of the optional use of Ascending AC:

>Note: Using Ascending Armour Class results in very slightly different attack probabilities than when using the traditional approach of descending AC with an attack matrix.

For the love of all that is Holy, somebody please explain to me how THAC0 and Ascending AC can result in different probabilites.

Also, the **Classic: Adventures** booklet says the following about using THAC0 directly (subtracting monster AC from THAC0 and using that as the target to hit with the attack roll):

>Note: Using THAC0 to resolve attack rolls results in very slightly different attack probabilities than when using the traditional approach of referring to the attack matrix.

How? How on Earth would it result in different probabilities?

**Example:**

A 4th level Fighter THAC0: 17 \[+2\] wants to hit a Goblin AC: 6 \[13\]

Using the attack matrix: To hit DAC 6 with a THAC0 of 17, you need to meet or beat 11

Using THAC0 directly: you need to meet or beat THAC0 - DAC = 17 - 6 = 11

Using Ascending AC: To hit AAC 13 with an attack bonus of +2, you need to meet or beat 11

I couldn't find anything that outright said no, and the only hint was that it says movement, or missile attack once in the quick rundown of the phases, but in the longer explanation of the phase it doesn't seem to make it either/or. Since we are all 5e players and a turn is a whole minute I ruled it was OK.

2. If you use a missile attack, can you then use a melee attack? Again I didn't see anything specifying one action per turn, and the only hint is that some missile weapons allow for more than one attack in a turn. I ruled it was okay for now, since a turn is a minute, and it seems very possible for someone to do both in 1 turn if they want.

I know OD&D is rulings over rules and the original white box wasn't very specific itself so in general I made the assumption that it's up to me to decide, but if there is a rule in the book and I didn't find any answers I just went with what was fun for the table.

Thanks for the advice.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x121fd1190>,osr,1741709320.0

Why anyone told me about Cairn before?,"Man, I wish someone had told me about Cairn two years ago when I was still grinding through 5E. Like, where was this game when I was flipping through spell lists and juggling ability modifiers? It’s just so clean—no fuss, no bloat, just straight to the good stuff.

The way it handles characters, exploration, and danger is exactly what I didn’t know I was looking for back then. No rigid classes, just who you are and what you carry. And the game actually trusts you to be creative instead of boxing you into a list of pre-approved actions. It’s wild how much freedom it gives without ever feeling loose or undefined.

If I had known about Cairn back then, I probably would’ve spent way less time stressing over mechanics and way more time actually playing.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x121fe7e90>,osr,1741654480.0

"Rest every 6 turns, where is the interesting choice?","In B/X, PCs have to take a rest of 1 turn every 6 turn or suffering a -1 to save and attack rolls due to exhaustion. Other systems like Cairn, give you a ""fatigue"" slot in your inventory and there must be many others. I think these penalties are nice, you want to consider ways to mitigate them. 

My problem is, basically you always will want to rest. 

Why would you want to press? To push one turn later the 1 in 6 encounter die? It seems very weak to me. There migh be case where spells are active and you don't want to waste turns, but it's very specific and feels clunky.

Rest sounds nice, it give tempo to the dwelve, could bring a bit reflection on the group, like a fire camp at night but I can't think of any situation where the PC would not rest.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1220129f0>,osr,1741685722.0

Advancement in Knave/Knave hacks,"Hi team, I'm an experienced RPG player relatively new to OSR. After running my first few one shots of Knave 1e, I thought it was the perfect system for my latest homebrew RPG project - a game with anthropomorphic woodland animal races and dark fantasy flavours, like Redwall meets a Jim Henson film. I wrote it all up, made my PDF with interim art, created my character sheets and ran my first playtest session with a few friends. 

After running my first sesh (a raccoon had stolen a book of Raise Dead from an ancient wizard's crypt, using skeletons to steal from a nearby village) I had a great time, but encountered a problem. After divvying up all the coin found, each player came out with 166XP, which really didn't seem right - Knave advocates for level up every 1000XP, which seems ages away. 

I may not have put enough loot in there for a level 1 mission, but I'm already thinking of reducing the level caps and adding extra ""do-gooder"" bonuses for milestones reached and NPCs helped along the way. I believe this would foster and reward a sense of community banding together in dark times - a principle theme of a woodland critter game. However, before I go messing with systems I don't understand, why 1K per level? Is it really too high? Thoughts welcome.

"Hey, I have a question: How would you develop the concept of integration between teams?","



I run casual adventures on the AD&D 2e/1e system for four teams of adventurers and I noticed that within 1 discord server a micro community started to grow, recently I was interested in their conversation about ankhegs and whether damp earth conducts electricity and whether it can also conduct paralysis from one of the wands and that it would be cool to test it sometime



Since let's call it team A was in the dungeon and team B in the wild, I agreed that this time it could be done beyond the narrative of giving the created artifact to team B and paying them for the tests





Then the concept of a channel on Discord for exchanging magic items was born for me, which allowed me to stop being afraid that the artifacts that the BG would encounter would be too useless. After 48 sessions and a full year of RPG company, I managed to make 5 such exchanges and 11 orders, 8 of which were completed.

Hex mapping software,"\--SOLVED--  
There's a hex map extension for Inkscape ( [https://github.com/lifelike/hexmapextension](https://github.com/lifelike/hexmapextension) )and although I do have to draw the symbols myself, it's propably the best option at the moment. Simple enough to use, at least, if you're at all familiar with Inkscape (or even Illustrator, thought they do have different workflow and UI, you should pick up Inkscape relatively easily if you know Illustrator (I know I did)).  
I tried it for a moment, and it's easy to snap the symbols to the center of the hex. Now all I have to do is start making the map symbols...

I am looking for a hex mapping software, one that I can download and use from my computer. Worldographer is not the one I want based on the trial version, it feels clumsy and awkward to use with quite the learning curve. Is there any alternatives?  
I'd like to make OSR style maps, so fe. Inkarnate or Wonderdraft are not what I want either. I should just be able to plop map symbols on hex grid. I've made something with Inkscape, but with that I have to center the symbols by hand, not to mention I have to draw them which is not a huge issue, but the need to center the symbols manually is a deal breaker. Might there be some plugins or somethign for Inkscape that does the trick?  
I've been looking around for some time now, and it seems that there isn't a downloadable software that does this simple trick, or am I completely wrong? I would rather not draw them by hand, be it on paper or computer.  
In the meantime, waiting for responses, I'll look into the Inkscape options. I have some idea how to approach, but it might requite a bit of prep.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x12201ef60>,osr,1741683686.0

Was 5e originally considered a triumph for the old school?,"I was watching the interview between Ben Milton and Mike Mearls, and at one point, Ben mentioned that when 5e first launched, the OSR community initially saw it as a victory for their style of play—but over time, that perception soured.  

I wasn’t around the OSR at the time—I only discovered it after 2020—but that idea resonates with me. Even before I became disillusioned with 5e and moved toward OSR games, I remember 5e in 2014 feeling much closer to the experience I wanted. It wasn’t so much the original system that pushed me away, but how both the system and its community evolved over time. A Knight at the Opera [wrote a post that](https://knightattheopera.blogspot.com/2024/10/in-mouth-of-madness.html) really captured my feelings on this shift. Even now, I feel like I'd be happy to run a campaign using *Into the Unknown,* or even 2014 PHB-only with some hacks.  

So, for those who were active in the OSR back in 2014: Does Ben’s description of the community’s reaction sound accurate? If so, did the OSR community ultimately reject 5e because their initial reaction was inaccurate in ways that become more clear over time; or did the game start in a place that mostly aligned with OSR sensibilities before drifting away? Was it just a matter of ""that the gods it's not 4e""?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1220a9eb0>,osr,1741590911.0
"OSR News Roundup for March 10th, 2025","Welcome to the second news roundup of March. My apologies to subscribers; I realized belatedly that I neglected to send out the newsletter last Monday. I had an immensely shitty day and it just got away from me.

I'm getting excited about the upcoming crowdfunding project I'll be launching in April for [**Mind Over Matter**](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/third-kingdom-games/osr-advanced-psionics?preview_token=nbbiRuFK64e), a psionics book for Old School Essentials and other OSR games. In addition to a fairly traditional psionics system, albeit one divorced from point-based activation, it will also include an adaptation of the classic Book of Nine Swords from late in the 3.5-era. I've always liked the concepts presented in that book, and I've reworked the rules to fit in with an OSR mindset and power scaling.

Enough about me, though. The big news from last week that I'm sure many of you have heard already is that Drivethrurpg will be raising prices on certain print on demand products, chiefly softcover books, some of which will see a price increase of up to 70%! I don't know yet how this will affect POD books from other vendors, or offset books from other sources, but it has been my experience that prices almost never *go down*. I hope that people who are in the middle of crowdfunding campaigns aren't negatively affected by the upcoming pricing increases, and for everyone else, I guess now is the time to purchase those POD titles that have been sitting in your cart.

* I've mentioned before my love of the games coming out of Latin America these days, and I was stoked to see that the [**LATAMjam 2025**](https://itch.io/jam/rpg-latam-jam-2025) is starting on March 12th. You don't have to be a LATAM creator to participate, so long as your entry uses a ruleset designed or released by an eligible publisher.

* Matt Kelly has released [**Stormalong**](https://bymattkelly.itch.io/stormalong), a collection of seafaring adventures for Cairn, Into the Odd, and other systems, all based on American folktales.

It's designed as an ""advanced"" companion to Cairn, and is available now for a lower price before it jumps up to the regular price.

Here is a 6 mile hex map of an area of Pangea Ultima. 

[https://timothywestwind.blogspot.com/2025/03/pangea-ultima-central-peninsula-6-mile.html](https://timothywestwind.blogspot.com/2025/03/pangea-ultima-central-peninsula-6-mile.html)

Pangea Ultima is a proposed supercontinent that will form in about 250 million years when the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas merge. It's also known as Pangaea Proxima, Neopangaea, and Pangaea II. 

This map is partly based on an abandoned project (lots of maps for wind directions and climate types) found here: [Civilitatem Resurrectio \~ A Pangea Proxima Worldbuilding Project](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/civilitatem-resurrectio-a-pangea-proxima-worldbuilding-project.486453/page-6) While this area is right in the equator I'm imagining that at some point in the future a now long dead civilisation employed some geo-engineering in order to lower the temperate of the planet by a couple of degrees. In my imagination the climate is somewhere between Tropical and Sub-Tropical even Mediterranean on the coasts. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x121ea0800>,osr,1741563571.0
"I made a one-page (kinda) hack expressly to run Through Ultan's Door titled ""CRIMINAL""","*""\[...\] amongst the city’s less savory elements who frequent the Mercury Whistle—****criminals****, poets, heretics, and thrill-seeking scum—a whispered rumor has begun to spread.""*

*---*

I ran *Through Ultan's Door* (issue 1) for my gang as an interlude from playtesting [our far crunchier game](https://incunabuli.com/rulebook/).

For it, I cobbled together [CRIMINAL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qsMWcADCtmszFL_4Sp8y6t_8GIxh6HVH0suAe5KbhQU/edit?usp=sharing), a one-page rogues-only hack of the [1d6 thieving rules](https://tsojcanth.wordpress.com/2010/03/20/1d6-thieving/) from Paulo Greco and the [dueling rules](https://cavegirlgames.blogspot.com/2018/06/duels-in-osr.html) by Emmy Allen, both featured in *Knock!*.

(Technically, it's 3 pages right now, but pages 2–3 are player-facing campaign notes/materials)

**The vibe:** An all-rogues party. Sneakthieves, alley cats, bouncers, and street-duelists with a tenuous grasp on a loot-driven life.

Four sessions in, it delivers simplicity, rapid progression, and a clear, fast gameplay loop of ""get in, get loot, get out, regear, level up, repeat."" The barely-there city setting of *TUD* (which I elected to make a hodgepodge of renaissance Venice and Edo) serves as a minimalist, safe home base to populate with *Diablo*\-style vendors, shop stocks updated with new gear once a session.

One issue in, the oldschool vibe has kicked in hard. The pieces fall neatly together. We will see how it holds up for Issue 2 and the broadening scope of the Great Sewer River.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x121ea0f50>,osr,1741554862.0

Which OSR works best as a 3.0/3.5e replacement?,"Hello everyone, 

I am a forever DM and since my players always played 3.5 thats what I am stuck with.  
As a consequence I only play dnd 3.5 level lock games Lv6-8. Everything above that is just way too much work for me as a DM.

I read a bit into other systems too. PF2e, 5e, Conan, Worlds woithout number, OSR, fate...

One of my players has a huge library of old dnd 3.0-3.5e adventures that we would still like to use.  
  
**So what I am looking for is a system that creates less work for me as a DM compared to 3.5 but has also a better design (buff stacking, imbalance etc) while making it easy to adapt 3.0e or 3.5e adventures into it.**

PC stress mechanics,"Throughout all my time with rpgs I've been interested in the effects of psychological pressure on player characters.

I tend to prefer behavioural changes coming from players making their own roleplaying choices.

But… I did want a mechanical framework that encodes how stress takes its toll on characters. So I cooked up [my own take that focuses on the physiological impacts of stress](https://murkdice.substack.com/p/the-body-keeps-the-score-for-ttrpgs) instead, which just like player directives isn't going be for everyone but I'm interested in what folks think of it.

How OSR are spell points?,"So, OSR play is very largely about resource management and having spells be just another resource. Vancian magic is a very baked in thing for that, but I feel like enthusiasm for Vancian magic has really waned in the OSR scene. Roll to cast is increasingly used in popular games like DCC and Shadowdark (I believe). I, too, am wondering how necessary or integral Vancian magic is for the OSR experience.

I'm currently interested in the possibilities of a spell point system. What I envision is a pool of spell points that recovers over time, rather than the Vancian way of getting everything back overnight (or rather, by memorizing spells in the morning). You'd probably get a small fixed percentage back per hour. I think the idea is that mages sort of take in ambient energy/magic/whatever and expend it in the form of spells. 

There'd be neat little ways this would work with classes and ability scores, such as a ""Healer"" class casting healing spells for half the spell points but casting offensive spells for double the cost (taken straight from Elder Scrolls: Arena), and high prime requisite spellcasters getting bonus spell points rather than XP progression bonuses.

So, how compatible or incompatible do you think such a system would be with the OSR experience? Classic D&D is all about the ticking clock of resources being expended over the adventuring day, so I could see spell points that gradually recover over time (but not easily refilling) taking away from that. Plus, D&D's lurching progression of skyrocketing in power after getting milestone spells like Fireball would not be a feature of this game. 

I think a benefit of this system would be for spellcasters to not just be out of magic for the entire day. You can always portion it, but if you use it all in a key encounter, you could potentially recover enough for some more minor magic in a few hours. I think there could be interesting resource management aspects to that regarding which spells you cast and when. 

Plus, I think spell creation could be easier and maybe even systemitized if it was point based. 

What do you think? Do you think spell points would add or detract from the OSR experience? Let me know. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x12220bef0>,osr,1741506478.0

The Unhallowed Sea,"Been working on some Cosmology for my campaign setting(Celestria). [The Unhallowed Sea ](https://dragonsdrinkfree.com/2025/03/08/the-unhallowed-sea/)is where Devils call home within my setting. Fair warning my writing tends to be a little ramble-y, and I definitely use the word ""Devils"" way to often in this...but overall I'm happy with the concepts behind it.

Beyond the material plane lies a quiet place. A somber plane of existence where Devils dwell and an eternal fog covers a quiet sea which connects scattered islands. Though the Unhallowed sea seems a restful place at first glance, its eerie expanse is one of great danger. Beneath the calm pale waters leviathans dwell, and the islands that break up the expanse are the domains of Devils.

# The Devils of the Sea

Devils are beings of Law and contract. They bargain for the souls of mortal beings, striking complex deals in exchange for a sentence to be served by the soul after death. It is said that no Devil may pen a contract in which a soul is bound eternally. Each contract has a stipulated term of purgatory before a soul will be released to whatever after plane they are drawn. That said, while a Devil will never break letter of their contract they are masters of complex logic and precise dealings, their contracts are trapped with tricks and loopholes that extend and obscure the length of a souls sentence. Few souls who find themselves bound to a Devils power ever see themselves released. This trickery is vitally important to them, for Devils grow in power only through accumulation of bound souls. The more souls they have bound, and the longer those souls remain bound the more powerful a Devil becomes.

Devils gather themselves into Firms. Coalitions of service in which one or two elder Devils are at the top, and many others serve under them. Lesser Devils serve under the elder Devils of the firm, giving up the majority of the power earned through a souls acquisition in exchange for the protection and guidance of those above them. All Devils dream of the day they are either promoted to Partner within their firm, or instead have gained enough power and influence to strike it out alone and form their own Firm.

When Devils form a form it manifests as a physical space within the Unhallowed Sea. An island birthed into the fogs. As the firm gains more souls, and by extension more power and influence Their island grows, the sea ever shifting, reshaping, expanding and contracting to fit the needs of the the islands found within its waters. The greater the power held by a Firm the more distant it is able to stay from other islands within the sea. Additionally the fog grows more thick around their island, and more difficult to traverse. This is of vital importance for Rival firms are always looking to steal contracts and by extension the souls that are tied to it.

# The Leviathans below

While the Devils and their Islands represent a great danger to any that find themselves within the Unhallowed sea they are not the ONLY danger. Beneath the waters is the realm of the lost. The hunting grounds of great leviathans.

A devil without a Contract is no Devil at all. This is the very reason lesser Devils allow themselves to be tied into service. For without the power of bound souls to draw sustenance from a Devil starves. Sometimes occurs because they have had their contracts stolen. Sometimes because a Firm casts them out (a fate even Elder Partners are not always immune to). Sometimes it is because a foolish Devil may have over extended themselves, drawing forth more power than they had access to in hopes that they would be able to leverage that power to win big in the long run and the bet doesn't pay off, Burning out the souls in their possession and leaving the Devil in question powerless.

When this happen Devils have three choices (or perhaps two choices, and a consequence): They may Find another Firm, Find another Contract, Or wither into a husk and be thrown out like trash. The third possibility is where leviathans come into being. Devils cannot truly die, but being without a soul to draw sustenance from is a torment beyond comprehension. It leads to madness. The remnants of Devils cast into the Unhallowed sea roam there eternally seeking sustenance. Mindless beasts twisted in desire and shape. They can never regain themselves. Never again be what any Self respecting Devil would ever describe as ""A Devil"". But even that is not the end.

As clever and careful as Devils are in their contracts, and the defense of the souls under their power. Sometimes mistakes happen. Sometimes souls that should be bound manage to slip through the cracks. A stolen contract that is lost before it reaches a new Firm's vault. A contract that had an unexpected exit clause that leaves a soul without serving its sentence(and by extension release) while also no longer being held captive. And sometimes unbound souls from outside the unhallowed sea come into the plane for reasons of their own, but become lost. For whatever the reason sometimes souls find their way into the depths of those pale quiet waters… At which point all too often they are found and devoured by those remnants of Devils long gone to madness.

Feasting upon the lost souls allows those husks to regain power, but it is not a stable, long lasting power granted by a contract. Devouring lost souls is a savage, feral feast which sates their hunger for only a short time. The husks regain strength, becoming twisted monstrosities referred to as Leviathans. These beasts form their own ecosystem. Fighting for hunting grounds, devouring what souls they can, and devouring each other whenever possible. Few husks last long enough to fully achieve ""Leviathan"" status, as they themselves are fair game for whatever elder Leviathans might happen to find them.

Though they have not the delicate and precise power of Devils at their best, leviathans can grow to be of massive size and power. Some Devils of great power have themselves gone missing in the endless for of the Unhallowed sea, devoured by beasts from below.

Though their exact nature is hard to quantify it is said that if you can manage to ""slay"" one of the beasts you may carve away draw out its potent blood, carve away its flesh, and take its bones. All of which are enriched by great power and are of great value to those with the knowledge to make use of them. of course since no devil can truly die, even a leviathan corpse can be returned to the sea where it may itself be devoured by another, or perhaps will someday reconstitute itself to begin its growth again.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x12222dd90>,osr,1741470123.0

Does anyone else feel like the scene is getting stale?,"Not a rant, nor complaining, I’m trying to spark discussion. 

Does anyone else feel like the OSR scene is getting stale? I feel like I see way fewer blog posts nowadays, and that every recent product release is either:

1) A rehash of a game (often OSE or Mork Borg)we already have with a few house rules. 

2) An art piece masquerading as a TTRPG product. Utterly unusable at the table and only hood to look at. 

Maybe I’m just out of the loop but it seems like we’re getting so much less new and creative stuff nowadays. That’s not to say that there’s nothing new and creative (Crowns 2e is cool!), just that the days of endless truly creative stuff is gone. 

Truly, I fear that we have reached the end point of commercialization in our niche hobby. It is easier and more lucrative to appeal to TTRPG book collecters rather than TTRPG player, and thus we see more and more product focused at them. 

Or matbe I’m full of doom and gloom. Perhaps I have rose tinted glasses on for the past. I was not there after all, so perhaps I am mythologizing what came before. 

So like, are things getting more stale? Are they getting less interesting? Or am I just losing it?

New adventure: ‘Serpent’s Sanctum’ – a look inside!,"Hey everyone!

Last week I released my new **system–neutral** adventure called ‘Serpent’s Sanctum’:  https://www.patreon.com/undelved

I’d love to share a little more of what you can expect within the module:

The module is a dungeon delve into the darkness of an old mausoleum – deep within its secret halls you’ll find the work room of a grand wizard.

Here you’ll meet **Lyra** the **Untethered Heart** – the actual ever–beating heart of her father Sesvarin: once a grand wizard, now an immortal Serpent roaming the caves, cursed with an insatiable hunger. A ritual of immortality failed terribly, resulting in this mad fusion of Lyra and Sesvarins heart. For 100 years Lyra’s been trapped here, cursed to keep **The Serpent** alive in perpetuity.

cxxx{}:;:;:;:;:;:;:;:;:;:;:;:;:;:;:;:;>

*100 years ago, a mighty wizard & their child died in a tragic fire, thought to his be the effect of a powerful curse. They were buried by local villagers in the wizard's secluded mausoleum. Thinking the curse might be lingering, the villagers feared the mausoleum & left it to weather & decay. Now, 100 years later, people are mysteriously disappearing from the village – and the locals seem to blame the old cursed mausoleum. But – is it really a curse, or has something else been lingering for all these years?*

The module is **40 pages** of dungeon delving, containing: 
- 2 entrances/exits.
- 23 keyed areas.
- A full color isometric map.
- 6 unique denizens to interact with, disturb, or avoid – All illustrated.
- Hooks & rumours for the PCs.
- Traps & ambushes to avoid or overcome. 
- Moral dilemmas to overcome.
- Treasure & Oddities to find in dark places. 
- And much more.

Check out the full module:

"[PSA] Massive print cost increase coming to DriveThruRPG effective April 1, 2025","[DriveThruRPG](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/browse?ffiliate_id=2150725) and associated sites will soon increase cost of print-on-demand products from 10% to 80%, depending on print binding and location:

**EDIT: UPDATED ANNOUNCEMENT**

***Upcoming Print-on-Demand Book Price Changes – Effective April 1, 2025***

*We always want to keep print costs as low as possible, and it has been years since we passed any price increases through to our publishing partners.*

*However, our print supplier, Lightning Source/Ingram, has announced a price adjustment starting April 1, 2025, that will be reflected on DriveThru sites.*

***Key Changes***

* _Due to increasing supply costs in the US, **Black & White print costs in the US will increase significantly**, from around 20% for low-pagecount hardcover titles up to about 50% or slightly more for large hardcover books, and with softcover titles seeing an even greater increase._
* _**UK print costs for Black & White books will also increase**, but generally only by 3-4%._
* _**Standard Color print costs will increase**, by roughly 12-13% for US printing but only around 3% for UK printing._
* _On the whole, **Premium Color print costs will decrease slightly for US printing but increase slightly for UK printing.**_
     * _Example 1: A 180-page large premium hardcover currently costs $32.10 to print in the US; after April 1, that same title will drop to $27.80._
     * _Example 2: In the UK, the same 180-page book currently costs £20.23, which will increase to £20.93 starting in April._

Above will most likely lead to publishers increasing prices on the books, especially those who use at-cost pricing. I ordered all hardbacks from my wish-list, just in case. :)

Do you prefer a simple system, where you roll against a certain DC (Saving Throw) to see if your spell is sucessful of not.

How exactly do hunts work in Into the Wyrd and Wild?,"I've finally gotten a chance to run another campaign, this time doing a Witcher style monster hunting campaign. That means I've also finally gotten to use Into the Wyrd and Wild. 

My players have taken thier first contract and are going to begin the hunt next session. I read over the hunting rules for W&W again and noticed something important that's not explained:

While the basic premise for hunting is simple (assign the target a number of marks, roll each in-game day to collect marks, once all marks are acquired you find your target), what it doesn't explain is **where is the party supposed to be going while collecting these marks?** Are they just supposed to be bumbling around random hexes rolling for marks? Do they squat in one hex of thier chosing and roll for marks until they find thier target? Am I supposed to have a chosen spot for the monster to be (doesn't seem to make sense given the mark system)? 

Maybe the answer is obvious and I'm just dumb, but I realized that I didn't have a clear answer for myself after reading the book.

Help me understand the meta-game of BFRPG,"TLDR: What does advancement look like in this game? Just bloated HP and higher to-hit bonus? What about damage or attribute boosts? Is all damage really about magic weapons?

- - - - - - - - - 

I'm a solo player and Basic Fantasy (BFRPG) is the only D&D-like game I've played besides Worlds Without Number (WWN).

I'm running a hexcrawl. I had two sessions with a party, then had a TPK. Pretty awesome too! 😆

My second party is two sessions in, And I've got serious questions having sunk my teeth into the rules. 

Looking at the way advancement works, the only real difference between a Lv1 Fighter and a Lv20 Fighter is +9 to-hit bonus and a bunch of HP. 

They still theoretically have the same:

- Ability Score
- Ability Score bonus
- Armor Class
- Damage output (1d8 sword)

That feels really really strange to me. I know magic users, clerics, and thrives get more abilities, but still their stats are static except for to-hit bonus and HP. 

WWN let's you gain +1 to an Ability Score per level a max of three times at least. 

Are higher damage weapons a thing in this game, and if so, whats reasonable?

Is a lv 20 Fighter using an enchanted sword that does 5d8+10 damage or something?

Suggest me OSR for solo play.,"I play exclusively solo. I have three ""slots"" for my games.

1. I picked Cairn for my NSR experience. My setting is dark fantasy mixed with sword and sorcery (Conan).

2. I selected various PBTA games (Ironsworn, Winsmore) for my story games. Those are low fantasy.

3. I need a game for a pure OSR experience. I want a ""classic"" fantasy setting.


Can this wonderful community help me decide on a system that would fit slot number three?

I usually play with one character and a sidekick plus hirelings. I use a physical notebook for bullet point notes or more detailed fragments. I also use a tablet for PDFs. I don't use minis, though, as I like portability. 

I wonder how it would feel to play something different from NSR or story games, and I am aiming for a ""full party"" OSR experience in solo mode. I considered Scarlet Heroes, Black Tides, and Just One Torch procedures to play with one character, but I've decided to break my rule of having a single main character to get closer to the original OSR experience. I want to play with a full party (3-4 is right number?). 

I don't like very crunchy systems, but OSRs are quite light in general. I like to have at least a pinch more ""game and structure"" than in CAIRN but I don't want to be buried under bookkeeping demands.
I also considered Shadowdark, but I would pass on this occasion, as I want to achieve a more pure OSR experience. For me, Shadowdark is more of an NSR game, because it blends with some 5e concepts, and I am already playing Cairn in NSR slot. 

I'm not sure if I want something closer to 0D&D or B/X. I think it would mainly be about exploration but not only dungeoneering. I guess I would like to explore a bit of the surface as well. Potentially playing a bit of a campaign would allow me to see how character advancement works in OSR (Cairn has Scars mechanics, but I want something more traditional).

As you probably guessed, I did not play original B/X or 0D&D back in the day, so I don't feel nostalgic about it. I am just curious, and I love the concepts in Principia Apocrypha or the OSR Primer.

QUESTIONS:

1. What game would you suggest I play?

2. Do you think playing with an analog notebook would be doable and pleasant (I love my fountain pen!), or would you suggest jumping on some kind of word processing software like OneNote or Obsidian? It is tempting to copy and paste some fragments and have notes in one tool along with my PDFs; also, tracking light, weight, and ammo is simpler than in an analog method.

3. Bonus question: Can you suggest a setting and some supplements, please? Something that enhances solo OSR play, like additional optional procedures, tools, or collections of random tables that would work with the game you suggest.

Thank you!

The guide updates and expands on the 2008 writeup in **Fight On!** magazine #03, reflecting the one and a half decade of gaming that has taken place in the setting since that point.

*“Fomalhaut is a world whose origins coincide with the discussions that formed the modern understanding of old-school gaming in the mid-2000. Inspired by the rediscovery of Judges Guild (particularly Wilderlands of High Fantasy), the “Appendix N” books, and the stranger aspects of old-school play, it is a distillation of influences that make these games distinct and powerful.*

*This is a setting of bold sword & sorcery, where the Techno-Hellenic age fell in destructive interstellar wars, and was succeeded by one of iron and bronze. Here, the descendants of Man have fractured into a myriad strange societies in a changed world, some warlike, some reclusive, and some surprisingly civilised. Philosophy, religion, and cultural variety are rife with exception and local colour. But “in every age, in every place, the deeds of men remain the same” – and for all its strangeness, this setting, and the adventures you can find therein, should be immediately recognisable to fans of sword & sorcery adventure.*

*And where adventures are concerned, Fomalhaut can offer them in abundance: in barren wastelands dotted with the remnants of fallen empires, on wine-dark seas where splendid isles and reclusive civilisations await, in teeming cities where life is cheap and the sword can gain what even money cannot buy, deep underground in forgotten vaults and subterranean lands; and perhaps even beyond – in strange dimensions and the domains of mirages and dreams. Men of many devices shall win it all, while those who shrink back shall be forever forgotten!”*

More detailed setting information and a preview of the deities section is found in [this post](https://beyondfomalhaut.blogspot.com/2024/12/blog-towards-fomalhaut-and-what-it-is.html).

The booklet includes the following materials:

* An introduction to the setting 4000 years after its foundation by a starfaring civilisation, and some 3200 after this civilisation’s downfall.
* A writeup of Fomalhaut’s gods and ideologies, and the practices of worship for Clerics, divine champions dedicated to a god’s cause, as well as laymen. 28 deities are discussed from Kang the Thousand-Eyed, rapacious God of Adventurers; and Mereskan the Bat-God, patron of thieves; to the Followers of the LOGOS, a sect of philosophers dedicated to the arts of mathematics and geometry; and the Idolators of Dhakam, a barbarous cult worshipping crumbling idols in the wastelands.
* A description of Fomalhaut’s regions, with its colourful mosaic of civilisations. Visit the ruined landscape of the Worn Lands, discover the mysteries of the Plateau of Ong whose cruel monks allow no stranger intruding on their domain to live, and sail seas hiding fantastic islands and fallen utopias.
* A brief guide to adventuring in the setting, with its people – from the mammoth-hunting cavemen of the northern ice wastes to the decadent descendants of the Empire of Mung, masters of ancient technologies.
* A two-sided setting overview map, with one side drawn by Sean Stone.

**A Voyage to Fomalhaut** features cover art by Peter Mullen, and interiors by Cameron Hawkey, Graphite Prime, and various Golden Age illustrators (including some by the incomparable Virginia Frances Sterrett). The print version of the supplement is available from my [**Bigcartel store**](https://emdt.bigcartel.com/); the PDF edition will be published through DriveThruRPG with a few months’ delay. As always, customers who buy the print edition will receive the PDF version free of charge.

Converting powers from OSR games to Fallen Justice OSR,"Hi there!

I'm working on a Batman setting using Fallen Justice OSR where the players are well known bat-family members (Hunter, Red Hood, Catwoman, Robin, ...) and even it's a vigilante -low powered games, some gotham villains have powers so I want to convert in the most easy way powers from another OSR games to the Fallen Justice OSR (I think it is based on White Box from Swords & Wizardry).

Dragon Magazine find at the HPB.,"Found this in a magazine rack, was like oh hey!

I know or assume most DM's don't like to deal with the headache (heh) of introducing psychic powers into their games. As for me I've always been a fan even during 2nd edition. I did enjoy how psychic powers were introduced again for 3e, and I have ran games in 3rd edition games using them including Dreamscarred Press Pathfinder take on psychic abilities.

I'll always find some excuse to introduce them in some shape of form especially with monsters. That said was intrigued to find this and decided to get it. 

What about y'all, psychic powers off the table for your OSR games?

If you are interested I would suggest taking a look at this.

Prose and Story in Modules,"I'm working on my own hex map campaign setting and been running Blackmarsh for the last five months or so. It just recently hit me why I prefer OSR modules and content, even though I run Pathfinder 1e or D&D 3.5: they just leave so much more to the imagination.

I don't know if this is true, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but most early D&D and OSR content focuses on the map, the story hooks, and the tools, while later systems focused a lot more on story telling. Sometimes this story telling would include mandatory short stories to understand NPC motivation, and whole blocks of prose intended to be read to the players. There is nothing wrong with that. I just find that I can present myself more confidently with less specifics.

Are there many examples of the more narrative style in OSR modules, or map and tool centered adventures for newer games?

The left path leads to some enemies that have holed up (kobolds?). I recall there also being a storage room with a flour trap and I think a dire weasel hiding there. 

The rightward path leads downwards into an area piled with corpses and several undead.

Lockpicking Failure Results in Time Tax,"I've seen a few people suggest this a way to handle percentile Thief skills, and I've also considered it. The way I imagine it working is that when a lockpicking attempt fails, rather than having the Thief be unable to even attempt that lock again until they gain a level, they simply expend a unit of time and get to try again. In an old-school format, I would expect that to be a turn (10 minutes). So, if it requires three attempts for a Thief to open a lock, then 3 turns/30 minutes/3 wandering monster checks are the most for success. 

Alternatively, it could only start taking entire turns after the first failure. So, if it takes three rolls to pass your Open Locks check, then it took 2 turns or 20 minutes. I think this latter option might be more reasonable.

I would probably add in some kind of fail state; maybe rolling 00 results in thief's tools breaking or the lock being simply impossible. Maybe different locks are of different difficulty levels and allow for a different number of attempts before being locked out of opening them.

The first consideration is whether it's a positive improvement gameplay-wise to make all locks passable. If all it takes is time to get past a lock, can that result in locks being too minimal of an obstacle? Can that encourage players to camp by a lock rather than moving through the dungeon trying all the locks they find, bottling exploration? Is the hypothetical replay value of impassable locks something worth keeping?

A second consideration is simulationism. Since you can attempt to open a lock many more times in 20 minutes than you can in 20 seconds or so, you should be rewarded for spending time on it. At the same time, though, it surely isn't the case that any lock can be opened by any lockpicker if they just spend enough time doing. Maybe there should be a limit to how many lockpicking attempts you can make; maybe 7. If you can't get it in an hour, then it's probably hopeless.

The third consideration is class balance. The old-school balance between Thieves and Magic-Users with Knock is that one is free while the other has the cost of a spell slog and the opportunity cost of not memorizing a potentially life-saving spell. With the standard rules, Knock usually knocks Thieves out of the park. With unlimited or minimally limited lockpicking attempts, Knock is only valuable in terms of saving time, as, either way, that lock is getting opened.

Maybe a fourth consideration is if the low odds of success with Thief skills encourages an old-school, creative style of play by usually requiring you to think outside your class. But that's a can of worms...

What do you think? Do you allow Thieves multiple attempts to pick locks? Do you think my solution of giving unlimited attempts with each failure after the first costing a turn is a reasonable solution? Or would you pick some other system?

"D&D 5e player, interested in Old School Essentials.  Looking for experiences.","Hi everyone,

I've played D&D since 4e, but I've always gravitated to using running games with less emphasis on rules and limiting longer combat sessions.  I didn't really understand the history of D&D and that there was a basic / extended version of D&D that was separate from AD&D.

That leads me to my post.  I'm interested in how OSE (B/X) differs from 5e (at a high level).  Are there folks here that have experience with both (I'd imagine the answer is yes)?  What are the strengths / weaknesses of both systems.  Are there any serious limitations with OSE (B/X) that people have run into?  Do players sometimes complain?

I'm hopeful that OSE would be a good fit for our gaming group.

Trying to remember where I found a specific really excellent blog post on making Hex Maps,"I'll give what I remember here: 
- it was more focused on how to think about the map than pointing out actual tools to use or anything like that
- it was a series of posts spread across maybe 5-8 entries or so? My brain is saying 6 but that could just be conflating my memory with ""hex""
- gave a lot of detail on how to make realistic landscapes in a specific order - starting with the topography, determining mountains and valleys and then understanding where water would flow according to that, etc etc and eventually moving on to monster ecology and I believe faction interplay toward the end, though that could be from elsewhere.

Deep-Dive: Running High-Stakes Narratives & Moral Dilemmas in an OSR/OSRIC Game,"After writing my next module, *N1: Desperate Dusty Desperados*, I thought it worthwhile to share some insights on running high-stakes narratives and moral dilemmas in an OSR/OSRIC framework.

There’s a persistent myth that OSR-style adventures are all about dungeon crawling and tactical combat, and that heavy roleplay or ethical decision-making don’t fit. I disagree. The best OSR/OSRIC games aren’t just about survival—they’re about player-driven storytelling, and that includes tough moral choices.

I wanted to share some practical insights for DMs who want to introduce meaningful moral dilemmas into their OSR campaigns without railroading players or undermining the game’s core mechanics.

# 1. The Art of the No-Win Scenario

One of the best ways to raise the stakes in an adventure is to present choices without an obvious ""correct"" answer. These aren’t just about binary “good vs. evil” dilemmas—real, gut-wrenching decisions arise when both sides of an issue have valid perspectives and real consequences.

For example, in *Desperate Dusty Desperados* has this as one of the possible encounters.

**Stoats and Spiders**: A group of *lawful neutral* stoats is forcing captive *lawful evil* rats (orcs) to process cochineal into red dye. Freeing the rats could be an act of justice or a foolish blunder as they later raid and pillage a nearby settlement. Do your players act on principle or pragmatism?

# How to Apply This in Your Games

* Make NPCs complex, not caricatures. Even villains should have motivations players can understand, even if they don’t agree.
* Don’t dictate a solution. Lay out the problem, let the players solve it.
* Tie choices to lasting consequences. Let decisions echo forward. A freed enemy might return with allies. A town might remember the party’s mercy—or see it as weakness.

# 2. Player-Led Problem Solving

A common pitfall when introducing moral dilemmas is structuring them like puzzles with a “correct” answer. That’s antithetical to good OSR/OSRIC play. Instead, the best dilemmas are the ones that emerge naturally from the players’ choices.

For example, if a desperate mining town is on the verge of collapse because bandits are cutting off supply lines, the dilemma shouldn’t be a pre-packaged “do you fight the bandits or not?” Instead, let the players explore the problem from multiple angles:

* Can they broker a deal between the miners and the outlaws?
* Do they raise a militia and risk turning the town into a battlefield?
* Would they try to outmaneuver the bandits, sneaking in supplies and avoiding direct conflict?
* Is there an alternative trade route that no one has considered?

The trick is to present problems, not solutions. The best moments in OSR games come from players inventing their own ways forward, rather than picking from a menu of DM-approved options.

# How to Apply This in Your Games

* Frame choices as emergent problems. Instead of ""Do you help the NPC?"" ask, “This NPC is in danger. What do you do?”
* Encourage creative problem-solving. Reward ingenuity, even if the players sidestep your expected solutions.
* Let the dice decide. OSR-style games thrive on uncertainty. A noble idea might fail spectacularly. Let it happen.

# 3. The Importance of Reputation & Consequences

A great way to reinforce moral choices is through in-world consequences. If the players choose to ally with a faction, that decision should close off some doors and open others. If they betray a group, they shouldn’t just suffer a loss in “alignment points” (who cares?)—they should hear about wanted posters, bounties, and whispers in the dark.

* Double-Cross or Loyalty? The party is offered a high-paying job—but what they’re not told is that accepting it puts them at odds with a powerful faction. What happens when they realize they’re working for the wrong side?
* A Reputation Earned, Not Given. The local sheriff doesn’t trust outsiders, but after witnessing the party’s actions, his attitude changes—for better or worse.
* Enemies Hold Grudges. A bandit leader, humiliated but alive, might come back for revenge later. But if the party killed them, the remaining gang members might scatter—or swear a blood feud.

The best moral dilemmas never fully go away. They linger, shaping the world in subtle (or dramatic) ways.

# How to Apply This in Your Games

* Use NPC gossip & rumors. Let the world react to player choices in a natural way.
* Make alignment matter, but in-world. Not with mechanics, but with how people treat the party.
* Reintroduce past dilemmas later. Maybe that bandit they let go is now the leader of a growing warband.

# Final Thoughts: Moral Dilemmas & OSR/OSRIC

Running high-stakes narratives doesn’t mean you need deep backstories or scripted drama—it just means letting choices matter. In *Desperate Dusty Desperados*, I built dilemmas into the setting itself rather than scripting them into a linear story. The key to making moral dilemmas shine in OSR/OSRIC-style play is to let players find the hard choices on their own—and then let them live with the consequences.

"OSR News Roundup for March 3rd, 2025","ZineMonth is officially over, although there are still projects running that started late in February. I hope everyone who participated by launching a project had a fun time and were successful meeting their funding goals, and I hope everyone else saw (and backed) some fun and interesting projects.

This looks to be a pretty light week on the release end of things.

* [**The Crimson Caverns**](https://jofas.itch.io/the-crimson-caverns), by jofas, is a simple dungeon crawl written for Cairn 2e as a one-shot or a short adventure that can be slotted into an existing campaign. Explore the abandoned hideout of an evil sorcerer!
* Inspired in part by the shrines in Breath of the Wild,[ **Pit**](https://bommyknocker-press.itch.io/pit) is the first of a Spell Shrine written for the 2025 Zungeon Jam using Cairn. It's a neat idea; every spellbook has its own shrine that must be found and explored in order to master the contained spell. It's the first in what the author hopes is a planned series.
* [**Wayward Words** ](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ggoods/wayward-words)is a late entry into the Zinemonth festivities and could use some support. It's a system-neutral supplement of weird books arranged in alphabetical orders; each book has something unique to teach the reader.
* The Rainy City is a fun and quirky setting zine that we consistently sell out of at Sabre, and I just saw the author is Kickstarting [**Vol. 3 of Flott's Miscellany**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/the-abzu/flotts-miscellany-volume-three), a new collection of goodies, tables, and encounters for the city where the rain never stops.
* [**Tales from the Spectral Sea**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sam-armstrong/tales-from-the-spectral-sea) looks to be a fun game where you play as the crew of a ship that died at sea but couldn't pass on to the afterlife, and instead sail the spectral sea, ""living"" out your swashbuckling dreams until you can pass on to the afterlife.
* Written for the Mork Borg family of games, [**Wraithborn**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theatremacabre/wraithborn-a-grim-folk-fantasy-setting-for-mork-borg-osr) is a setting where the players take on the role of the undead inhabitants in a realm of the dead and damned.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122776d50>,osr,1741009970.0

Colonial Village Horror Module Advice!,"Hi everyone,

I'm working on a colonial village horror module inspired by [Colonial 'living museum' villages](https://www.osv.org/), Lovecraft, and Bloodborne, for a modern OSR TTRPG.

The basic premise: A colonial village of farmers that stayed largely un-industrialized. Priest in the town discovers an old unfinished underground ritual eldritch complex built by a 1600s evil scientist and his slaves (the slaves and some witches revolted and escaped).

The priest is now trying to perform a ritual to meet an eldritch god, so he's kidnapping people in the town for sacrifice, and dumping the leftovers of their bodies into the nearby pond, causing the beavers in the pond to become fucked up evil carnivore cryptids that make their dam out of corpses.

The players are coming to the old middle-of-nowhere town because they heard about the cryptids, or missing persons, etc.

I know this is similar to Against The Cult of the Reptile God, so I'm looking to that for guidance. I will probably need a small hexmap/pointcrawl, a few dungeons (the ritual complex, the old mansion, etc.), some factions (the priest and his followers, the last witches, the townspeople?).

I want this to be fun, but I'm struggling with connecting all these ideas.

Any and all thoughts (including just ideas adding to this premise) are appreciated!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1226f8230>,osr,1740971513.0

I wrote an OSR-inspired fantasy novel,"I've just published my OSR-inspired fantasy novel, *House of the Rain King*. I think if you're into old school D&D, you'll love this book! But rather than giving you the regular pitch that I give to fantasy fans, I thought I'd talk about the OSR influences and how the book developed from an adventure module into a novel.

Way back, probably 6 or 7 years ago, I was reading James Raggi's *Better Than Any Man.* This adventure module had a lot of issues, but I fell in love with its core mechanic. In the module, the Swedish army is sweeping across the land and killing everything in its path. The army moves across the hexmap each day according to a schedule, and when they reach a town or adventure site, they destroy everything there. If the players didn't go to that site, too bad - it's gone now.

At the same time I was reading Michael Swanwick's classic sci-fi novel *Stations of the Tide*, which is about a planet suffering a once-in-a-generation high tide that will flood the entire continent.

The two ideas combined in my head as an adventure module where the PCs visit a valley that is gradually flooding. There would be a hexmap showing the growth of the river and lake each day, until finally everything is underwater. There would also be dungeons that flood from the bottom up, potentially submerging treasure but also sometimes opening new pathways.

I found a lot of dynamism in this premise. When floods come, people have to abandon lots of material possessions, so there would be plenty of opportunities for the PCs to grab stuff if they are willing to risk the rising waters. 

Around this time I also read Raggi's *The God That Crawls,* a dungeon containing a single invincible monster. This gave me the idea of a flooding dungeon inhabited by a senile rain god who wanders the halls in a stupor. He isn't very fast or aggressive, but if you get too close to him you will suffocate (too much moisture in the air). The rain god is also the reason the whole valley is flooding.

I never got to run this module, however.

Various issues led to the collapse of my online and offline gaming groups, and for a few years I didn't play D&D at all.

That was when I came up with the idea of turning the adventure module into a novel.

Long story short - all the stuff I described above is in the novel. The novel is told from the POV of the ""adventuring party"" (mercenaries who've recently arrived in the valley) as well as from several of the local people trying to survive the flood.

In writing the novel I added some elements that would appeal to traditional fantasy fans, but there is still a lot of OSR DNA in there. For instance, you will find:

* verb-noun spellcasting
* random encounters
* a dungeon crawl
* an egalitarian band of adventurers who resolve their disputes by arguing a lot
* shenanigans involving ropes and lanterns
* weird monsters
* treasure

(There is also one scene that has a specific reference to something from the AD&D Dungeon Master's Guide... I don't know if anyone will spot it though.)

Light source dice rule — torch or lantern ?,"Hello,

At my table, we've been using the light dice rule for **wolf-packs and winter snow** (might be from another RPG originally but that's the one I know it from). For those who don't know, basically a light source has its own category of dice (like damage from weapons), from a d4 for a humble candle to a d6 or d8 for a torch or lantern. Each time you get in a situation where the light might be extinguished (like getting shoved), you roll the light die and on a certain number (1-2 or 1-3 depending on your system), the light die loses a category (from d8 to d6, d6 to d4, and eventually d4 to darkness). Additionally, you roll the light die once every hour or so (might be more or less, I like the 3 turns logic personnally for a more horrific type of play).

My question to you is, which should be the higher light die, a torch or lantern ? Some at the table have argued that the torch is more likely to get extinguished by strong wind or humidity, but that the lantern is more likely to get broken by any type of shock.

I ask for thy guidance, O Great Old Ones, so you may light my way throught this insignificant conundrum.

Good day to you,

tldr ; which is the reliable source of light ? Torch or lantern ?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122915ca0>,osr,1740851867.0

At first I wasn't sure if I roll D table twice since I defeated two or once since the D type is for Lair.

And the question of prime importance for next session: are oozes warm? Or warm-blooded? What would you say?

Maybe it's in the spirit of the game if all monsters are hot? Beside perhaps the explicitly cold-blooded types like snake people or the bloodless types like skeletons?

What do you do at your table and what's your verdict on the ooze?

Running a session with less prep than you'd like,"**Situation:** You're running a session tonight, but due to a stressful day at work, you haven't had as much time to prep / mentally prepare as you'd normally have for the locations/events that you seeded in the previous session. What do you do?

I find myself in this situation from time to time. There are locations, factions, and NPCs that I've seeded in previous sessions, but I haven't had the time to flesh them out, think through motivations, etc. These sessions often feel the most thin, IMO, compared to when I have time to put interesting ideas in a dungeon, or have time to get my head around a pre-written dungeon and how I want to run it.

I know some common advice in this situation will be about how to run a low-prep game, leaning more on improv and random tables, things like that. That's not really the advice I'm looking for here. I'm more wondering what you do when you have seeded certain locations/events and now don't feel ready for them.

A few ways I've approached it:

* Run it anyway and accept that I won't feel like it was my best work

* Have a meta conversation with the group about where I'm at with prep. This always goes over well, no hard feelings, but it also fundamentally removes some of the verisimilitude of the world, which I find disappointing.

* ...so, sometimes I dig through my stack of zines and find something I know well, then find a way to put that in front of the party as an enticing hook. Close to a railroad, I know, but sometimes it's the easiest way for me to run a session.

I don't see too much meta discussion about the actual logistics of running a regular game - interested to hear everyone's feedback!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122a481d0>,osr,1740754565.0

Improvising and riffing off of published Adventures,"I'm running an old school Adventure I won't name so what I'm about to write aren't spoilers. If you've played or run it you may recognize the scenarios. 

I run a low fantasy campaign but the party has entered Elfland or the realm of Faery so I could run over the top stuff like this. 

Takes place in a castle and the party sat down to a feast. I used almost the entire description but entirely eliminated the ""ghostly"" aspect of the scene. The players enjoyed the detailed description of each course. I use some of the side effects from consuming each dish but ditched the save versus death on two of the items as that definitely would not have been fun.

There was a boxing match scene, and I decided to make the champion a satyr instead of the written character. He strutted about like a pro wrestler. Started chasing around a dwarf jester around the room first (rodeo style) and after knocking him down the offer went to the players to challenge him.

I did the unarmed damage as written but on a roll of an 18 he would head butt with his ram horns for 1d10 damage. There was a lot of laughing as three of the players decided to challenge him.


I put all of the greenhouse scenes out in an actual Forest. 

I used to the squirrels and their acorns. Rather than being greedy, the party actually made a gesture of kindness to the squirrels in the squirrels reciprocated. 


They met the lady and the unicorn. A warlock character has a owl familiar and she has a telepathic bond with. The owl was flying overhead and so came back and gave them news to what was up The path. One of the bards decided to sing a song as they approached and they heard the unicorn gallop away but met the maiden. She gave them some information relevant to them quest.

Back in the day when we had endless hours to play we ran through all of the published modules more or less as written. 

These days I have just two to three hours per week for our in-person game to play so I just pull encounters that I think would be the most fun and change them up a little bit to fit my world better and time it out for the actual session.

The plan is to have the PCs use the market town as a base, and use their loot to rebuild the place in between dealing with the forces the old earl unleashed/raised as undead/hired to squeeze the peasants for more tax money.

Roman Paces,"Big if true. 

A “pace” is apparently about five feet. (*Source: Roman history bros*)

If you use 5’ squares on your dungeon maps (like a sane person), convert your movement system to paces. This simplifies the bejesus out of movement rates.

Encounter speeds of 40’, 30’, 20’, and 15’ become 8, 6, 4, and 3 “paces” (squares) on your grid.

Exploration speeds of 120’, 90, 60, and 30 become 24, 18, 12, and 6 paces (squares).

When to give IOUN stones?,"I would argue that some IOUN stones should be given after 3rd or 4th level after the players get into the rhythm of things. I like the idea of the PCs finding two early and much later finding three more. The first two I think should be something like +1 to a stat so that it gives them benefits but also a target on their backs early game. Also, certain IOUN stones become next to useless the higher level your PCs are depending on their loot and skills. Who needs an IOUN stone of disease immunity if you have five other magical items that do that? Plus, I've heard it said when a player finds one ""would've love to have this earlier!""

Putting multiple factions in a single castle?,"Hey all,

I designed a ruined castle dungeon. The premise was it was taken over by a horde of necromancer warriors. It was really fun for the players to explore and get lost in due to the vertical and horizontal connections!

But, because it was so heavily occupied, the flow of the delve was often sneak around->loot things->run into a guard->scramble out (get lost in the process, some PCs die, epic, etc).

The players told me they loved exploring the structure but any combat was a death sentence / forced a retreat from the dungeon it due to how overwhelming the pushback force would be if they were found.

I want to redesign the ruined castle dungeon with more but weaker factions in the same ruins, so players can have fun exploring, engaging with factions, and have combat not be the impossible challenge (but still challenging). For context, there's 6 floors in total (4 above ground, 2 basement).

Any and all ideas on putting multiple factions a ruined castle dungeon are much appreciated!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122b12b40>,osr,1740693494.0
What's the best adventure for learning how to run OSR properly as a GM?,"I've played some OSR adventures like *Hole in the Oak* (OSE) and *Keep on the Borderlands* (BX), but I'm looking for an adventure that actively teaches the **principles of OSR play** to the **GM**, not just providing rooms, encounters, and ideas.

For example, one key OSR principle is *telegraphing danger*—if there's a room full of small broken skeleton pieces and the players want to sneak in, they should be given enough clues to realize stepping inside might make noise. I want an adventure that explains these kinds of responses, rather than just listing what's in each room.

I understand that for many people who've been playing D&D for a long time, especially older editions, this might not seem very useful—they already know and understand these principles because it's how they’ve always played. But for newer players who are just getting into the OSR style, do you know of any adventures that **explicitly** teach the GM how to handle player agency, telegraph threats, and respond dynamically, rather than just presenting a dungeon and expecting you to already know how to run it OSR-style?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122b3f890>,osr,1740646143.0

A Human-Made Vision of the Future – community building with RPGs and zines,"Hey y'all, wanted to share I blog I wrote about the creation of my TTRPG Retrograde. Our Kickstarter campaign is coming to a close this week, and I'm thinking more about the future of my work as an RPG designer and how I see RPGs and zines as opportunities for community building. 

[https://open.substack.com/pub/nathanielklein/p/a-human-made-vision-of-the-future?r=1h9j2g&utm\_campaign=post&utm\_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false](https://open.substack.com/pub/nathanielklein/p/a-human-made-vision-of-the-future?r=1h9j2g&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false)

I've been really inspired by the OSR for Retrograde's design, both in terms of its mechanical principles and its aesthetics. I absolutely love the feel of old school RPG books, and I sought to make Retrograde's zines a physical expression of the game itself. Tactile art and physicalized writing that really appeals to me, and a big part of that appeal is an implicit human-made feeling I find in zines and RPGs. For me, RPGs are fundamentally about coming together around a table and telling stories together, and in a future where human connection looks to be increasingly diluted by algorithms and AI, I'm hoping to use RPGs and physical art as a way to make connections with others and build a community.

Have your players ever become nobility?,"Just wondering how you go about doing this because it seems like it's may come to that pretty soon.

Setting is Dolmenwood, my players are actually siblings (only 2 PC's) who, thanks to the hook in Winter's Daughter, are the descendants of Sir Chyde. To make a long story short, there's a good chance they may help a current lord, Ramius, depose the current baron as well as his dastardly brother, lord Malbleat. 

In the chance that they all pull this off and their patron becomes the new baron, I think he would reward them with a keep and nobility. They would become House Chyde as long as they swore fealty to him. 

They've expressed interest in this path at the table so I do believe they're going to start working toward it. Seems fun to run the intrigues of lords a la Game Of Thrones.

"Spell books, scrolls, libraries, and adventuring spellscribes","I have an idea for an alternate take on D&D magic, and that's removing spell slots and just using written spells. Scrolls would still work as normal (single use), while spellbooks would be incredibly expensive but would have unlimited casting. 

The idea is that it this setting, lower-ranked wizards (""spellscribes,"" maybe) go adventuring in search of scrolls and spell books to add to the collection of their institutions library. Spellbooks take a ton of resources to create and maintain, so they almost never leave the library. 

Spellscribes who are going on an adventure copy out however many spells they can afford/manage onto scrolls and set out. However many spellscrolls they have is their magical budget unless they find more. 

Higher rank spellscribes have underlings to copy out spellscrolls for them and can maybe even manage to take a spellbook with them (though Fireball makes that seriously risky).

I think this could be an interesting take on magic. It would definitely tie magic-users far more closely to their magical institutions and would make their magical resource management be tied to something more concrete and permanent than spell slots. Plus, it would give them a solid motivation to be delving into dungeons. And, it would give them a lasting gold sink in lieu of weapons and armor (which probably should have at least a small upkeep cost).",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122c19850>,osr,1740649811.0

"OSE Oriental Adventures - The Mudang, Priestesses of the Korean Folk religion, also I ditched the Shaman plus announcements","Hello! So I rushed over to remake a class I previously shared, the Shaman. Honestly, looking back at it , it wasn’t the best one, even looking the inaccuracies. Instead I decided to remake it into the Mudang, the (mostly female) priests of Korean’s folk religion.

In their concept they are chosen by gods, most times unwillingly, to mediate between the spirit world and the living world. They can communicate with spirits directly and even get ‘possessed’ by them. Mechanics wise this translates to them being able to acquire statistics from monsters for a certain amount of time, potentially making them pretty powerful I gotta say.

They act as free agents, not really belonging to any order or doctrine or philosophy, they tend to offer services to communities all over as fortune tellers, exorcist and the like, and because they are chosen by deities, naturally they fit into the divine caster category, using the clerics spell list.

So yeah, mostly that’s it for them, I am pretty sure the class looks better now that it’s made more according to Korean folklore, and I think it looks more fun as well, as it allows for roleplaying and interesting situations with its possession mechanics. I decided to stop here for the Korean classes, from here I’ll focus on my third appendix L issue before going to Japan.

However, I wanted to take the opportunity to give some announcements as to what will be next for this project, which will be monsters. I have been gathering multiple sources, some in english and some in chinese, korean and japanese, to make a comprehensive bestiary, I don’t look to make it that extensive either, but I’ll be sure make a good amount of monsters for this project.

Next will be some mechanics, I’ll start with weapons and armor, including fire weapons based on the actual guns developed in China, following by adventure gear, mounts and mercenaries. Another huge additions will be mass combat, ship combat and domain level play, followed by treasure, magic items and generators like encounters, city design, village design, dungeon design, adventure seeds and all that good stuff for sandboxing.  Finally the campaign setting, and I’ll stop there for a moment

A while ago I made a poll to discuss about what would be best for the campaign setting or the structure of the project, and the winner was to make an original one, with genre rules at a close second. Ultimately I decided to take three historical contexts for the setting, just like our regular western fantasy being placed in the middle ages between the 8th-12th centuries. The context will be unique to the three main countries (China, Korea and Japan) to provide some inherent implied setting to what kind of campaign one could expect.

To make it clearer, D&D and most osr games take place in a  post-apocalyptic setting where players explore the ruins of past civilizations, fighting monsters to uncover lost artifacts to become more powerful and fight even bigger meaner monsters. This gameplay loop is what defines the game, but it takes the assumptions of the European context, which is defined by the chaos following the fall of Rome

East Asia doesn’t follow that pattern, though, but it foes follow a cycle of rise and fall of civilizations just not as total as Europe went through. When China falls, for example, it doesn’t mean the “end” of China, only the end of the current holders of the state, the many dinasties that up to very recently were always replaced with another one. Japan is also a nation that has never “fell”, it currently holds the single longest standing royal bloodline after all, it has only changed who and how many hold the reigns of the state and how involved the emperor is with the actual running of things, but never the nation or the state itself. Korea is another thing entirely, a more ethnic based nation rather than a state, in the peninsula there have been cases where many states have been formed and rule simultaneously (heck, to this day we are in one) with the only unchanging factor being the existence of Koreans as part of a single continuous ethnic group. But the cycle of rise, stagnation and collapse of dynasties is what I want to focus on, and for that I decided to take three different periods, one for each country, to depict this cycle, one declining, one rising and one stagnating, not particularly related or belonging to the same time period for each nation, and ai though it could be as follows: 

1- China, the collapse of the Sui Dynasty: A short-lived dynasty that represents everything the chinese nation wants to avoid when managing the state, giving a lot of adventure opportunities for contributing to its collapse, followed by the Tang Dynasty, considered the golden age of China. As for a name for the country in our fantasy pesudo-anachronistic world, I think it’s not to go with a name but with a title, the literal name of China: The Middle Kingdom

2- Korea, the three period kingdom: This is one foundational periods of Korea, where it was divided among three kingdoms: Silla, Baekje and Goguryeo. The unification wars of Korea take place during this time, and it will represent the ascendance of the first unified Korean state. The name of the country will represent the region instead of the kingdoms, and Samhan I think is more appropriate.

3- Japan, the Kamakura period: this is when most of our medieval japan media takes place, and It’s represented by the establishment of the Samurai and the adoption of feudalism to in the country. Civil wars and constant infighting characterize the period, as the Emperor is a figurehead that will not be that active in politics for the next 500 years or so, perfect for a stagnant period. For a name for the country, gotta be honest, I don’t wanna go for Nippon or Nihon, even though they are ancient and established as the names of the country, so the older term Yamato will be used, or as I am gonna call them, the Yamato Isles.

I hope this has been a good read, I have a lot of work ahead of me. Leave some feedback for the class though, I’ll be looking to fix any mistake a I go. Thanks for all the support",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122be8650>,osr,1740615400.0

Leveling up in Grave,"So I picked up Grave and it looks really cool as I am planning to run a dark souls themed megadungeon/hexcrawl. However I cannot figure out how the leveling up works.

The book states '*While in a safe haven, a PC can gain a level by subsuming 1000 \** ***their current level in souls****, deducting these from the total carried indicated on their character sheet.*'

The bolded part is important, because I do not know how to interpret it.

Does it just means it is your current level \* 1000? That does not seem like a lot, and likely means the players will start leveling quite quickly if you do not tightly control how many souls they get per adventure.

Or does it mean if you want to go from level 2 to 3, it is 1000 \* 1000 as that is the amount of souls you spend up to now leveling up? Because that means the amount of exp you need goes up in orders of magnitude.

Is it one of these two methods, or am I overlooking something?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122b6c380>,osr,1740667977.0

Designing an Open Table Game für Teens,"Hello everyone. As the title says, I am working on a bigger project for a hopefully long-running campaign with (mostly) teens who may have never played a TTRPG before.

My plan is to put them in a strange land, where the people of the empire originated from long ago. The empire they come from is a colorful mix of people, where peace reigns and nothing interesting ever happens—so no adventure at home. The old world collapsed long ago, leaving only ruins, dungeons, and monsters. The players start as adventurers in a hostile world without any friendly civilization. They must explore and fight their way through the land to build something for themselves and maybe even become rulers of their own kingdoms.

For rules, I think I will use a mix of OSE and some other rules for domain-building mechanics.

So far, so good, but there are a few problems I am working on. I would like to evoke a feeling that lies somewhere between modern PC survival games like *Valheim* and old-school RPGs like *Daggerfall*. I tried to achieve that with BRP, but it seemed like too much work and tended to slow down character creation.

I have some house rules:

* **Shields** can be sacrificed to negate all damage from one attack. This must be announced before damage is rolled. Only magic shields can block magical damage, and they can do so one extra time for each + they have before breaking. Skilled crafters may repair magic shields.
* **Critical hits** deal maximum damage + level.
* **Max HP** at first Level
* **Stats** will be rolled with 4D6 drop lowest and can be freely distributed.
* **Critical failures** leave you off guard and grant your opponent a free attack.
* **Encumbrance** will be slot-based (from *Carcass Crawler*).
* **Thief skills** will be reworked (*also from Carcass Crawler*).
* **Clerics** get one spell at first level.
* **Magic Users** start with a staff that can store a level 1 spell. The staff can be upgraded at higher levels to hold more spells.
* **Read Magic** is no longer a spell but a skill that every Magic User has.
* **Death and Dying** is changed:
   * If a character falls to 0 HP, they fall unconscious and bleed out in 1d4 rounds.
   * The player rolls a save vs. death. If successful, the character gets another 1d4 rounds before dying.
   * Another character must reach them and spend one round administering first aid.
   * The character remains unconscious unless healed with magic.
   * After combat, they wake up after one turn with 1 + Con bonus HP.

"Integrating Wounds/Vitality to an OSE AD&D, Individual Wound Tracking, and Damage by Class - Thoughts After Returning to Old School Gaming after Many Years","I started playing a heavily OSE influenced version of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons for my nephews the other day, and of course imminently started to think about how I want to change up the game, and especially combat. And that is one the things I have really loved the most about getting into OSE. It feels like I am much closer to the game mechanics, allowing me to adapt them the way that I want.

I hosted a live discussion of all of this earlier today and had a fantastic discussion in that chat. I will put a link down below if you want to watch. But for now, here is a basic rundown of some of my thinking (and these are just notes to get me structured for more comprehensive formation of the ideas).

**Stamina & Wounds**

* Reintroduce the Vitality?Wound system similar to what was in the 3.5 Unearthed Arcana.
* **Stamina** absorbs damage first and recovers after a complete rest at a rate dependent upon the character’s Hit Die.
* **Wounds** represent real injuries and are tracked individually rather than as a pool.

**Attack Resolution & Damage Calculation**

1. Attack rolls need to be come less binary and less random. Going around the table and having everyone miss isn’t working for my game style. Long hit points grinds also does not fit my play style.
2. **Attack Roll:** Roll 1d20 + modifiers against the target’s AC. (Move from THAC0 to ascending AC)
3. Unified Attack and Damage Roll. Unified attack roll is inflicts damage according to  **(D20 + Weapon Damage Die) - Armor AC**
4. **I like Armor as Damage Reduction, but I am not sure how that will interact with a unified attack and damage roll, especially if armor provides a passive defensive bonus as well.** 
5. **Weapon Damage is based on character class rather than weapon. Weapons determine damage type and have other stats to differentiate them.** 
6. **Apply Damage:**
   * If the target has Stamina remaining, subtract the damage from Stamina.
   * If the target has no Stamina left, the damage is applied as a **Wound**.

**Wound Categories**

* **Wounds calibrated to a “Normal Man” having 6 Wounds.** Some characters may have a few more.

Wounds are categorized based on the damage of a single attack:

* **Light Wound (1-2 damage):** Superficial, mostly narrative.
* **Moderate Wound (3-4 damage):** Significant but not crippling. Likely to stop most “normal” combatants from fighting.
* **Major Wound (5-6 damage):** Very Likely fatal to a ""normal man"".
* **Grievous Wound (7+ damage):** Devastating and may imposes mechanical effects.

**Critical Hits:** Critical hits **bypass Stamina and Armor DR**, dealing direct Wound damage.

**Armor & Shields**

* **Armor provides Damage Reduction (DR) and a small AC bonus.**
* **Shields increase AC but do not provide DR.**

**Wound Cards & Injury Effects**

* Players **draw a Wound Card** when suffering a wound.
* Cards provide unique descriptions based on damage type (slashing, bludgeoning, fire, etc.).

**Healing & Recovery**

* **Stamina recovers after resting.**
* **Wounds require magical healing or extended rest.**
* Healing mechanics for Wounds will be determined separately.

I have seen that several people draw on the Vitality/Wound system. Has anyone implemented anything like any of these other elements? I am going to continue thinking about these in the coming days to see if I can codify at least some part to bring to the table with the nephew in the next few days.

Retainers in OSE,"I am reading through OSE to gear up for a megadungeon game and I noticed that in the retainers section there isn't really any division between retainers that fight (men-at-arms or similar) and then more menial positions like torchbearers and porters.

New adventure: ‘Serpent’s Sanctum’,"I’ve been working incredibly hard on this adventure, and am extremely happy to finally share this **40–page** module with you!

**’Serpent’s Sanctum’** is a System Neutral module: basic stats are supplied, and adapting it to any OSR, NSR, or Fantasy system should be a breeze.

Delve into the secret halls of an abandoned mausoleum! But tread carefully as you enter the halls – traps are abound. Within you may uncover the dark secrets – and even darker fate – of the grand wizard Sesvarin Odel and their unfortunate child Lyra. Try not to awaken the Mangled Undead, and do try to behave when meeting the proud Cave Dwellers.

**’’Serpent’s Sanctum** is available via my Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Undelved 
Please have a more in depth look at the release post: https://www.patreon.com/posts/release-serpents-123019651

*100 years ago, a mighty wizard & their child died in a tragic fire, thought to be the effect of a powerful curse. They were buried by local villagers in the wizard's secluded mausoleum. Thinking the curse might be lingering, the villagers feared the mausoleum & left it to weather & decay. Now, 100 years later, people are mysteriously disappearing from the village – and the locals seem to blame the old cursed mausoleum. But – is it really a curse, or has something else been lingering for all these years?*

The module is **40 pages** of dungeon delving, containing: 
- 2 entrances/exits.- 23 keyed areas.
- A full color isometric map.
- A mystery to be solved, and moral dilemmas to overcome.
- Hooks & rumours to get the PCs started.
- Traps & ambushes to avoid or overcome.
- 6 unique denizens to interact with, disturb, or avoid – All illustrated.
- A 'Treasure & Oddities' table with 1d20 hidden things in dark places.
- And much more. 

**Serpent's Sanctum** is designed as a 'classic' dungeon delving adventure, with a mystery as the main hook: villagers are disappearing, and no one knows why. A 'cursed' mausoleum is to blame according to some, while others blame the dangerous waters of a rapidly flowing river. The module is designed for curious players who like to indulge in dungeon delving: figuring out secret doors, solving traps in creative ways, and investigating this odd mystery. All of this of course ends climatically in a moral dilemma.

**Check out the adventure right here:** https://www.patreon.com/posts/release-serpents-123019651
Or buy it on Itch: https://undelved.itch.io/serpents-sanctum
(It’s ***cheaper*** to support my work on Patreon than buying the module on itch – just saying).

I really hope you’ll enjoy your time delving in **Serpent’s Sanctum**!

S&W Complete Revised + Supplements or OSE Basic+Advanced. Which do you prefer?,"I'm just curious really. I've been running Evils of Illmire in OSE for awhile now, 21 sessions and it's been a fantastic time. I'm still very curious in checking out Swords & Wizardry Complete Revised. Would love to hear why some people settled on S&W over OSE.

  
From what I see, I love the simple Saving Throw, that's already great. Not that it's difficult using the Saves from OSE/BX but the wording still trips me up sometimes. I like not having Race as Class without having to worry about the extra baggage of decoupling them. Not that it's difficult in Advanced or Carcass Crawler material but it's just extra work. I appreciate the wordiness of S&W, don't get me wrong I love how easy to use OSE is at the table but sometimes I really just want to know why something is the way it is without having to google it. 

  
As my Illmire campaign comes to a close, I've also been looking at more medium length megadungeons to run and I am seriously considering having my players check out S&W hence this post.

Random small scale treasure generation,"Hey everyone,

I'm working on a hexcrawl for an OSR game (Knave 2e), and I'm trying to figure out the best way to generate small-scale treasures—stuff that’s valuable but not game-breaking.

For example, in one of my hexes, there's a **tipped-over merchant's cart**, which was attacked by humanoid creatures. The attackers **took most of the supplies and the merchant**, but left **some valuables behind**. The idea is that people in the nearby settlement have noticed the merchant is missing, so the players might hear rumors about it.

However, I'm struggling with **what the treasure should actually be**. How much should it be worth? What kinds of items would make sense? I don't want it to be just 'a bag of gold'; I'd prefer something that fits the setting naturally.

Are there **any books, tables, or resources** you'd recommend for generating this kind of treasure? Specifically, things that fit a **low-fantasy, dark, weird setting**?

Any recommendations would be awesome! Thanks!""",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122c87950>,osr,1740607735.0

Yam-Shaped Campaigns,"I didn't create the idea, just thought it was worth spreading. 

A ""Yam-Shaped Campaign"" is ""narrow at the beginning and end but wide in the middle"". In other words, it has a clear beginning (possibly with clear goals) and one (or preferably, a few) explicit endings. However,  HOW and IF you'll get there is up to the PCs.

In 5e D&D, Tomb of Annihilation (ToA) and Curse of Strahd (CoS) are good examples. In B/X, my favorite is probably B10 Night's Dark Terror.

It is my favorite type of campaign.

A Hidden Fourth Core OD&D Class!?,"Recently, I've been looking into the ""anti-cleric,"" which is potentially sort of an unofficial fourth core class for the original version of D&D. It's never explicitly presented as another core player option, but it shows up in the text at different point.

In the description of Clerics, it states that Clerics of level 7 or higher are only Law or Chaos, suggesting that at that point they have to fully pick a side. That suggests a difference between Clerics of Law and Clerics of Chaos (though it's not clear how Neutrality Clerics fit into that, other than having to change alignment at level 7 or higher. In that case, would a 1st level Law or Neutrality Cleric be a normal Cleric while a Chaotic Cleric would be an Anti-Cleric? Potentially.

In the section on Turn Undead, Evil Clerics are specified to not be able to Turn Undead. 

As a side note, Evil and Chaos aren't the same thing, but in this version of the game, it does seem to be conflated. In fact, Evil High Priests appear in the Chaos category, suggesting that Chaotic Clerics are Evil and Evil Clerics are Chaotic. The full level title list is: Evil Acolyte, Evil Adept, Shaman, Evil Priest, Evil Curate, Evil Bishop, Evil Lama, Evil High Priest.

For spells, it states that certain Clerical spells ""are reversed."" The wording there isn't entirely clear; either Anti-Clerics *can* reverse certain spells, or they can only cast certain spells in reverse. The distinction is huge.

If you assume Anti-Clerics can only cast those spells in reverse, then this is their spell list:

1st: Cause Light Wounds (d6+1 dmg), Corrupt Food and Water, Detect Magic, Detect Good, Protection/Good, Darkness

2nd: Find Traps, Hold Person, Bane (-1 morale/-1 attack rolls for some turns), Speak with Animals

3rd: Remove Curse, Cause Disease, Locate Object, Continual Darkness

4th: Neutralize Poison, Cause Serious Wounds (2d6+2 dmg), Protection/Good (10', r.), Turn Sticks to Snakes, Speak with Plants, Create Water

5th: Dispel Good, Finger of Death, Commune, Quest, Insect Plague, Create Food

  
(I will note that some of the spells become awkward reversed; the cure wounds spells in particular are supposed to take a turn to use, so you'd only be able to reverse a cure spell outside of battle if you were tricking an NPC into taking damage instead of healing, which is much more niche)

  
What you have is a Cleric that goes from being an armoured warrior with support and healing magic to an Anti-Cleric who is a death priest spreading darkness and death. This Anti-Cleric is (potentially) dishing out damage on touch spells (maybe useful against high AC enemies), spreading darkness, poisoning and diseasing enemies instead of healing them, debuffing enemies with a reversed Bless, and at their zenith, outright killing enemies with a save or die Finger of Death.

  
Truth be told, I'm not certain how much it was intended for this to be a player option, if at all (though Clerics who reverse Raise Dead into Finger of Death and misuse can be turned into Anti-Clerics). The way the spells work when reversed suggests that they were maybe meant to sort of be NPCs who act like Clerics and maybe offer to provide services like Cure Wounds but trick you and reverse it, or enemy NPCs who drown out your light sources in the dungeon with Darkness (presumably being able to see in the dark due to being evil monsters).

However, I think it would be really cool to have this be a player option. Additionally, even though the book says they can't Turn Undead, I think it could be a super cool thing for them to ""reverse"" Turn Undead too and literally turn dead bodies into the undead (as in, raise corpses as their servants). There could be balance issues with that (especially since Animate Dead is a 5th level Magic-User spell), but I just think it would be so cool to have that contrast of good Clerics turning away or destroying legions of undead while evil Clerics raise them.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122d1aed0>,osr,1740518090.0
Good mechanic for mountain or cliff climbing?,"I've got a party crossing the sea to a location atop some broken cliffs with few routes of ascent. They've recently had a stay at a safe location where they were able to secure rope and hooks, though they don't yet know what they may need them for.

I was thinking of using mostly monsters that rely on touch, smell, hearing, and knowledge of the space to navigate in the dark, and to have PCs rely on it too if they want to be stealthy.

I would like to hear your ideas, methods, and resources you use to make stealth in the dungeon appealing, and how do you handle it in case of total darkness.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122d57290>,osr,1740492510.0

2) I am sure I can adjust the non spell casting classes to fit this setting, maybe not use all of them but most. Possibly renaming a few. How do you feel the Hyperborea classes fit a Hyborian setting?

3) Lastly, naturally I wouldn't be able to use Arcane and Divine spell casters from the book casting D&D based spells. I have no clue how to even do spells from caster classes in Hyboria. Anyone have any insight?

Alternate HP systems that are less abstract but not crunchy?,"Title says it all. I want a more tangible form of HP that isn't crunchy nor requires lots of math. 

There are other things that I need the system to fit in with. First, in my setting there is both magical healing and non-magical healing; I haven't ironed out the specifics but the limitation on magical healing is that it speeds up recovery but that wounds and injuries need to be treated with medicine, surgery, bones set, etc. in order for recovery to be sped up. This means I would prefer if the HP system also had some way of resolving for wounds and injuries.

Second, I am also going to be using a super simple form of hit locations because my setting has firearms (but it is not mandatory). So I would like some integration with that.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122d72d20>,osr,1740507210.0

Questions about the Nature of OSE,"Two questions I am trying to figure out:

A. How much magic is supposed to be in OSE? I have read through the rules and it says it takes a 9th level magic user 10,000gp and a full month to make 20 +1 arrows as an example crafting magic items WITHOUT having to go on a quest for rare magical ingredients. 

Additionally the rules state that a ruler can expect to make 10gp a year from each settler and assuming an insanely low 1% of income of any kind (for peasants it would typically hover between 10-20% in medieval England for instance) which would mean that it would cost the equivalent of 10 years of manual labor for 20 arrows with a minor buff would imply magic is very rare but after asking unrelated stuff people have mentioned that magic is supposed to be common in OSE so which is it?

B. Should I bother with a BBEG (big bad evil guy) or should I only focus on making interesting dungeons which from what I can tell lack a narrative but give the players a way to basically retire after getting a fiefdom.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122d8c950>,osr,1740522388.0
Lair of the Forgotten Queen - Made for the Shadowdark RPG - Kickstarter Live!,"Hey Dungeon delvers!

I have been having a ton of fun working on **Lair of the Forgotten Queen** and the Kickstarter is now live!!

This is my first time publishing an adventure (or rather, 4 adventures) and I would love your support to bring this project to life!

Plans for this smallish module designed for the Shadowdark RPG include:

* Four (4) dungeons in an easy to read outline format
* Associated maps (blank copy for VTT/players, room keyed for the GM)
* Minimum of 5 monsters, either unique or fun mutations of familiar classics
* Minimum of ~~3~~ 5 unique magic items
* Several minor NPCs with ties to the dungeons
* Rumors and adventure hooks to get the party started

The first 3 dungeons will be loosely linked together, ultimately leading to the 4 dungeon, the titular **Lair of the Forgotten Queen**. The idea is that this module can be used as a standalone adventure, or the way I'll likely use it, just dropping them into an existing game.

A little bit of story:

I would obviously love for for the Kickstarter to be successful, but even if it's not, I'm having a lot of fun, and I'll use the dungeons for my own game!

Give me OSR concepts world builders should address,"The title. Assuming the baseline fantasy or fiction is something between OD&D, BECMI and B/X, Im trying to come up with a list of concepts and questions that if you're writing for an implied setting, what are conceptual blind spots that need to be addressed and accounted for?

A couple of examples:

If you have a Catholic-esque religious organization, how do they politically view direct but magical (may include clerical, but assumed arcane) healing?

Specifically, who makes magic swords/armor/potions? What is the exact process of making them?

If a legal organization, such as a the city guard, acquires a wizard's spell book, what typically happens to it?

(Just about any question about most Monster Manual creatures)

Im not asking for answers to these questions. Only additional questions to answer for writers and worldbuilders to answer ourselves. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122dd8e00>,osr,1740433464.0

Rant about learning a complex game system instead of an OSR,"Hi, with my long time group (D&D 2e), we were having a talk about our next game system.

We are playing Stars Without Number (20th game in the campaign and it's great, enough crunch/customization IMO) just after many 10y+ with 5e. It's a good chance and 3/4 of the group love it.. Solo, I played with OSE, Olde Swords Reign and just started Shadowdark. 

My interest in 5e faded away a few years ago. Something was lost in the game and I discovered the OSR indie designers. Got 1 rule book, then many, and bough many adventures. I'm in a happy place.

Yesterday, someone asked to start a new campagin and play 5.5e after SWN.  
  
Since, I don't want to go back to 5.5e, I'm quite vocal. In short, as you probably, the game has too many rules/exceptions + rule lawers, combats are too long, we have uninspiring marvel super heroic abilities for every classes,  and we ended up with a table of power gamers that consulted guides on how to build the most perfect build.... the game becomes unbalance and it's a slog to play.  
  
The DM is listening to all of us and has the final say since he invests time in building the campaign. He wants the group to be happy and he is undecided. I know he enjoyed SWN. A few months ago, I DM a few games of Low Fantasy Gaming and showed them an alternative to 5e. But some players rely to much on the character sheet for abilities and are rule lawyer. They don't like SWN or LFW... and probably they won't like OSR nor Shadodark. This could sound harsh, but their imagination has been brainwased and marvelled by super heroic abilities.

Then, I realized that the DM for 5E has to stop to read/memorize the PHB (5e) and could not track anymore what abilities/feats are doing for everyone, and what is available/upcoming. Something that was never a problem with 1e/2e. Same with the spells, especially the news ones or variants.   
  
Same for my friends: Nobody knows how to play the other characters since they are too complex with all the choices after level 3 or something like that. Maybe one player has a juggernaut memory to remember all the rules, abilities, spells, good for him....

And it bothered me a lot: Why do we play a game where the DM cannot wrap is head around the classes and abilities? Is this a big deal, probably not but I added that to my stack of reasons why we should not bother with 5.5e.  
  
So, I have hard time understanding/convincing my group that 5e. You probably have experience with this since we are in the OSR channel...   
  
Yes, we could split the group since half wants to play SWN/WWN and the other half wants 5.5e. But I'm bothered by the fact that the 5e+ DM/players are not reading the PHB and still wants to play *that* game. I'm angry a little I guess that they could not see that the Without Number game is fun with less crunch and a few combat options... where rules are simple and that we call all enjoy our custom build with unique Talents/Focis and skills...

(argh!)

Minecraft as a VTT... crazy or not?,"This is something I'm seriously considering. 

The idea would be you'd use Minecraft to make locations, etc, in your world. Probably starting with at least just a town.

You'd use it as a visual reference for your players. Maybe you could put little ""boxed text"" notes in different places as you can do in Minecraft.

For dungeons, maybe you could could map it out and just use Minecraft as a visual reference. Again, boxed text could be used for features, traps, etc.

Plus, if you're using domain rules, your players could spend thousands of gold to build their very own castles and whatnot IN MINECRAFT.

I feel like that could be cool. I'll confess, I haven't played Minecraft for like a decade. I'm totally out of touch with it.

Sabre has added a ""Daily Deal"" feature, with each day giving one product we've got in stock a significant discount. We'll be rotating through a number of OSR and indie titles, both old and new. Right now probably the easiest way to find these deals is [**via our Discord**](https://discord.gg/VKpQj2PnZR).

* [**The Spires of Kuyyin**](https://alfalcon.itch.io/the-spires-of-kuyyin) is a short adventure written for Cairn 2e dealing with the exploration of ruins within a ice-covered canyon.
* Billed as a ""mini-mega dungeon"", [**The False Temple**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/azorynianpost/the-false-temple-an-osr-mini-mega-dungeon) is by the Azorynian Post. It's projected to have about 150 rooms when complete, and is for characters of levels 4-7. It's a bit of a gamble -- it's the creator's first project, and the project isn't 100% complete -- but they are just fulfilling it as a pdf, and previews of the dungeon are available for perusal. I'd like to see this project fund as I like to encourage small, first-time publishers who are dipping their toes into the business end of the hobby.
* Available as a 114-page, spiral bound book, [**Advanced Rules**](https://doctor-violet.itch.io/advanced-rules) is a compilation of supplemental material for Mothership, including some guidelines for solo play (someone was asking me about solo rules for Mothership a few weeks back).
* [**Mussel Beach: Volume 1**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/musselbeach/mussel-beach-volume-1) is described as a ""swole seafaring zine"". It's written for Meatheads, a game which sees occasional mention here, and is designed as part in-world magazine, part setting.
* Jaclyn Lewis is raising funds for [**Imagine Queer Worlds**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/janatee/imagine-queer-worlds), a guide to designing worlds and settings that do not hew to traditional gender and romantic assumptions.

Reed's got an enviable track record of both publishing material but also running successful crowdfunding campaigns, so I'm sure this zine has a lot of useful information in there.
* Probably one of the most interesting ZiMo projects I've seen thus far this year is [**Wiki Articles are Wizards \[citation needed\]**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/periaptgames/wiki-articles-are-wizards-citation-needed), a zine about generating weird and unusual wizards from wiki articles.

* [**Chive Knight**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/512584/chive-knight?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473) is a delightful looking OSR system inspired by jrpg art and games.

"OSE Oriental Adventures, the Hwarang - the first of the Korean inspired classes","Hello again! I am making general progress with OA conversion, and after making my history homework, I am introducing the first of the Korean inspired classes: The Hwarang! The Pretty Boy turned Warrior Scholar of the Silla dynasty!

Oh boy, where do I begin! This is one of my absolute favorite classes I’ve worked on, right up there with my Psionicist and the Astromancer. Not only because of the fun I had while studying it, but also because of the way Its design ended up as. Shoutout to Guy Larke Jr. for reaching out and giving his feedback, you really helped me in giving the right direction for my research.

Anyway, back to the class! The Hwarang were a group of elite warriors trained in social elite youth clubs in the Silla Kingdom between the 6th and 10th centuries. At this time the Korean peninsula was divided among three Kingdoms: Silla, Goguryeo and Baekje, with one of the kings of Silla ordering the creation of an elite warrior order trained under Buddhist principles with complete loyalty to the country, so they started recruiting young men from multiple social groups led by noble aristocrats. The story of their creation is more detailed and interesting, but you get the idea, these are, to find a western equivalent, knights through and through, but according to the sources I found, they were also given education in multiple disciplines, from Bhuddist philosophy by monks themselves, to education in musical arts, philosophy, rethoric, strategy and even poetry! 
This gave me a chuckle, as apparently the Koreans have Kpop pretty boys in their cultural dna since their foundation, and I am all for it.

Design wise I was tempted to have them as a Knight variant from OSE advanced fantasy, but after reading the many sources available the more I realized something, these guys are the closest thing to a Paladin I have ever seen, even the Paladins themselves! So I went with that route.

The Hwarang are fighters trained in bhuddist techniques and philosophy. I didn’t mentioned the bhuddism part, but they are trained in self healing, and like Paladins, they develop the use divine magic, or in this case, the use of Spirit arts from the monk class I made a while ago. They also have a minor variant of bardic inspiration, not to charm enemies but to boost allies in battle, all thanks to their gravitas and education. In exchange for these abilities, they have to follow a strict code of conduct, or five commandments, which I put explicitly as they actually were, so if you are playing a Hwarang, you have to follow these, just as the Paladin’s oath.

The reason I loved how it turned out is ls how well it’s fitting within the framework I’ve made so far, and a Fighter variant class with the monk powers that is also supoorted by actual historical records is something I deeply love, I’d actually play it, I am telling you.

In any case, this is what I have so far, I’ll gladly take your feedback and hope you’ll find them useful on your table as well. I’ll keep on working on the next issue of Appendix L (please get issues 1 and 2 on drivethrurpg!) while I do my research for the next classes, which will be Korean inspired demi-humans from mythology.

A newish(???) random encounter mechanism?,"My starting point was that a party of 10 PCs and hirelings jingling with a load of armour or treasure should attract more attention than a couple of sneaky halflings.

I know that the standard 1/6 roll every two turns already takes encumbrance into account by slowing the party's move speed and giving them more encounter rolls for a given distance travelled. But my own system doesn't reduce exploration speed for encumbrance. 120' every 10 mins is already pretty slow and in general I want parties to make slightly faster progress than in B/X.

Meanwhile, the standard system actually gives large parties slightly fewer encounters than small parties, as the extra manpower means they can e.g. search rooms faster. That feels wrong to me. If you enter a dungeon with 20 guys, you should attract attention pretty fast imo. Generally, my system slightly discourages the use of a lot of hirelings because I want to reduce the extra cognitive and admin load on players of managing multiple characters.

So this is what I've got:

* As normal, roll a check every two turns. On a 1, an encounter occurs.
* However, you don't necessarily roll a d6. To work out what die to use, calculate: 14 - # party members - # party members heavily encumbered (ie heavily encumbered people count double). Add 1 for each Thief or Halfling in the party.
* Finally, round the result down to the nearest die size. It can't go below a d2 (ie a coin toss).

So a party of two unencumbered PCs rolls a d12. A party of four unencumbered PCs rolls a d10. A party of four heavily encumbered PCs rolls a d6. A party of six, four of whom are heavily encumbered, rolls a d4.

If I was applying this to eg B/X, with its slower movement speeds for encumbered characters, I'd remove my die size adjustment for the number of encumbered party members.

Wdyt? I'd be surprised if something identical (or at least very close) hadn't been proposed before but I haven't seen it myself.

\*EDIT"" Forgot an important part of the system! As in the standard system, you make an extra roll when the party does something particularly noisy. But in that case you always roll a d6, because one fighter breaking down a door is just as noisy as three doing it.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122e6ff20>,osr,1740407932.0

How to play with high AC/high health players?,"I have been running an OSE campaign for a few months now and some of the players have started reaching level 3-5 and I am not sure how to make combat as scary as they rarely get one shot and they often have more ways to stay alive which is making combat a little dull. Additionally at least two of my players have AC or 0 or lower and because of this they are acting much more reckless in combat and are especially in narrow areas preventing anyone in the party from being in any danger which again is making combat feel riskless and with magic being quite uncommon 99% of things the players will fight don't have any reasonable way of hurting them without a crit.

Edit: Thanks for the great advice I didn't realize that magic was supposed to be that common in OSE I figured it cost thousands and thousands of coins for a high level magic user to enchant something so it would be very hard to find magic.

How to draw player-facing dungeon maps?,"Hi, guys!

I would like to draw a dungeon map I could reveal to my players during our game as their characters explore it. However, I don't want to spoil the surprise by revealing the entire map I drew beforehand.

One solution I came up with is to draw an in-world sketch of the dungeon, that's deliberately vague and incomplete. 

The other solution I came up with is to draw a fairly detailed map and then cover it with another piece of paper. Then, I would reveal the dungeon one room at the time as my players explore it.

Yes, my players could draw a map themselves using my description, but I find that process slow and tedious so I'm trying to come up with alternatives.

How would you draw a player-facing dungeon map? Do you have any examples, either your own or from published modules? I could really use them for ideas and inspiration!

You only gain a point of Conviction when following your conviction gets you into trouble."" Does that mean you have either 1 point of Conviction or none? There's not accumulation, just 1 or 0? I don't get how that's to be used. Thanks for any insights. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122ea0740>,osr,1740334599.0

The great search for Magic (System),"I discovered the OSR some 2 years ago. Or rather, I discovered the OSR some 4 years ago, misunderstood it as ""the style of play where game master kills PCs for sports"", thought it was stupid, and rediscovered it some 2 years ago, and fell in love with the philosophy of play it presented. Trying to dip my feet rather than dive head first, I decided to give DCC a shot, as it felt like something close enough to what I was used to, while being different enough to hopefully offer the experience I was looking for. The system was pretty standard up until the chapter that forever changed my perception of fantasy systems - Magic.

I do not lie when I say it was groundbreaking experience, however silly that may sound. Spells not only capable of failing, but also with varying results! Finally, something that speaks to my post-soviet-Europe neuroticism - magic that can harm the person who wields it. Spells straight up broken, capable of putting entire cities to sleep, being cast at great cost and risk. Magic that felt magical, dangerous, tempting. Up until we used it in practice, and looking up results on the table kept killing my vibe over, and over again. I ended up writing tl;dr versions of spells my players rolled, so that we could actually use them on the fly. I love you Goodman Games, but you cannot convince me that you don't pay your writers per word.

But much like characters in my campaign discovering the forgotten texts, my eyes have been opened. And I started the search for my own Magic. I was looking for a game with magic system where magic is powerful and dangerous. Ideally, it would be a system where magic feels like ""a messed up science project"". There were some problems.

I will not go into all of these systems because, first of all, I don't remember details and I would hate to misrepresent those systems, and second of all, this is my first long text on this sub and I feel like I am already overstaying my welcome. (Ironic, considering how insanely long this post have become).

My search has led me to well known RPG titles, and titles I've never heard of before. On top of normal Vancian magic and DCC twist on it, there was The Book of Gaub. There was magic system from Call of Cthulu and Ars Magica. There were magic systems from titles that are not what OSR games are usually about. I would call all of them a ""DM Magic"". Not because players can't use it, but rather because most of these systems work really well in the hands of a scheming villain, rather than in hands of PC. Well, PCs who are trying to survive in a dungeon or travel through perilous wilderness. I'm sure many people enjoyed the hell out of these in the right playstyle. Here the effects were either too niche or casting time too great for it to be a tool for foolish adventurers.

There were some interesting twist on Vancian magic system, Knave would tax your inventory for example. I liked that. It wasn't enough, but I liked that.

There was forbidden lands, where you spend metacurrency and roll to see if shit goes sideways. The metacurrency you'd accumulated by going above and beyond to the point of dealing yourself damage (kinda). It had good ideas, but metacurrencies, and especially the way that particular metacurrency is accumulated in Forbidden Lands simply doesn't vibe with me. Plus it promotes strange decision making  where the mage is pushing rolls they already succeeded on to damage themselves to be able to cast spells. It sounds way cooler when I wrote it down, and it really gives the vibe of ""this strange guy who does crazy shit for no reason, but we keep him around because he can cast fireballs"", so let me assure you - that's not how it felt at the table.

I even looked at more story-driven games. Trophy Gold had some cool ideas where just by virtue of being capable to cast spell you were more likely to, well, die as you'd start the adventure with less HP (I'm sure I'm not getting any brownie points from Trophy Gold fans by calling it HP, but whatever). Plus, casting a spell always represented a danger. I liked that. It simply wasn't what I was looking for.

Aot of you are screaming at the monitor ""why hasn't he just made his own system at this point?!"". Fair point, but I simply could not believe that no one ever has made a system that would convey the vibes I was trying to go for. Extreme power at extreme risk. I mean, for fuck sake, this is the most basic ""Grimm Brothers fantasy"" idea of magic there is!

And then I found it! Not perfect, but good enough. And I cannot tell you how much I love the ""good enough"". The damn GLOG magic. We now go all in on the glazing, so if you want a tl;dr, if I could recommend one magic system everyone should look into it would be the GLOG magic system.

Where do I begin? First of all, perhaps I begin by saying that I fucking love that the best idea for an alternative magic system I ever came across comes from a random BLOG of all places. A random blog I found while googling ""GLOG magic"" after finding it's hack on Cairn website. Also, it is 2025, it was 2024 when I first discovered it. A BLOG?! These still exist?! You can tell me that Goblin Punch is hardly a random blog, but let's be real - OSR is a niche subgenre of a niche hobby. And I don't think Goblin Punch is known by everyone who is into OSR, so yeah - it's a random blog. A random blog I now love and support.

The long story short of the GLOG magic is this - you have a pool of dice. You decide how much (max 4) you invest into a spell you want to cast. You then roll these dice, each having 50/50 chance of being refunded, otherwise they are expended. Once you reach zero dice in your pool you need to rest before you cast anymore spells. The more dice you invest, the more powerful the spell. This is already nice, but the cool part is the mishaps and the dooms.

The mishap happens when you roll two of the same number, and the doom happens when you roll three of the same number. Mishaps are annoying and potentially dangerous but manageable consequences, but dooms are going to mess you up. The third doom your PC experiences kills (or worse) your character. So for example, the first doom you get might be that something flammable around you spontaneously catches fire. A foreshadowing of thing to come. Your second doom might set your clothing or your spellbook on fire. Your third doom leaves nothing but a pile of dust in the place where your character once stood. Of course, you can quest for a way of saving yourself.

You will notice - as long as you keep rolling only one dice, you are safe. When you roll two, there is some shit that might go sideways, and when you roll 3 or 4 shit is likely to go sideways, and might even bring some more shit while doing so. And the more dice, the more powerful the spell. THIS IS PEAK FUCKING DESIGN. The power is always there, at your fingertips. Are you willing to reach for that power? Are you desperate or dumb enough?

What do I do with it? Well, this system is very hackable, and I added two things to it. First of all, the bullshitting, aka modifying your spells. The way it works in my games is, you can tell me what you want your spell to do that it feels like it could. So, let's say you can cast telekinesis. I can see how the same spell could allow you to create kind of a forcefield that stops all nonliving matter for some time. I eyeball how different the effect is from the original spell and tell my players that they can do that, if they roll extra dice for that spell (use a different color). Those dice do not affect the power of the spell and are used to represent the mage crafting the spell of the fly based on his reality bending abilities. Otherwise they act like normal spell dice. Broken? Yeah, totally! Fun? Oh hell yeah! Plus, all the more opportunities for those sweet, sweet dooms.

The second thing is, that while a wise wizards spend years to study old tomes and only cast spells they feel they are reasonably competent with, the foolish adventurers have no time for that! You found the spell scroll, you spend an evening, you want to cast your damn spells. Great! You can quick-learn spells, and when you cast spells you quick-learned, you add three extra dice to that spell roll, on top of dice already invested. Again, these do not affect the spell power, use different color and so on. Each time you do cast that spell you remove one extra die you need to add to the spell roll. This represents the risk of eyeballing the spell. Even weak version can backfire terribly when you don't know what you're doing.

I do not joke when I say that this magic system has been something that brought back my love for magic in ttRPGs. I was so close to trying a game with no magic whatsoever to at least avoid the disappointment. If you have been looking for a magic system that is different and feels like magic please, give it a (one)shot.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122ec9d60>,osr,1740231908.0
