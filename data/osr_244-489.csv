1f3scds,"B/X is so intuitive, I don't have to really ""prep"" anymore session to session.  ","To be clear, it was a lot of work before the game started.  I run Jacob Fleming's OSE modules with two groups on roll20, and before the first sessions I  uploaded all the maps (world, dungeon, and some wilderness encounters), as well as monster and npc tokens I would maybe need for several sessions. 

But now all I have to do is just roll encounters before a game.  It's all up to the players entirely on where to go and what to do.  I get to use my brain power during the session to run monsters during encounters and describe what's happening.  

No more laying down ""track"" of where players can go or trying to predict their movements.  Oh, you want to abandon the town under siege and go off into the mountains to go hunting?  Sure, you have the rations?  

No more fretting over balanced encounters.  Players  (mostly) approach the world and encounters with extreme caution because characters can actually die. I get to just enjoy listening to them strategize on what to do.  

No more DC nonsense. Roll under for an ability or over for a save.  Me and the players just decide when it's necessary, and often times it isnt unless its stated.  

Dungeon and wilderness exploration is guided by clear cut procedures. 

Combat procedures, in particular, ensure encounters are strategic and dramatic. No three hour slogs.  Characters die, but nothing ever seems unfair or contrived.  

No more thinking of mission hooks.  At first it was gold the players were after to level up, but over time the players, not me, built the story based on their actions.  Treasure is still a top priority, though.  

At the end of a session all I do is make a couple of notes on how the players actions may influence the world, record some of their ideas about what they think is happening and then, before next session roll up a few more encounters.  

I know this whole new dnd book is releasing this month, but I loathe the idea of having to go back and building the game while I'm driving it.  

After a year and half of play on my last 5e campaign I was totally burnt out and frustrated.  After a year and half of play on my OSE campaigns (plural) we are going strong and can't wait for the next session.  

I know I'm preaching to the choir with this but dang, coming B/X OSE was the best decision I ever made in the hobby.   It is a truly remarkable ttrpg system.

Hope you all are having a good time in your games too.  Thanks for reading.  ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c2267b0>,osr,1724900711.0
1di0qn6,My most disappointing Kickstarter that filfilled,"So, I know there was a thread discussing people's disappointment with it's systems, but I just received my Knave 2e physical copy, and man, I'm just so underwhelmed.

I'll mention that I've been running Knave 2e for a few months using the backer pdf, and really enjoying it. I was really looking forward to the book being at the table.

And now that I have it, all I can think is, ""Why was this $50?"" I back quite a few projects. I'm aware that this project is a little smaller than some others, but Andrew Kolb didn't even crowdfund and has made 2 books with 10x the content for less money.

I don't think there was any desire to overcharge, I think this was just bad contract negotiations by people who didn't know what they were doing. I know there's not much point in venting, but I honestly think this experience will make me less likely to back small projects moving forward, which is a shame.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c26c950>,osr,1718637809.0

Some time ago we talked about the dungeon as a narrative tool, even if it wasn't born with this purpose we've seen in it a perfect design to guide players through an interactive narrative system which exist just on paper and in the theatre of mind.

So I wanted to ask you what are your patterns while building a dungeon, what your purpose and what you think about this theory. I'm very curious about different opinions and several ways to think at the dungeon as a tool to play with others and sharing the same story.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c2bbb00>,osr,1735811579.0

I'll post a paragraph from the conclusion section but I highly suggest that you read the whole thing, if you're interested in Knave 2e:

> Knave (unlike BX) feels the same way to me; it isn’t an actual, stand-alone game that can play OSR modules. It doesn’t bother to define things like what melee combat are, and doesn’t have a bestiary or magic item list. I need other, actually complete and self-contained OSR books to use Knave. I find that frustrating.

1fe9qcw,3D6 Down The Line & Arden Vulgaris in Arden Vul - Observations on playstyles,"Like many here, I'm a big fan of the [3D6 Down The Line podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@3D6DTL) (""3D6"" from now on). I've also recently stumbled over the [Arden Vulgaris podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@EricVulgaris/videos) (""AV"" from now on) which I greatly enjoy (but be warned that the production quality is lower). Since they are both running the *Arden Vul* megadungeon, I find it interesting to compare the styles and discuss. Note that both GMs (Jon for 3D6, Eric for AV) are highly skilled and do an impressive performance. I thought I post some observations I made listening to them and comparing them, if anyone wants to chime in and discuss then I'm happy for all input!

(Obviously everything below is my own opinion. I've tried to avoid spoilers for *Arden Vul*.)

**Same players vs. open table**  
3d6 sticks with the same players, AV has an open table where anyone(?) can join, but many players are reoccurring. You definitely get more connection with the 3D6 players (they having better mic quality helps as well). The open table format makes it so that Eric forces all the AV sessions to start and end at a safe space. I never thought this would work when I started watching since 3D6 frequently gets stuck underground on major delves for >10 sessions, but it works great in practice which is pretty impressive. This also makes the in-game time move faster in AV which I like, 3D6 crams so much action into a few weeks that it sometimes feels unbelievable to me.

Overall I'm very impressed by the AV campaign (but it may just be that it's new and fresh for me) and it really shows that it's possible to run an open table using its methods.

**Canon**  
Both GMs stay close to Arden Vul as it's written, but they sometimes stray. Eric is a bit more liberal with the source material, sometimes changing stuff for no clear reason (as far as I can see). Jon has a tendency to ""amp up"" powerful enemies into unbeatable forces-of-nature, which I don't enjoy at all, but it doesn't happen that often so I can live with it. Erics changes are more often ""minor"" and tend to benefit the players and give them information or point them in the ""right"" direction. Both GMs tend to stray when the players go in an unexpected direction and find complicated rooms they haven't prepped, which is totally understandable. Both tend to retcon things from time to time, which is also understandable and they both do it fairly and elegantly IMO.

**Random encounters**  
Random encounters in 3D6 are pretty rare. I think this matches the rates in the adventure. In AV, random encounters seem to happen all the time. I thought this would kill the pace but I found myself enjoying it: the encounters are often optional or avoidable. I like how Eric frequently has wandering monsters block an entrance to the dungeon, which forces the players to change their plans and go explore somewhere else (which works since Arden Vul has so many places to explore). Overall it really makes the setting come alive.

**Information**  
Both GMs are very generous with information such as rumors, finding secret doors etc. compared to my interpretation of OSE as written. Eric goes one step further and has Thieves find secret doors and traps basically for free, often without even specifying that they are looking. Both approaches work: the 3D6 approach feels more fair but it's fun to watch the AV party gorge themselves on secrets.

**Pace**  
3D6 is more traditional, having the players do more of the ""OSR pixelbitching"" (for lack of a better term). Jon is very good at describing every detail of an encounter, even parts that may seem inconsequential or unimportant. But sometimes Jon puts down his foot and say ""there's nothing here"" or similar when the players get stuck trying to analyse the window dressing. AV is more ""railroady"" in a sense, Eric frequently tells the players conclusions they can make, he quickly skips through a couple of rooms to get them to where they're going, and he can hint very strongly at what the players ""should"" do next. I think AV kind of overdoes it, but I understand the need since the sessions need to end at a safe place. The higher pace also makes AV progress a lot faster: the party explores more and meets more NPCs than what 3D6 does in a similar time. The 3D6 approach is better even though I feel like its players sometimes forget that they are too ""high level"" to get stuck in ""low level"" problems that they have brute force solutions to. Game time is the most valuable resource IMO.

**Time wasters**  
Both podcast have an issue where pretty boring or inconsequential fights take too much time for my liking. The table might spend 30 minutes rolling dice to end up with five dead baboons and some wasted spell slots. AV also has the Luck resource from Shadowdark and a whole minigame around managing it (especially if any PCs are playing the Sage class). Even if it only takes a few minutes each session it eats table time and focus for no real benefit to the game IMO.

**Sunk costs**  
I'm impressed by how often AV players lose major magic items without much concern to try to retrieve them. AV players also use consumables much more liberally than the 3D6 party. The 3d6 players are more ""traditional"" and tend to hoard their resources and be very miserly about losing anything (often spending lots of table time to prevent the loss of some resource they could have found twice the amount of by continuing their delves). I think the difference is caused by the open table nature that makes players less attached to their stuff and characters, and more willing to take risk for great gain. I think good advice to players is to play in the AV style: use your resources, take risks and know that there's always more of the good stuff so don't be afraid to use it. 

**Story (spoilers ahead)**  
>!It's very interesting to see how both parties go down similar roads: Both hate the halflings and invest disproportionate resources into their destruction. Having NPCs that are obnoxious and take the players stuff really does aggravate them even if it's only a minor annoyance in the grand scheme of things. Both end up allying with the goblins. Makes sense since the goblins are accessible and not-obviously-evil, but it seems like the Settites or the Beastmen could fill a similar role in other campaigns. The beastmen are treated completely differently, likely because the first encounter in AV was hostile but 3D6 was non-hostile. First impressions really do matter.  !<",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c4001d0>,osr,1726060186.0
1jby5ie,Dark & Darker - a video game you can check if you need to scratch that itch,"I've recently come across this game called **Dark and Darker** and gave it a go when I wanted to play video game with old-school dungeon delving theme. 

You basically choose a class, get your starting gear and delve into a dungeon you explore and loot. You keep a map of the dungeon of areas you visit, you have a torch and all that jazz, and chests which you can check in, merchants, etc.  

I've raided (unsuccessfully and died) a Goblin Cave by myself --but it supports co-op so that's also possible. It's free-to-play for now so no harm in trying, if you're looking for something to scratch that itch. It's still in early access so beware.

First impression is that it can be a good way to get your dose, when you cannot play tabletop.

You can get the game for free on Steam - https://www.darkanddarker.com/

1es0v0q,Kinda annoyed trying to convert 5e stuff to Deathbringer,"I have Professor Dungeon Master's Deathbringer. I've decided to finally run a one shot with it. I really like the premise and think the classes are very cool. I'm behind it.

It doesn't provide any spells, but instead encourages you to pick them from 5e or apparently any OSR game. That's fine; I don't mind the idea of customizing what spells to use. I go through the 1st level 5e spells and pick 8 for a d8 starting spell table (5e is the resource I have access to/knowledge of). So far, so good.

Then I go to pick monsters, and I realize the problem here. He encourages you to pick monsters from 5e or OSR games with the caveat of not applying CON bonuses to their HP to better match HP in Deathbringer.

Big problem: 5e's monsters aren't made with the same assumptions of Deathbringer! In fact, I can't be entirely certain on what all those assumptions are. First level Deathbringer characters range from 1-10 starting hit points, so I figure generic grunt monsters probably should have d6 HP. Maybe. That doesn't really align with the monster design and hit dice math behind 5e monsters, though. Even a mere goblin has 2d6 (if you ignore the CON bonus as he suggests).

This tracks with armor class, where I don't really know what a reasonable armor class for a monster to have. I can guess, but that's not that reassuring. Same for attack bonuses.

I'm thinking maybe I'll try running 5e monsters out of the box as he suggests, with no CON bonuses to HP or bonus actions, and they will just tonally be much tougher for this gritty world than they are in 5e. That fits what he's going for, I guess.

Overall, I like what he's going for with Deathbringer, and it seems like a great bridge to the OSR for 5e-firsters like me. I just can't help but think that this product makes a lot of assumptions about the experience and competency of the DM running it (not to besmirch myself or anything, but I'm really not confident homebrewing monsters for a system I'm new to). And I'm kinda doubtful of how smoothly 5e content can be converted into it.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c444f20>,osr,1723640093.0

1ibkfsv,Crowns 2e,"I just had the opportunity to play [Crowns 2e](https://ward-against-evil.itch.io/crowns-2e) with the author Ward Against Evil.

In short, it was fun, and I'm going to back it. Lighter than OSE, with more interesting crunch than lighter games (Knave, Cairn). I never played the first edition, but 2e has changed in some significant ways according to the author, and it was easy to pick up and play, as I literally downloaded the quickstart minutes before we began playing.

Character creation was a matter of minutes and lead to an interesting PC that was easy to slip into and play. We played entirely theater of the mind (first time in a while for me if I'm honest) and it was super simple and engaging. Combat was fast, interesting (very interesting), and horrifying. And the taste of other systems (advancement, trophies, downtime, etc.) was very cool.

I'm excited to see this one develop, and hope to playtest it again in the near future with more players.

As a side note, the adventure we were playing was [Blood Honey](https://wuggy.itch.io/bloodhoney) originally for Cairn I believe, and it is, from what I experienced, very well done.

I’ve been testing Shadowdark for 3 sessions for now and I miss some stuff from other systems and dislike some little points about the game:

-Magic roll is frustrating for the players, mainly for the reason that it is just their pure modifier to roll. Other systems (like DCC) have other resources to increase the casting chance, Shadowdark does not despite the talent increase.

-Specific wandering monsters tables (by level and terrain as OSE) and number appearing. The how many section is oversimplified and may cause strange balance on encounters.

-Some “monsters” also have to roll for their spells + the players DC to save as well. So there is a double chance that the death ray from the archmage fail. 1 DC to cast and another one in players DC to avoid it.

-Distance nomenclature is not that useful.

# ADVENTURE REVIEW: OPERATION UNFATHOMABLE

**Author/Publisher:** Jason Sholtis/Hydra Cooperative

**System:** Swords & Wizardry

**Level Range:** 1-2? Or maybe a bit higher? Nothing is balanced anyways.

# THE PITCH

You and your party are press-ganged into searching for a lost prince of an evil empire who has run off into the underworld with a powerful magical artifact seeking glory. You’ll follow his trail into the chaotic underdark to retrieve the artifact and hopefully earn your freedom.  

# CONTEXT

I bought this years ago and it’s been sitting on my shelf forever. My group just finished our Tunnel Goons campaign “Retro Rascals” and we weren’t ready to go back to straight up ‘vanilla fantasy’ yet. So, as a transition we finally busted out Operation Unfathomable. Was played at my kitchen table using a heavily house ruled OSE. It took us four sessions of about 3-4 hours each to finish. Shorter than expected but in a good way!

# PREP TIME

I’ve had this book on my shelf and read it in bits and pieces a lot over the last few years without having played it. The book is well-organized for at-the-table reference, with separate sections for random events, location descriptions, bestiary, magic items, etc. 

The process for rolling random encounters is more complex than a lot of modules. The book contains 44 detailed random encounters divided into separate tables for “Underworld Phenomena”, “Competing Parties & Underworld Travelers”, and “Wandering Horrors.” This is a GOOD thing because the encounters are richly-described and contain loads of world-building and gonzo experiences for players. But, I found it best if I pre-rolled a bunch of encounters before we came together at the table since it required a couple of rolls and a fair bit of reading and flipping to sort out what was happening. If I rolled and read the encounters in advance it made things flow much more smoothly at the table. 

The map is interesting and has icons built into it to indicate common environmental things like piles of debris and fungus gardens that have their own tables and procedures attached to them. I found it easy to describe the size of caves and general details to players so that they could navigate. The location descriptions are similarly fun and gonzo but can be wordy. It’s usually something I don’t like but it was worth it in the case of Operation Unfathomable because the locations and happenings were so gonzo and creative!

# AT THE TABLE

From the start this adventure grabs hold of you and pulls you in with crazy sights, ridiculous creatures, compelling side quests, and deadly encounters! I’ve never played such a bonkers but ultimately coherent and well-conceived dungeon.

It’s a bit wordy and that can slow things down sometimes but it’s absolutely worth the time you’ll take to read ahead and prepare.

Players were constantly engaged with interesting risks and weird and interesting situations. They knew enough to hide or run for their lives from some of the incredibly dangerous wandering monsters. Pushing buttons resulted in enough positive and cool outcomes early on that they were keen to experiment and take risks. 

The dungeon map has loads of different ways to travel around, lots of loops, and useful landmarks for players to orient themselves. I printed the way simplified player map that comes with the book and it was useful to get the players started on their exploration. I bookmarked the GM map in the book and it was very useful and well-labeled. 

The book is organized in a very effective way so you can flip through at the table and find what you need pretty easily. The pictures and artwork in the book are phenomenal and hilarious: you’ll want to show them to your players to set the tone and have a laugh together!

# OLD SCHOOL VIBES

Operation Unfathomable definitely brings the Old School vibes. Players are immediately thrust into action way over their heads and the pressure stays on. Even though the situations are unbalanced and seemingly unfair, players get a hold of a lot of powerful magic items and tools that they can use to more than even the odds: even for a party of first level players! 

Not all the encounters are combat-related! In fact, more than often players will have the chance to talk their way out of trouble or just have interesting and fun interactions with the denizens and visitors to the underworld that they will meet. 

The setting is the best-realized gonzo-style old school that I’ve played. Law & Chaos factor in as concepts (but not in any high-falootin’ way); psychic mushroom scientists offer mutation inducing fungus spores for players to experiment with; time-travelling humanoid animals seek to prevent the future apocalypse; and a cult of headless remote-controlled worshippers form a political alliance with a 50-foot long chaos godling worm. This barely scratches the surface of the insanity this module contains. But it somehow ‘makes sense’ in the context of the setting. It’s special.

# TREASURE AND LOOT

I don’t recommend inserting this module into an existing campaign: there’s a good chance that the magic items and loot that your players will find will be game-breaking in your normal campaign.

At the start of the mission players are provided with a stockpile of scrolls, exploding swords, amulets and other magic items to assist them in their quest. As the adventures unfold the party will have access to powerful magic items. In the context of Operation Unfathomable this is a strong positive: the magic items help to balance the scale and give players the chance to actually survive and impact the environment. In addition to physical items, there are loads of opportunities for characters to mutate themselves to gain interesting and OP special abilities and attacks. 

The exploding Sword of Demolition +1 was instrumental in ‘softening up’ a chaos godling when it was used as a suppository. Later, the godling was ultimately defeated when the Wooly Nelson, the Wooly Neanderthal player character, climbed into the worm sultan’s behind and used his newfound fungus-induced ability to explode into magical blue flame to finish the job.

WARNING! Early in one of the first sessions my players encountered science fungoids who repaid the party with Antipersonnel Puffball Fungi as a reward for being guinea pigs in their mutating experiments. This wasn’t without risk: one of the PCs erupted with spores and died immediately. However,  in hindsight I handed out too many (just enough?) of the Antipersonnel mushrooms as a reward. The players used these to massively turn the tide in numerous encounters with overwhelming numbers of baddies. They are very powerful and maybe should be handed out sparingly.

# MONSTERS AND FACTIONS

I don’t think there are any vanilla monsters in this entire module! Every encounter, every NPC, every wandering monster is unique to the setting and the majority are unique in each pre-designed encounter. The sheer overwhelming creativity that Jason Sholtis unleashes in this adventure is unbelievable. There are very few other modules that cram so much creativity and gonzo bliss into so few pages. To me, this is singular Old School D&D genius. 

You’ve got noble hybrid animal-fungi creatures from an alternate dimension called Blind Antler Men; headless remote controlled cultists of Null; slugman merchants; worm soldiers, an infant chaos godling named Thrantrix the Ineffable whose body is made of millions of writhing snakes, an immortal red-furred giant grieving its lost mate, mind bats, segmented giant underworld janitors, ancient beetle ghosts, and more . . . so much more.

# TRAPS AND PUZZLES

Finding the lost prince and the magical artifact proved a fun challenge. His shenanigans left a trail of corpses that the players were able to follow for a distance and many of the encounters with underworld NPCs provided additional clues and breadcrumbs. The map didn’t have any traps of the traditional variety. However, there are loads of buttons to push, mushrooms to munch, and risk-reward scenarios for players to monkey around with that can provide fantastic and powerful boons or crippling or fatal outcomes for the players. 

At the end of the module my surviving player characters were forever changed! One turned into a humanoid mushroom with telepathic communication abilities. Another had his eyes turn golden and gained the ability to detect good/evil and magic at will. One PC and many NPC retainers met all kinds of hilarious and horrible ends as they experimented with the flora, fauna, and artifacts they discovered. 

# GM CHALLENGES

Like I mentioned earlier, the drawback to having well-detailed and interesting encounters is that there is a lot to read before you can get rolling with some of them. Most sessions I rolled in advance to select the encounters so I’d be better aware of what was going to happen. The session I didn’t I felt rushed and having to read first then describe to players slowed things down. No one complained, but it was harder for me. 

Other than that, the module is really easy to play and run. The encounters are absolutely mental, so you need to think on your feet sometimes and make stuff up on the fly, but the gonzo-tone of the adventure makes you feel comfortable doing it: it’s too wacky for you to worry much about breaking anything. For example, after obtaining the Null Rod – the MacGuffin artifact and anti-chaos mega-weapon –  the party visited the mouth of the Oracle of the Bottomless Pit. Teaming up with Dr. Thorontius (humanoid bear cosmology professor from the future) the team decided to destroy the Null Rod to prevent his rival and nemesis from using it to alter the space time continuum to create a robot apocalypse in the future. They asked the Oracle if tossing the Null Rod in his mouth (a bottomless pit) would destroy it. 

 . . . that’s not an answer the module provides!

I decided that since the center of the earth is a source of raw Chaos the Null Rod would eventually nullify all the Chaos there, ultimately upsetting the balance between Law and Chaos that sustains our reality and slowly but surely destroying the world. He then gave a hint to a Chaos Battery (found in Odious Uplands, the sequel to Operation Unfathomable and our next adventure!) that could reverse the polarity of the Null Rod and render it vulnerable to physical destruction. 

Well, you decide for yourself if that was a good ruling or not. My players bought it and I found a link to our next module. If you could handle that level of ad-lib then this module will be easy for you.

# PARTY OUTCOME

There aren’t many reviews of Operation Unfathomable online, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. My players entered the underworld with 3 level one PCs: Fartwolf the Fighter, Wooly Nelson the Wooly Neanderthal (a class unique to this module), and Eggy Weiner the Thief. In the first session, Eggy experimented with science fungoid spores and turned into a humanoid mushroom man. We used the stats of the Mycelian from Carcass Crawler #3. However, he got captured in a failed raid on the throne room of Shaggath-Ka, the local Chaos Godling, and the player rolled up a new character: Dorox Thundershield the Blue Dwarf who soon got a fungal brain infection and had his intelligence reduced significantly. Don’t eat strange mushrooms, kids!!

In the second session the party discovered and defeated Shaggath-Ka the Worm Sultan with the help of Antipersonnel Puffballs, a motley crew of suicide mission-sworn retired Paladins, and a host of weird magical abilities and mutations they had gained.  Big win and unexpected! Amazing what exploding neanderthal enemas can accomplish! His conniving worm-son, Shaggankh, was grateful to the party for expediting his father’s demise and his coronation as worm sultan and allowed them to leave with their lives as a reward.

In session three the party continued their search for the Null Rod or some evidence of the absent prince’s whereabouts. They explored deep into the map and discovered a lot of the lore and history of the underworld. They also met some interesting NPCs, had a bunch of battles and whittled away at their supply of retainers and magic items. 

In the fourth and final session the party found the corpse of the lost prince, retrieved the Null Rod from a micro-sized civilization of Nanuits living in a frozen cave and beat a fast retreat to the surface. Some very lucky rolls and their remaining Antipersonnel Puffballs made handy work of the small Imperial strikeforce awaiting their return at the surface and the Citizen Lich Sorcerer leading the brigade who had designs to take the party prisoner and steal the rod back for the Empire. 

The players are now free and clear in the untamed wilds of Upper Mastadonia and ready to begin exploring the hexcrawl sequel to Operation Unfathomable – The Odious Uplands! 

It’s worth noting that they are mostly almost at 3rd level now. There is not a lot of gold and riches to plunder in the underworld. I gave 500 bonus milestone XP when they killed the Chaos Godling and when they completed the module to compensate and celebrate those pretty cool achievements. That may be sacrilegious to some so know that there’s not a lot to support leveling up if you’re strictly XP for Gold style. 

I expected this adventure to take way longer than it did. However, I’m really happy with how it went and glad that the players made it through so much wacky content in our four, three-and-a-half hour sessions. Very successful!

# FINAL THOUGHTS

I’m so happy we played this. It’s goofy and fun and full of amazing memorable encounters. It’s a pretty beefy module with a lot of words and amazing artwork that you’ll be absolutely dying to share with your players when they encounter some new transdimensional monstrosity. It’s not as easy as some of the OSE-style dungeon modules to run but it’s worth the extra effort to read & roll ahead. We are all super-excited to continue with the setting in Jason Sholtis's follow-up setting/module Odious Uplands!

*NOTE: We used the DCC module “Frozen in Time” as a funnel before playing Operation Unfathomable and it was a pitch perfect match in terms of tropes and themes. Definitely recommended: it’s a really good module itself and the text-heavy DCC module experience kinda prepared me to run Operation Unfathomable right after.

16t7klx,Swords and Wizardry Complete Revised kicks ass.,"After running two sessions of S&WC:R (the latest version), I can safely say that out of all of the rulesets I've picked up since jumping into the TSR era of rules, this clone has absolutely blown me away.

I've run BECMI/RC, OSE, Whitebox FMAG, and \*WN, and I wish I had started with S&W from the jump.

My favorite bits, in no particular order:

* 20 levels, optionally going further (I tend to run years-long campaigns with a solid group)
* Race is not class
* Fighters beat ass, gaining an attack against any 1 HD creatures in range from level 1
* Monks beat ass
* AD&D player options, Basic D&D game loop
* Loose, fluid rules for easy rulings
* Bolt on OSRIC or Classic D&D rules to fill any gap, no conversion required.
* Players \*instantly\* gelled with it, after chafing against OSE and BECMI. (We all started with 3.5 for context)
* My existing OSR library functions as the supplemental material for this system.

The real killer though was that it's 40 bucks for the whole game in one hardcover book, and after the eyewatering costs for OSEs (great!) hardcovers, this was a pleasant surprise.

I know the ruleset has been around for a while, but as a newcomer to playing the grand daddy of the hobby (OD&D + Supplements), Swords and Wizardry has been a breath of fresh air over the race-as-class of B/XCMI, which for my players was inevitably going to feel stifling, even if they liked the simplicity and fast chargen.

If you haven't played it, or if you're new to the OSR, pick up a copy. If you have played it, surely you know what I'm blathering about.

10/10, definitely my personal RPG of the year, OSR or not.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c54e1e0>,osr,1695780196.0
1fgnggp,A little overview of brazilian focused OSR Discord Servers (After a month of use),"Hey everyone, I decided to update the list based on my experience after using each of these servers for a month. (I received some private feedback about some of these servers and decided to check them out more thoroughly.)

-> I notice that many people are looking for recommendations for Discord servers that talk about OSR RPGs in Brazil. So far, I haven't found a place that gathers all these invites in one place. So here they are. (updated with a one-month usage preview):

[https://discord.gg/YtnJa4zs2h](https://discord.gg/YtnJa4zs2h) OSR BR (This server, unfortunately, seems to have no activity whatsoever. It looks abandoned. People come and go, but there’s no posting.)

[https://discord.gg/g7w9WvewUC](https://discord.gg/g7w9WvewUC) Old is Cool (This server has “old” just in the name. In practice, it has no old-school activity whatsoever. There’s some overall trafic. Very rare, but it's there. It’s more about promoting modern style of playing RPG servers and related things than Oldschool, though. The moderators should try to improve it because there are a lot of people in there. Wasted potential.)

[https://discord.gg/9CXfsf2bqY](https://discord.gg/9CXfsf2bqY) LadoB (A very niche server. There’s a very small group that chats in there from time to time. They even organize some games, but it seems like the focus of the server  is posting videos from the owner’s YouTube channel, and occasionally there are clarifications on old-school rules. Better than nothing, I guess, but it could be much better.)

[https://discord.gg/Wx4vyFwRkC](https://discord.gg/Wx4vyFwRkC) JACA (A very small server, not many people. There are a lot of channels, though. People posts often, but not much, probably because of the few people in it. There are good posts about the scene, though. The server seems really focused on the Oldschool theme. The owner should reduce the number of inactive channels—it just makes everything seem abandoned. But it’s a server with potential, if activity picks up.)

[https://discord.gg/HFq44TnR39](https://discord.gg/HFq44TnR39) Brainstorm (Another server that seems focused only on organizing games. I found it quite strange. There’s zero movement, some announcements of other places here and there, and there isn’t even a general chat channel. Seems abandoned by the owner.)

[https://discord.gg/wkYGsjn](https://discord.gg/wkYGsjn) Oh Shit Run! (This one is quite active but seems more focused on actual OSR games play. There’s a game practically every day, which is good. But there isn’t much conversation among users around it. There are quite a few people, with some big posts occasionally, but it lacks traction. For a server solely focused on games, it seems to fulfill its role. It was the only one I found that has regular old-school games.)

[https://discord.gg/Cb7Fxqc](https://discord.gg/Cb7Fxqc) Dados Críticos (I noticed this server isn’t really focused on old-school gaming. It seems more like a general RPG hub, which aligns with the owner’s YouTube channel. It’s quite active, with people asking questions, answering them, promoting their own stuff, etc. It’s a shame it doesn’t focus more on OSR. But occasionally, there’s a comment here and there about it.)

[https://discord.gg/NUF5hrQSzq](https://discord.gg/NUF5hrQSzq) Geração Xerox (A very quiet server, with very few people. I noticed there are games in there as well, but not very often. It is focused on OSR, but it could be more active. There aren’t too many channels, which is good in my view. But some channels are locked up for no apparent reason.)

1hl4x8j,Adventure Review: Secret of the Black Crag,"Hi all! I had some extra time this holiday season and wanted to make a review of ""Secret of the Black Crag."" My group played the hell out of this module for almost a year so I thought it would be good to close the book on it by getting some thoughts down. I put it on [my tumbler place](https://shining-skull.tumblr.com/post/770714824162279424/adventure-review-secret-of-the-black-crag) and I'll put the text in here too. Hopefully it's of some use to anyone considering the module!

**AUTHOR/PUBLISHER:** *Chance Dudinack*  
**SYSTEM:** *Old School Essentials*  
**LEVEL RANGE:** *1-5*

# THE PITCH

*A strange and legendary mountain has emerged from the depths of the sea. Strange fish-people are attacking ships and waylaying travelers. The pirate shanty-town of Port Fortune is where your quest to uncover the secrets of the Black Crag begins.*

# CONTEXT

I backed this Kickstarter many moons ago when I saw that it was being written by Chance Dudinack. I played and loved his ‘Black Wyrm of Brandonsford” many times and knew that this would be a winner. 

We spent the better part of a year playing this in-person weekly or bi-weekly with one GM and two PCs. Lots of retainers died in the making of this review.

# PREP TIME

I read the book one time from front to back over the course of a couple of hours. It’s not that long.

I strongly recommend reading the section at the front of the book about the history and background of the Black Crag: once the party enters that final dungeon it will help the GM a lot to know what the goals of the different factions are. 

Understanding and/or deciding the relationships between Red Rathbone (mayor of Port Fortune), the Sea Hag, the Merfolk, and the Tatunca villagers ahead of time would benefit the GM in the long haul.

Awesomely, the book contains all the content needed to manage ocean travel so it was a great quick reference during play. I still needed the OSE rule book to look up some spells for my players but most of the adventure content is found in the book, including monster & ship stat blocks and magic item effects. 

There are plenty of random tables to roll on if you want to ‘prep as you play’. There are fantastic resources for creating fun and flavorful NPCs on the fly and some very useful pre-made pirate ships & crews that came in super handy. 

NPCs are unique and all have enough ‘personality’ to make them stand out against each other and be easy to roleplay for the GM without having to remember too much. Likewise, the relationships and goals of factions and NPCs are described well and simple enough to run without getting bogged down or needing to cross reference anything.

Take note: some of the labels on the downloadable content don’t match the numbers and letters in the book. This was my one gripe that made things clunky sometimes at the table. Absolutely not a deal-breaker though! Just a smudge on an otherwise fantastic experience.

Overall, this was very easy to run “seat of the pants” and I was super-impressed by the clear layout and ‘just enough’ descriptions. I never planned ahead for a single session and we had a fantastic time.

# AT THE TABLE

My party hadn’t played a pirate/nautical themed adventure so this was an eye-opener. After their first day at Port Fortune they attempted to sail the seas in a tiny dinghy. They got lost and a random table had them stuck on a sandbar after their boat was struck by lightning and capsized. The ocean became a ‘faction’ on its own at that point. 

At sunrise, a legendary Great White Shark began circling. The fighter managed to harpoon a makeshift raft to it and leap on its back and steer the beast to the closest island. 

The different islands provided loads of exciting themed experiences. There were giant birds, strange glowing space-eggs, cave monsters, monkey temples and all the fun stuff you’d hope for. Session-to-session the party would just decide what unexplored place to visit or stop by on the way to the place they were heading and they’d often find more than they’d bargained for. 

# OLD SCHOOL VIBES

Black Crag is packed with interesting factions and relationships. Much like Chance Dudinacks other adventure “The Black Worm of Brandonsford,” there are loads of relationships and connections between locations and NPCs built into the game that lead players to make interesting and world-impacting decisions. 

They developed interesting ad-hoc relationships with the different factions and were able to come up with their own interesting goals and designs. As the adventure progressed they promised vengeance against the captain of an imperial treasure barge, Lord Duke Baron, who had embarrassed them early in the adventure. One player, after being mutated during a magical pact to gain water breathing abilities, decided to woo the Queen of the Mermaids. Not surprisingly, the party started collecting ships and trying to make their own fleet.  It was pretty epic.

Exploration is a big part of the game. The map of the Salamander Islands was very useful. I printed out an 11x17 size copy of it for the players and they traced their travels and made notes on it using a red pen. It was a useful tool, fun prop, and a great keepsake of the adventure! It provided the chance for meaningful and engaging overland exploration in addition to dungeon delves.

Dungeons have lots of different paths through and there’s often more than one way to solve a problem or make it across a trap. Magical crystals can be found at different places across the map that can be used in multiple dungeon locations so sometimes it’s worth it to revisit a dungeon to use a crystal you’ve found to access a new area. Likewise, some areas in dungeons are flooded and require water-breathing to make meaningful progress through. Accessing potions of water-breathing and longer term solutions became a goal of it’s own in our campaign.

Encounters are definitely not balanced: the party got in hot water a few times and loads of retainers were slaughtered. We ran with lots of retainers from the pirate crews and the cost to convince them to join skyrocketed as word spread of how much of a death sentence it was to be a retainer for the party.

There’s an awesome classic flavor to this adventure with just enough creativity to make it fresh. Giant statue guardians, enormous fauna, volcanoes, strange progenitor races, and the like all make for a super-fun old school vibe. Black Crag doesn’t ever reach ‘gonzo’ levels of weirdness but there’s just enough strange in there to keep things interesting, mysterious, and fun. 

# TREASURE AND LOOT

The best treasure was always finding another ship to add to the fleet. 

The loot varied from low-key player-creative stuff like a voice-recording mechanical parrot, to utility items like a conch shell that creates air bubbles for underwater exploration, to magical swords and tridents. There are scads of pirate loot to collect and my players went from Level 1 to Level 5 pretty easily by looting hordes and treasure ships full of gold bars, coins, and other trade goods like casks of whiskey, etc.

The most impactful treasure was a water producing sea-dragon’s pearl that was used to flood a barricaded temple and commit monkey genocide to prevent the rise of an intelligent simian empire.

All that said, the loot may be the weakest part of the module. Nothing made the players stand up and shout. I added in some homebrew items that made use of the gems that I knew the players would enjoy to compensate.

# MONSTERS AND FACTIONS

There are lots of unique monsters to this module. Standouts for our adventure were a giant, two-headed roc, the named megalodon shark, intelligent monkeys, precursor beings, and the sea dragon. 

# TRAPS AND PUZZLES

Most of the puzzles and traps rely on player’s accessing magical gems to proceed. This can make things a bit simple sometimes but it’s also good because players rarely got stumped by puzzles they couldn’t solve. The traps had pretty simple solutions in most cases which I think is good. It gave players pause for thought without frustrating them entirely. I wouldn’t say that this module is characterized by complex or intriguing puzzles though.

# GM CHALLENGES

As a GM, I needed to get savvy with ship-based combat and ocean travel rules, which I had not used before. Thankfully, all the info I needed was in the Black Crag book so quick reference was easy. 

Managing crew-vs-crew combat was also something new for me. I wound up buying some cubes of Chessex mini-d6’s and houseruling group combat basically using the rules from RISK. It worked and was still fun!

Some of the events that could occur were game-changing and led to end-game scenarios that exceeded the scope of the book to describe and run. The final session required a bit of prep on my part to prepare. The map significantly changed and technologies that were not present before came into play. However, we ran this campaign for the better part of a year and the only prep I needed to do was for the finale, so I think that’s fair.

Once more, some of the map labels didn’t match the book which made at-the-table reference a pain sometimes. However, the book is pretty slim and I was still able to cope. Not a deal-breaker. 

# PARTY OUTCOME

Our party ultimately succeeded in solving the mystery of the Black Crag and becoming the most notorious pirates in the Salamander Archipelago. Two main characters became wedded to local royalty, one was unrecognizable after being blinded, mutated, and losing his true name in ill-fated bargains with a sea witch. 

We ended with a bit of a cliffhanger as one of the possible ‘big bads’ in the adventure became empowered through the PC’s actions. We may revisit it as a one-shot to have a final battle! 

# FINAL THOUGHTS

This campaign is one of the best I’ve ever run as a self-contained module. We got almost a year of weekly or bi-weekly gaming out of it and I pretty much never had to prep anything, so that’s a massive win. If you are looking for a pirate-themed campaign this rings the bell. The scope is big enough for exploration and fun but contained enough to be manageable and have interesting domino effects occur. 

Players really got into watching their characters mutate and evolve, designed their own ‘jolly roger’ flags and named their ships, and grew their influence and renown as pirates. The campaign never got dull and always felt fun and exciting.

12rvg3h,Dungeon Crawls in Cinema,"This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/11fzwur/dungeon_crawl_movie_ose_anthology_series/) from February has some user suggestions for films with dungeon crawls in them.

[I evaluate each movie](https://directsungames.blogspot.com/2023/04/dungeon-crawls-in-cinema.html) based on a set of ~~rigorous, objective~~ criteria that I personally believe are essential to a successful dungeon crawl: tension, the  unknown, craftiness, hopelessness, and overall dungeon crawl vibes.

1h9zpd4,"Mothership Review, OSR with Newbies, and Running and re-writing a module on the fly","Last week, I ran Mothership TTRPG for the first time, for a group of friends who have never played Mothership, have little (no?) experience with OSR-style gaming, and many of us had not played a ttrpg together. New rules, new people, new play style. You’d think this would be a recipe for a bad time, but we had a blast. Mothership sells itself as a spooky, deadly sci-fi horror game and it delivered.

This isn’t a a review per se, but a mish-mash of reflection-review-pondering. I want to document some of the pro’s and cons of my experience as a Warden, as well as some commentary on the game, OSR, and module. 

**Prep:** 

In preparing to run the game, I read through the Player’s Guide, Warden’s Manual, and the full Another Bug Hunt module. I decided early on that I was going to challenge myself with running a module (which I have only done a few times in my gaming career, preferring to create my own worlds and stories instead). On this first read through, a few things stood out to me as worth noting. 

First, the main mechanism for pressure in the game is the Stress mechanic. Whenever a roll goes poorly, stress increases. Eventually, this should lead to difficulties succeeding at rolls, and eventually Panic checks. This sets up the rhythm of increasing tension throughout a session, where there is a spiral down toward the eventual demise or bare survival of the party. This is where the Fun(TM) lives in the game. 

Second, the Warden’s Manual does a great job teaching how to set up the peaks and valleys of a good horror game, creating tension, relieving tension. The Warden’s manual is the advice book I wanted to exist when prepping horror for Stars Without Number, Darkhope, and the several sessions I’ve run of Dread.  I’m really excited to use it deliberately in future games.

Third, at first glance, the one-shot scenario in Another Bug Hunt reads as an Aliens 2 rewrite.  It was surprising how much our play session ended up as a different experience entirely. 

Additionally, as I was prepping for the game, I wanted to test myself to improvise on the fly and not need to do heavy prepping. I made no notes, but tried to visualize areas in the module, understand where the pressure and relief would come from, and think through how to create that feeling at the table. Whether that succeeded or not is up to my players, but I didn’t feel particularly unprepared at any time during the session.

**What went well:** 

**Digital dice and character creation:**

Mothership has a character creation app, that allows a character to be created in literally 5 minutes or less. Select a class, click some buttons for stats and saves, and decide if you want a random loadout or not. 

And then, throughout the whole session, your character is on your phone. Need to roll a combat check at advantage? Click click, then a the result. And it automatically adds stress on a failure.  I never noticed how much time at the table could be spent on asking what dice to roll and interpreting. Using the app was seemless. 

**Rhythm:**

Setting the horror tone and creating pressure: I had already decided that the game would operate in 3 Acts. Act 1 was discovery, some exploration and the first sign of real threats. Act 2 was about the first encountered with the aliens, and Act3 was the death spiral and the rush to escape. This worked super well! Tension mounted and was released throughout the night, and it was really fun to watch how the players interacted and played with the game pieces. In the “didn’t go well” section, I talk about how some elements of the tension *weren’t* relieved and why this made for a bad writing and threw off some of the rhythm. 

**Player engagement:**

The horror element, the setting, knowing that your characters were disposable and designed to be either. The players screamed, complained, laughted. It was wonderful. 

**Knocking the rust off:**

This was the first RPG I’ve run in about 3 years. I’ve played some GMless games, and a played as a character a few times, but it’s been awhile since I actually ran a game. Given that, things went great! 

**What didn’t go well:**

**Transitioning from module description to improvised description:**

You know how boring it to listen to someone just read their PowerPoint slides? The same thing happens with reading out of a module. The descriptions are good but sparse. Because I’m not used to running modules, there were several times when I simply read out of the module the descriptions, and did not further embellish. From my view, this is wrong and novice work. My job as a GM-Warden, is to create in my player’s mind an idea of what they are encountering and seeing and merely reading out of the module just isn’t sufficient. I will do better next time! This was my biggest personal critique of the night and seems like an easy enough fix.

**OSR style play:**

As a mild qualifier to the above point, it is also a characteristic of OSR-style play for the players to ask for more information, ask questions, literally describe what their characters do. It’s common for players who have been steeped in modern DnD to struggle with this. In modern DnD, your character sheet describes what you can do and what you’re good at. In OSR games, there are no skills or feats or class abilities to support you; your character sheet is sparse. Player skill is paramount and one of the critical skills is asking questions. 

We ran into a few snags in this and frankly, I did a mixed job of encouraging this style of play, definitely resorting back to a modern DnD style of GMing around combat encounters.

Despite this being a bit clunky, this was the most fun element of the game to me, forcing my players to simply describe what they wanted to do. The number of bids that were essentially “Perception” check requests because the players were scared to go into a room was amazing and it felt fun as a horror GM to say, “you’ll have to get closer and actually touch it to find out.” 

**Fear becomes paralyzing:**

Our session was a long one. I intended it to push along for about 3 hours or so, but we ended up playing for close to 5. Additionally, the module has “bad stuff” happen basically every time players do things, which I believe unintentionally teaches the players to stop interacting. In a way, this is kind of cool: a group of marines land on an alien world and slowly the morale breaks until they are feeling hopeless. But in practice, we had several stalling moments toward the end of the evening, where the players were both tired and it seemed like every pathway was bad or risky. 

I believe this is a feature of the game and not a bug, but that doesn’t make it good! Eventually, they pushed through and one of the players just said “Fuck it. I’m gonna go fight the damn thing,” and that spilled us into the final stages of Act 3. This has me wondering how I can create pressure and forward momentum so that those moments of paralysis don’t pile up. What a fun story-telling puzzle! 

**Another Bug Hunt Module:**

I touched on this in the above point, but it’s bad design to make most of the routes to success unexpected traps and problems. The module is riddled with “this seems like a good idea but surprise, it’s not.” The booby trapped armored vehicle in the same room as the first real encounter with the Carc marine is one such example.

Additionally, I find the Carc’s monster design boring. They are basically just biological chainsaws with no special abilities and thick skins. The reason that the xenomorphs of the Alien franchise work is because they have multiple stages (huggers, xenomorphs, queen), multiple objectives (defend, hunt, implant), can’t be attacked without the consequence of acid blood and they don’t always kill you. The carc’s are written to just attack and hurt you. 

I modified them on the fly to have their armor break, so they went from impossible to hurt, to suddenly harm able. (Though I wish I had telegraphed this better!) I also made them have a close range use of the Shriek, which could infect the players. Thinking of this further, I would have made them either slow and tankier or fast and fragile (maybe they can adapt and some skin color change indicates if they are in slow mode or fast mode?), and given them an obvious weakness to light or something like that. I wanted there to be some mechanism for the players to funnel the monster or to flee. More choices and less “Fight or flee.”  

**Playing in my GMing weakness:**

I am really good at characters, creating my own scenarios, social encounters and complex and fun combat encounters. This game was a sci-fi dungeon crawl written by someone else, with virtually no NPC’s, no real social encounters, with a highly simplified monster combat. Add on that this was a new game to me and the players, and I’m basically picking up one of the more challenging GMing tasks I could. I had so much fun getting the reps in on these skills, but it definitely felt like GMing with one hand behind my back. 

**Conclusion:**

Overall, I’m very pleased with the game. Most of the clunkiness we experienced can be attributed to a new system and using someone else’s created module, and most of the success can be contributed to clever and fun players, good tension and release cycles, and solid mechanical support from the Stress system. 

I’d love to run another few Mothership sessions, perhaps using other materials from Tuesday Games, or running my own game. I’d especially love to follow the advice of the Warden’s Guide, and build out a horror scenario using their structure.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c5993a0>,osr,1733712037.0

1cwxql1,Thoughts on Deathbringer?,"I'm a big fan of Professor DM from Dungeon Craft, so of course I bought his game/hack/supplement Deathbringer. 

I have to admit... I'm a bit ambivalent about it.

For one thing, it feels a bit lazy/undercooked. It's only a few pages, but there is at least one typo in it. It's supposed to be able to be transposed onto 5e, but I doubt much playtesting with that was actually done. It changes so much that I'm not really sure how you could use both products. 

The Deathbringer Dice are a very solid idea though. I think having flexible dice that can be used however you want is a great idea, though I do think one/level isn't really enough. 

Finally, the classes feel a bit... lackluster. Insufficient. The clerics/witchhunters/whatever are just worse fighters with one spell (if I remember correctly).

The spellcasting table is cool, though. 

As a big fan of his, I hate to be so negative about his baby, but it just seems insufficient.

1b45cke,You're Sleeping On Swyvers - A Short Review,"(Originally a blog found [*here*](https://talesfromthelamp.substack.com/p/review-swyvers-bloody-good-writing))

I'm not a massive fan of most TTRPG reviews. I don't think they can always capture the essence of a system, how individual players would engage with it in a specific session, under the specific conditions it is run in, and with any given individual's specific GMing ""style"".

I am, however, a massive fan of [**Swyvers**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/melsonia/swyvers). I also think you, yes *you* dear reader, should give it a go. I did, and my players have been loving it since; I'll share some banger play reports one day I promise!

So, instead of trying to articulate what I find so great about the rules themselves, I'd like to focus on another aspect - just how brilliantly the rules are written...

Here is a sampling of my favourite phrases.

*""If literate, explain how:""*
*""Fish hook: up a fish, or under a nail.""*
*""Nasty tip — put a bottle in a sack, smash it up with a hammer. Throw powdered glass at people chasing you.""*
*""Mint Lawyer: like other lawyers but not shit.""*
*""Useless in a fight. Nobles love them, everyone else despises them. Tiny useless rat-dog.""*
*""Investments - Church. Dunno if donation is gonna be enough to sort us out, but might be worth a punt?""*
*""Sexual fluids become alcoholic. After two months of this, -3 con per day.""*
*""Carousing - You’ve got a ring on your finger and a spouse by your side. Shit.""*
*""No secret – as honest as they come (in this business).""*
*""Prudence Garland, bride-in-hiding.""*
***(All from the Swyvers preview 4 PDF)***

Too often when writing rules systems writers don't focus on writing. How you articulate the rules, and present an implied setting, is just as important as what rules you do create. Put some **voice** into your rule-books, even if it's just subtle!

As a result of Gearing's use of this voice, the Swyvers bestiary is a treat. Not just because there are some unique, beautifully grungy, creatures contained within - but because each foe and danger has a nickname or codeword given by locals. You really get the sense that hushed tales of *""Blinking Larrys""* and *""the Green Grocers""* swirl over whatever piss-ale they serve in the flea-bitten inns of The Smoke; and it builds up these creatures to a semi-legendary status.

So yeah, I really recommend [**Swyvers**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/melsonia/swyvers). [**The Kickstarter**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/melsonia/swyvers) has less than a week left (***!!!***) and I'm sad it hasn't raked in more cash; but I guess that's just the nature of TTRPGs right now. The world very much needs more games like Swyvers, designed as passion projects by people who love creating games foremost, and it is sobering to watch sharted out film tie-in games and soul-less 5e modules get more attention and money.

Heck, you can even (at time of writing) get the Swyvers rules for **$1** on [DriveThru](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/467572/swyvers-quickstart) and for **FREE** on [Itch](https://melsonian-arts-council.itch.io/swyvers) - but [Melsonia](https://www.melsonia.com/) know how to make nice physical books (Every Troika edition is a real gem) so you should go with dead-tree if you can afford it!

But yes, please [**back it**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/melsonia/swyvers) if this interested you - I think it's really good.
Thank you for reading.

Sincerly,
A 'Umble Cheesethief

12f3iev,So . . . I bought all the Old-School Essentials books/adventures . . .,"I left 5th edition as fast as my feet could carry me lol and originally meant to return to 1st edition but then this place turned me on to OSE and I bought everything lol classic and advanced books because I wanted to compare the two systems.

I am a little torn between the two systems to be honest. Until the start of 2022 I had always remained classic 1st edition. It's basically all I knew my entire D&D life ever since Basic/Expert and 1st ed was the only thing to play so I was 1st edition grown since day 1.

**OSE Classic:** I love the level 14 cap. That is one of the high points of the system. My one worry, well not really a worry but it did raise questions with me. Technically it only had 7 classes, 8 if you include that Dwarf Cleric from GAZ6 *""The Dwarves of Rockhome""*. My thinking is with only 7/8 actually classes to choose from, my players could possibly get a little bored with the small selection of classes to play. I'm not saying that will happen, but I was discussing this with my oldest friend and player of 40+ years and he mentioned this as well. Me and him personally wouldn't have a problem with the small class selection but my other players might. So yea it's just something we discussed. OSE Classic overall has a very B/X feel to it which I 100% approve of.

**OSE Advanced:** Advanced also has the classic feel to it, not as much as Classic but to an extent it feels like classic but I am getting a lot of 1st edition D&D vibes from it which is a slight turn off since I was raised on 1st edition for 35-40'ish years . . . which makes me feel like *""damn do I want to play something new that has 1st edition written all over it""* I'm not saying it's a bas system, it just gives me that 1st edition feel and the entire reason for me coming to OSE was to go full blown classic.

So let me ask you folks that play OSE Classic/Advanced . . . Which version do you prefer and why? Do you prefer OSE Classic because it's more like B/X or do you prefer OSE Advance because of the 1st edition vibes it has?

1dkk9a8,RONIN SAGA Looks Amazing!,"u/True_Kobayashi released this lustrous new gem into the world and I have to say, WOW.

In short: it's everything good about Black Sword Hack: Ultimate Chaos with some modern fixes that make it even better.

My group and I got our hands on Black Sword Hack: Ultimate Chaos Edition last summer. I listened to the great interview on the Dieku Podcast and learned what a cool person Kobayashi is. We played it for months and ran a campaign set in Luke Gearing's ""Wolves Upon the Coast"" setting. It was so fun. That combination of lean and mean, fast to play, tons of cool things that can happen - we loved it. The natural end point approached - I think the party was up to 5th and 6th level (we used quicker levelling). We did notice the system started to creak a little as the power level got higher what with how 'roll under' works when you get high stats, but that was  a quibble. 

Imagine my delight on finding RONIN SAGA a day ago. I loved BSH. I love cool Japanese stuff. I am playing Ghost of Tsushima *right now* on PC. How was I NOT going to love this? Answer: I didn't have a chance. 

This is honestly a FANTASTIC game. Here I am trying so hard to not spend money on my favourite hobby but the products coming out are so good. How can I resist? 

Why is it good? The art, direct clear writing, open ended (but scaffolded) structure are an immediately BOOM. Sandbox, but with direction (You are exploring islands and rescuing/reclaiming them for the Empire). 

The rules are everything good about BSH but with a lot of small gripes simply fixed. The three stats (Brawn, Wits, Agility) and three skills (Bow, Blade, Sorcery) are added to a D20 (sometimes advantage/disadvantage plays a part) and then you beat a DC. Players roll to hit and to defend as in BSH. This seems even more streamlined than BSH and less prone to breakage as power level climbs. 

There's also a super cool Duel mechanic which I'm dying to use. I feel like I'm in Sword of Doom already! (When the sword point dips... someone is gonna die)

There are fantastic, flavourful monsters provided that give enough hints that you can design anything by extrapolating. I can tell right away I can run with this. 

And finally, beyond all the great materials, charts, random tables, etc that give you practically everything you need for a long campaign there is the core structure of the game. You go to and island that used to be part of the Empire and explore them and rescue/save the island and people. What this means is you can drop in everything you ever wanted to do. Expedition to the Barrier Peaks? That could be on an island. Hall of the Blood King? That could be on an island. OA2: Night of the Seven Swords? That could be on an Island. Did you always dream of converting Moebius: The Orb of Celestial Harmony to an rpg adventure? Here is the place. That's 5 more islands right there!

I can't recommend this high enough. We truly live in a diamond age.

1dt8qh3,"DDA3: ""The Eye of Traldar"" (1991) Review","# Intro

Some months ago, my friends and I watched several videos by [Mr. Welch](https://www.youtube.com/@Mr_Welch) talking about the old-school D&D setting Mystara. His passion for the game and its setting clearly showed though and it sounded incredibly interesting. So, I volunteered to run a game for my tabletop group.

I decided I wouldn’t do a conversion or anything, so I actually ran the game in BECMI using the RulesCyclopedia. 

I didn’t have much experience DMing though, so I asked for suggestions for good modules for first time DMs and got some pretty good tips (seriously, thank you so much for your suggestions everyone!). Following [this suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/19dxo6l/comment/kjd5oyk/) by the amazing u/Gigoachef, I decided to start with the module *The Eye of Traldar*.

My group just finished last week, so I thought I would give a review of my experiences with the module as well as my thoughts on the system in general.

# Summary

The adventure started with my players’ characters – a fighter, a magic-user, and elf, and a cleric – sitting around a campfire off the side of the main road. Suddenly a man rushes past on horseback, and his horse is shot out from under him. He falls into the camp and the group is now attacked by unknown assailants. The magic-user is able to dispatch half of them with a sleep spell while the elf and fighter pick off the others with their bow and sword, respectively.

After the battle the man introduces himself as Alexei. He was tracking down a magical artifact called the Eye of Traldar which can be used to control minds and was stolen by the evil Baron Ludwig von Hendriks of the comically named Fort Doom.

As they did not trust anyone operating from a place called “Fort Doom” to have an artifact that could control minds, the players all immediately volunteered to help Alexei recover the Eye.

The party heads to the nearby town of Luln where they get in ambush and the fighter dies. Next session, that player rolls up a dwarf and an NPC tells the party that the Baron is currently away and they’re keeping the eye in a mage’s tower inside the fort’s ~~keep~~ gatehouse. They are given some disguises and a Staff of Healing (which also happened to have five charges of Cure Disease on it) and then they head to the city of Fort Doom.

They meet another NPC in the city who tells them that the best way into the fortress is though some monster-filled caves which the Baron throws prisoners into. The caves themselves are a pretty standard. The players went through them room by room, killing various ghouls, skeletons, and even a carrion crawler. The real danger in this cave though? The giant rats.

Knowing that each time a rat hits you, you have a 5% chance of catching a disease which will kill you in 1d6 days, my players ran from the giant rats whenever they came across them and went out of their way to avoid the obvious rat room.

After killing the cave boss – a bugbear, his dog, and his three zombies – the players went up into the fort’s dungeons.

Like, the literal dungeons; the prisons below the fort.

Here’s where the adventure started getting interesting. The actual dungeon level was mostly non-linear, with multiple paths through it, giving the players lots of options in how to explore. First, the players questioned the prisoners for information and promised to free them on their way out.

They also found a torturer and his victim. They killed the torturer in a fight and then the edgelord player mercy killed the dying victim before he could use his last words to reveal where he had hidden his treasure.

Oh well!

They found and orc chained in a cell and decided to kill it. The magic-user then threw molotov cocktails at it until it burned to death. Of course, had they fed it and set it free, it would have joined them as an ally.

Oh well!

Eventually they found the guard barracks. A fight ensures and they get overwhelmed. In order to salvage the situation, the elf uses Charm Person on the head guard and they have the last remaining guard thrown in prison. They then get some information and head up into the ~~keep~~ gatehouse where they use some stolen uniforms to bluff the guards into letting them through without a fight.

This is where the main part of the adventure starts. The ~~keep~~ gatehouse contains large courtyard surrounded by high walls. In the middle is a three story mage’s tower. The players need to sneak around the courtyard either by night or in disguise. Going from building to building fighting or bluffing their way past enemies, grabbing treasure, and looking for the pass they need to get into the tower. It’s very non-linear and gives the plays a lot of latitude in how they want to approach it.

Or they could do what my one of my players did and skip all that by annoying the doorman of the tower until he actually called out his boss (a necromancer cleric) and he and his six skeletons come out and starts a fight.

Also, they split the party.

Do to a series of ridiculously lucky rolls they managed to not die (seriously, if I had not rolled so poorly, those skeletons would butchered the dwarf and cleric). And after turning the skeletons, the magic-user then put the cleric and some of the snipers on the battlements to sleep with a well aimed sleep spell allowing the party to easily dispatch them.

They then proceeded to enter the tower. Inside they found an alchemist (A low-level magic-user) and pressed him for information. After figuring that he was forced to work for the Baron and didn’t know anything, they let him go.

They continued up the tower until they got to the top floor where they had to fight all of its inhabitants at once; a magic-user, a thief, and that doorman. After charming the thief and killing the other two, they learn that they kicked up enough of a commotion that the Eye had been moved to the main gates and was being prepared to be sent to the Baron. They were also able to loot an elven cloak (enemies can’t detect the wearer unless they roll a 1 on a d6).

The players, now in panic mode, rushed out of the tower where they came across two skeletons standing over the body of the alchemist. Because, as it turns out, turning undead doesn’t make them go away forever!

After killing the skeletons, they ran to the gates leading into the fortress proper. They knew they couldn’t open them, so they decided to split the party, each group going into the buildings on either side of the gates to find the mechanism to open them. (They didn’t need to do this. They just needed to knock and they could have bluffed their way in!)

The elf and magic-user went to the left, opening the door and coming across a latrine filled with giant rats. The elf’s eyes watered as the smell hit her like a punch to the face. She closed the door without going in and they decided to join back with the other group.

The dwarf and cleric went to the right, breaking down the door to the room and immediately going murderhobo on the guard captain and his assistant. As the elf and magic-user came to help, the magic-user decided to (for reasons I cannot comprehend) pelt the door of the latrine with molotov cocktails.

This caused the noxious methane gas within to ignite and explode. This is the sort of thing the magic-user’s player does a lot (like he has ended several past campaigns for our other DM due to his character doing arson or blowing things up).

This immediately drew the attention of all the guards in the fort’s main gate. The magic-user immediately retreated into the guard station with the dwarf and cleric while the elf donned the elven cloak and tried to kill the enemy magic-user from behind.

The fighter, cleric, and the NPC Alexei (he’s still with the party; he’s a 3^(rd) level fighter) formed a choke point at the door of the building while the magic-user tossed molotov cocktails into the enemy lines. While he did kill a lot of enemies this way, he also flubbed one of his rolls and hit the cleric, burning him to death.

Oh well!

Just as the elf was getting overwhelmed I had the two characters she had charmed ride in and help dispatch some of the enemies that were surrounding her.

After dispatching the enemies, the players, knowing reinforcements were on their way, grabbed the Eye of Traldar off the enemy magic-user and the Staff of Healing off of the cleric’s burning corpse and made their escape.

The way they were *supposed* to do this according to the module was to steal some horses from the stable and bluff their way through the front gate. But, since the players did the mage’s tower first, they never found the stables.

So, they headed back through the dungeons, letting all the prisoners free (netting them a nice 50 xp per group), and going back out through the caves. Also the dead cleric’s player rolled up a thief and joined up with the party when they let him out of his cell.

Cleverly, they set a formation before entering the caves, with the dwarf and Alexei in the front, the prisoners and charmed NPCs taking up the center, and the thief, elf, and magic-user in the back.

This was smart, because I totally had the rats they didn’t kill on their first time through ambush them on their way out. That’s right! You thought you could get away with not killing all the enemies on a dungeon level!? Not on my watch! Muahahaha!

The rats seemed especially agitated and were covered in soot, as though something above their den had exploded somehow.

Anyway the players made it though without catching any disease from the rats and that basically ended the adventure. They rode off to Luln to report into the NPC there and then rode to the capital of Specularum to go on further adventures.

# My thoughts the adventure

Overall, *The Eye of Traldar* was a great experience. Fort Doom had some top-tier dungeon design. I can see why this module would be recommended for new players. It starts off simply before ramping up in complexity, letting the players and DM get used to the mechanics over time. The assault on the ~~keep~~ gatehouse itself is especially good in how open it is and how many ways there are to go about exploring it. The encounters were also set up in clever ways, requiring the players to think tactically about how to approach them.

The module also has tips for new DMs. Those were okay, but not perfect. A lot of them had to do with what to do if new players weren’t really getting into the “spirit” of D&D. But that was not really a problem with my players, who are pretty experienced at tabletop. On the other hand, a lot of areas that could have used some tips didn’t have much to offer. The dungeons are pretty open, with a lot of room for players to go off the rails. So some tips on what to do if the players took certain actions (like not finding the stables, for example) might have been nice.

There were a few small print mistakes in the book I had. For example, the titular Eye of Traldar first was listed as being stolen from the Lake of Lost Souls but later listed as being stolen from the Lake of Lost Dreams (Lake of Lost Dreams is the canon name. It’s the one that shows up on the official maps of Mystara). Also, Alexei promises 25 gold to the players for escorting him to Luln, but a different NPC is listed as giving them 50 when they arrive.

Also, the writers do not know what a “keep” is.

According to [medievalbritain.com](https://medievalbritain.com/type/medieval-life/architecture/parts-of-a-medieval-castle-the-keep/), a castle’s keep is “the strongest portion of a medieval fortification and the last resort in case of a siege or attack. It was usually a fortified tower built within the walls”. In the text, the module repeatedly describes the area the Eye of Traldar in as a “keep”, but it is absolutely not a keep. It has a gate leading into the fortress proper, as well as one leading into the town. This makes it a [gatehouse](https://www.exploring-castles.com/castle_designs/gatehouse/), not a keep.

It just bothered me, is all. It took me like, an hour of reading the module, looking at the maps, and researching medieval castles to figure out where this was supposed to take place.

But aside from that, excellent adventure. 10/10. No notes.

# Changes

While the adventure was really fun and well designed, I did make a few changes to it. Mostly just minor things for convenience or pacing.

The main change I made was to convert all the AC values from THAC0 to a more modern AC system using this [invaluable guide](https://caressofsteel.github.io/demos/dndrulescyclopedia/) from the amazing CaressofSteel. Seriously, the work they did in clarifying and correcting ambiguous or incorrect rules from the RulesCyclopedia was amazing. Thank you so much dude.

I changed some of Alexei’s introduction as well. In the module, he’s being chased by Iron Ring slavers when he runs into the player’s camp, forcing them to fight off *his* enemies just to defend themselves. It made him come off as a bit of an asshole. So, I made him fall into the camp by accident, that way it felt less like he was intentionally dragging the players into his problems.

I also cut out a lot of the exposition from the start. Alexei spends three long paragraphs describing his backstory to the players. It all came off as very convoluted, and didn’t actually have much to do with the plot of the module, so I cut most of it out. In the town of Luln, the players also had to visit multiple shops and talk to several NPCs who mostly felt extraneous to the adventure, so I combined most of those into a single encounter with a single NPC to simplify it and move them faster to the main adventure.

Near the beginning of the adventure, the players get a Staff of Healing. I added a few charges of Cure Disease to the it since a party of level one players will have no other way to treat disease, I thought that was my best option.

Finally, I implemented some variant rules from the August 1980 edition of Dragon Magazine for burning oil (molotov cocktails). Basically, on a failed roll, I roll a d8 and the bottle hits a random square around its intended target. This did end up killing the cleric, but it does kinda balance what is one of the strongest weapons at low levels.

# Thoughts on BECMI D&D

Overall, I found BECMI to be a really fun system to run. I’m more used to playing Pathfinder, so there were definitely some oddities, but it still runs really well. It’s especially interesting seeing the different assumptions in how the writers approached game design and balance.

It’s neat that the different races count as classes and that each class levels differently and has different level caps. That’s a unique way of balancing things.

One especially cool mechanic is that you can “microdose” certain potions. For example you can drink a potion of invisibility making you invisible for an hour, of you can divide it into six “sips” giving you ten minutes of invisibility per sip.

Combat is quick and satisfyingly deadly. None of my players’ characters had more than six health and most enemies could do a d6 of damage. So even a single mistake could be deadly, which forced the players to think carefully about when and how to engage in combat. So they often relied on bluffing their way out of combat or using underhanded tactics to avoid danger.

It was also interesting that initiative was rolled each round for the whole party, rather than individually, which gave the game a bit of a tactical, Fire Emblem-esque feel.

Skill checks are also done in a really unique way in this edition. Rather than getting a bonus based on your skill, you try and roll under that skill. So, if the party is trying to do an Int check, they roll a d20. The magic-user with an Int of 17 has to roll a 17 or less, while the fighter with an Int of 11 has a much lower margin of error. Since stats cap at 18, it actually makes a lot of logical sense when rolling a d20 to try and roll low, since there’s always a chance of failure, but each stat point feels like it really matters.

On the other hand, it does get a little confusing how the rolls aren’t consistent. For skills you want to roll low, for attacks you want to roll high. To search for secret doors you want a 1 on a d6, to open doors you want a 5 or a 6.

It’s pretty rules-light overall, so there’s a lot of room to improvise and interpret things. Which is cool! But some things just aren’t explained that well or left up to interpretation when more explanation would be better. Turning undead is a prime example of this, where there is a huge amount of discretion for the DM on how turned undead are supposed to behave and how long they actually stay turned. I also kind of wish The RulesCyclopedia was more well arranged. It’s often hard to find the information you need.

Another thing is that magic-users are a bit of a pain at level one. They only have one spell and no cantrips. So, once they cast their one spell, they’re basically dead weight. I do get that that’s part of the game balance; magic-users are supposed to be super weak at low levels, but if they survive they become terrifyingly strong. But, in practice, it makes them pretty boring to play at level 1 since they can’t meaningfully contribute except maybe once per dungeon level. That’s why about halfway through the adventure, I let my magic-user buy burning oil and a sling (which were allowed under an optional rule set), so they could do something even when they had used their spell for the day.

On the other hand, even certain first level spells could be terrifyingly powerful. Sleep is always cited as a particularly OP spell that can trivialize most low-level encounters. But, Charm Person is probably my favorite though, since it can have a potentially *infinite* duration. The spell has no fixed duration, but depending on the victims Int, they get a saving throw anywhere from every few hours to every few *weeks*. For a first level spell. It’s pretty amusing, honestly.

Overall though, I really enjoyed DMing *The Eye of Traldar* and running it in BECMI. My players are pretty interested in continuing, so we’re probably going keep playing for the foreseeable future. Next we might do a few minor adventures and then I’m hoping to do *Dark Knight’s Terror*. I’ve heard it’s a pretty good followup to *The Eye of Traldar*.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c671490>,osr,1719880435.0

10ysg5d,The God That Crawls (actual play review),"\[contains affiliate links and some self-promo. previously posted [here](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2023/02/the-god-that-crawls-actual-play-review.html)\]

[The God That Crawls](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/105954/The-God-that-Crawls?affiliate_id=403100)\*, is a LotFP adventure by James Raggi (if you don't know LoTFP, [read this](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2023/01/a-glance-at-basic-d-bx-and-some-clones.html)). Here is the blurb:

>A murdering cult.A religious order dedicated to protecting sacred history.An ancient catacomb full of danger and reward.The God that CrawlsA  dungeon chase adventure for characters of levels 1–2 for use with  Lamentations of the Flame Princess Weird Fantasy Role-Playing and other  traditional role-playing games.

**Why did I buy/read this?** I find many LotFP adventures interesting, including [Better Than Any Man](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/116452/Better-Than-Any-Man?affiliate_id=403100), which you can get for free. So I've gathered some for my [current sandbox](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2022/10/sandbox-quest.html), including this one.

**Review**:Like  many LotFP adventures, this has awesome ideas, mixed with strange  stuff. It seems like they always intended to do something novel instead  of the tired ""goblins and skeletons in adjacent rooms"" that you can find  in many D&D adventures, and I commend them for that. On  the other hand, this taste for novelty sometimes makes the adventures  become ""anti-adventures"" - instead of something that is easy to use,  they become partially exciting, partially unusable.For example: instead of providing hooks, this book says:

>The hook or motivation to get the player characters to the church is up to the Referee, who would know how to get the players involved better than any adventure writer. No hooks that cast suspicion on the priest or villagers before the adventure begins should be used, as the natural paranoia of adventurer swill be in effect anyway.\[...\]Father Bacon is the leader of both the church, the community around it \[...\] He will be very adamant about not allowing visitors beyond the altar of the church. \[...\]   
>  
>It is perfectly possible (even likely with some groups) that player characters will not fall for any of the tricks and will not be trapped in the dungeon, especially ifthe Referee seems a little too eager to get them down there. No matter. If they just walk away, they are leaving a lot of treasure behind. If they do something rash like slaughter the priest and/or a bunchof villagers and walk away, they will havethe legitimate authorities after them soon and that will be adventure enough. Force nothing; this adventure provide san environment and a handy guide forresolving “What happens if…?” within that environment. This adventure is nota club with which to bludgeon players.

So,  you need a strong motive to invade a church, that the book doesn't  provide. On the other hand, if you do invade it, the book advises you  that the PCs should be drugged or captured by troops and tossed into the  dungeon. And if the PCs don't want to explore... eh, what can you do?  Maybe choose another adventure.

\[In practice, Raggi was partially  right - the usual PC paranoia made sure that one PC insisted enough on  exploring the catacombs that they convinced the priest. Had I followed  the instructions to the letter, maybe the PC would have to choose  violence against the priest or simply leaving.\]

There is basically  one monster and LOTS of treasure. It is an interesting setup, and GREAT  for a change of pace. The monster is basically too strong for the PCs,  and the fact that there is only one main, unique antagonist makes it  feel ""special"".

**The goal of this module** is forcing the  players to think about encumbrance, movement, and mapping. The life of  the PCs depend on it. And there is more treasure and artifacts than the  PCs can carry, making these choices really meaningful. If you play this  module handwaving movement and encumbrance, you're missing half of the  point.

However, there are so much gold and magic items (and most  of them in a single location) that it makes them feel less special.  Also, most are cursed or dangerous, to the point of saturation.Books?  Some will kill will with no save, others will curse you, and one will  eventually destroy the universe. Scrolls will cause genocide across  Europe if sold to the highest bidder. or give you +1 attack bonus for  killing your parents. Magic weapon? Cursed. Statues? Cursed. Jewel?  Feeds on blood or maybe sucks you into the void if you try to take it. A  pile of excrement? Well, now *that* might be useful!

There are also ordinary potions and scrolls, and many items that the PCs will probably not be able to understand, carry or use.

In  short, unless you have an easy way of identifying magic items (e.g.,  ""make a spell saving throw"", etc.), you'll need another session after  the PCs have escaped to even start making sense of what they got. Or, if  the PCs are creative and want to test the items on the spot, they'll  probably pay dearly for it (and become discouraged *fast*).And then there is stuff like this:

>If at any point a character takes exactly 8points of damage (at once or cumulative,not 7 or less, not 9 or more, but at somepoint has taken exactly 8 points) while on the chariot, from any source, he dissipates into a whirlwind of sorrow and pain. Any player who laughs at this naturally withoutprompting can dictate the results of any one die throw in the future (do not reveal thisuntil the chariot stops). If it is the player whose character has disintegrated thatlaughs, he gets to determine the results of any two die throws in the future (includingduring new character creation).Any players caught laughing insincerely because they have read the adventure and wish to get the bonus must paint their nose yellow for the rest of the game session. If no yellow substance suitable for this purpose is available, one of that player’s character ability scores, selected at random, will be reduced to 3 until such time as the player completes an entire session with a yellow painted nose. Note this is a player-facing effect and new characters suffer this fate until the player complies.

I get that this is supposed to be humor... but it happens often, in random places, throughout the adventure.

**Anyway, the actual dungeon is really good.** It  gives you a labyrinthine feeling right away, with all its passages, ups  and downs, etc. Aside for a few situations where you just can't win  (best not to engage at all), most objects are interesting and provide  clues for the challenges ahead. The map is  decent (and good-looking) but I've found it hard to navigate due to the  (baffling) use of roman numerals and shades of blue and green that look  very similar on the screen (also, it is printed in black and white in  other parts of the book). There are enough stairs that will make you  flip back and forth constantly. Finding the way out took me a while. I  misunderstood one door to be barred from the wrong side, but that's  probably on me. 

In short: spend some time studying the maps before running this module.

**If you want to tone things down**,  you can change some of this stuff or allow some saving throws, or roll  to identify items... Alternatively, I think it would be fair to start  with a hook that allows the players that they are going into a place  full of stuff that might be better left buried, and that they must be  incredibly careful when interacting with it.

The art in this product (by Jason Rainville) is awesome and flavorful.

The  writing is good (if verbose), the backstory is great, and overall I'd  recommend checking this out if you want to play something different than  the usual stuff. I enjoyed running it and may even leave the players an  opportunity to go back (they escaped with lots of treasure, so I'm not  sure of what they're doing next).

**OVERVIEW** ([explanation here](http://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2021/02/so-reviews-and-mini-reviews-actual.html)):

**Usable**? Yes, with a bit of GM work it becomes a great adventure.

**Inspiring**? Definitely! Turns the idea of ""monsters in the dungeon"" on its head, it has great flavor and novelty.

**Bloated**?  A bit. You could cut the page count by half if you wanted something  more straightforward -although I'm sure there are people that enjoy the  absurdist humor, the crazy ideas, etc..

**Tiresome**? No, except, again, for the ""paint your nose yellow"" ideas.

**Clear**? Yes, except maybe for the map.

**In short**:  Awesome for a change of pace, requires some modification if you aren't  interested in giving PCs of levels 1-2 the opportunity to become  insanely rich, obtain legendary artifacts and potentially cause genocide  and world destruction... or if you don't want to tell the players to  put their character sheets in an envelope and leave in a public place  yadda yadda. Way more interesting than most ""vanilla"" adventures.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c7b1340>,osr,1676036929.0

15c8k36,Just got my print copy of Basic Fantasy 4e - First thoughts,"This book comes in at 201 pages, a 25% increase from the 164 pages of the previous edition. It's not much, but it is enough to be noticeable.

This doesn't seem to come at the sacrifice of light rules. Mechanically, it's identical at first glance. Of the 37 new pages, 25 of them are in the Monsters section, which looks like the biggest area of change. A lot, maybe most of the new space in this edition is for new art, and that's especially true here. There's also some new monsters, like the barklings, a small, caninoid race, rival to kobolds. The new art is pretty hit-or-miss. Some, like the barkling and the kobold, are great, while other (unmentioned) pieces are much lower quality. IPersonally, I'm a little disappointed that there's now art for the triceratops and for the sabre-toothed cat. Not because they're bad pictures (they're not), but just simply because I doodled in my own images for them in the old edition. Actually, I think the new pictures look even better than mine, so there's that.

The monsters are reorganized, too, and I love what was done here. Dragons have been renamed based on their environment rather than color, while still keeping a reference to their traditional colors. Similarly, all of the classic slime-like monsters have been renamed and categorized as jellies. The traditional names for the various jellies still have entries, with reference markers pointing to the jelly category. *This is functional.* 

There is one significant issue with my copy of this book, though. I seem to have gotten a misprint. For some reason, this doesn't include the credits page, table of contents, or the page of artists' credits. I don't know what went wrong or where; it could be every copy, or it could just be my copy. It's kind of a glaring problem, though.

Overall, I like what I see. It's still Basic Fantasy, it's still old school, it's still good, and it's still cheap. If you're coming from the previous edition, it's still everything you know and love, just with a nice new paint job and a better license. If you're new to Basic Fantasy, it's still an easy entry for the game.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c7b2fc0>,osr,1690576840.0

We all understood the lore and mechanical aspect of it but we all sort of just agreed that we didn't initially enjoy that ruling so we're looking for a way to replace it with something else. I have an idea of adding a code like, ""Rangers can't kill wild beasts mindlessly and if they kill a beast then they must harvest their parts"" something along the line of that.

Sort of saw that as another way to balance it out, sacrificing equipment sloths for their code. But if this can be revised or if you guys have any other ideas I'd love to hear them.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c7b3230>,osr,1708195892.0

11zkgy2,Doom of the Savage Kings (DCC ﻿#66﻿.5) - Actual play review,"[Originally posted here](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2023/03/doom-of-savage-kings-dcc-665-actual.html). Contains affiliate links and self-promo.

\---

[Doom of the Savage Kings (DCC #66.5)](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/129075/Dungeon-Crawl-Classics-665-Doom-of-the-Savage-King?affiliate_id=403100) is DCC adventure by Harley Stroh (if you don't know DCC, [read this](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2023/01/a-glance-at-basic-d-bx-and-some-clones.html)). Here is the blurb:

>**A Level 1 Adventure**High  above the windswept moors and darksome woods, the village of Hirot is  under siege. Each night, as the sun sinks beneath the western mountains  and the candles burn low, a devil-beast stalks the village streets,  unleashing its savage fury on the living. From warlord to pauper, crone  to child, no one is safe.Defeating  the immortal hound will require more than mere blades or even spells.  To slay the beast, the characters must delve into the mysteries of the  land and its Savage Kings. Only then, armed with relics forged from a  bloody past, can the most cunning and courageous of adventurers  challenge the hound of Hirot!

**Why did I buy/read this?** I find many DCC adventures interesting. So I've gathered some for my [current sandbox](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2022/10/sandbox-quest.html), including this one. I ran it using my [Dark Fantasy Basic](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/229046/Dark-Fantasy-Basic--Players-Guide), which required some mild adaptation.

This  DCC module is somewhat of a classic; I've heard people say good things  about it before, but I hadn't tried it. So I just inserted the village  of Hirot into my sandbox, a few rumors, and the PCs eventually went  there to investigate. 

My players are currently  in the third level. There were three of them, with three first level  hirelings. I changed some stats, but not much. So, while I felt that the  adventure looks hard for 3-4 1st level PCs, I cannot say for sure. This  is not meant as criticism, however; the adventure is fair, and players  with some experience will you avoid some of the worse traps in their way  (and, if they decide to take on a dozen enemies at once, they'll get  their fair ""reward""...).

This is a typical DCC  adventure: cool ideas, good maps, good art, some weirdness and humor. In  fact, it feels a bit less weird than some DCC adventures I ran before:  there's a village, and obvious threat, a small dungeon (in a  barrow-mound), a magic weapon, a witch...  It has a ""classic"" feel,   like a scene straight out of [Three Hearts and Three Lions](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2022/11/three-hearts-and-three-lions.html). 

Still,  the bits of weirdness are all interesting, creative and coherent: the  snake-ghouls, the demonic hound, the cursed swamp, and so on. This is  about the right balance between creativity and familiarity for me. 

As  for the adventure structure, it is the ""focused sandbox"" that is common  in modern adventures: the goal is more or less clear, but there are  multiple ways to get there (one of them being obviously more likely).  There are decent amounts of exploration, social interaction, and combat.  There are great creatures, NPCs and traps. There are enough places and  people in 20 pages to create multiple different situations, without ever  putting the PCs in a railroad. Likewise, the dungeon is not linear and  has multiple entrances.

(I must add that I  really like the format and contents of this dungeon - it is clever,  creative, coherent. I had some difficulties understanding the map for a  moment, but that might be just me).

Like most  DCC adventures, each monster and magic item is peculiar: there are no  goblins and skeletons in adjacent rooms, nor simple ""+1 spears"": things  always have a small distinction or two at the very least. Magic items  might be a bit too abundant for 1st-level adventurers, but this is a  dangerous adventure for them, so I think it's fair.

The  only baffling thing about the adventure is one particular scene that  takes less than one page: the PCs get ambushed for no apparent reason,  by NPCs they were, in theory, trying to help - and they also kill their  hirelings automatically, which feels like a cheap shot. A direct  confrontation in these circumstances felt harder than facing the hound  (in my game, the PCs managed to win due to being high level and a failed  morale check, but I don't know if this would be available with 1st  level PCs). It is unclear if there is room to negotiate avoiding  a  fight (the NPCs are willing to surrender), or if it would be possible to  still deal with the village after such a battle. In my games, the PCs  considered simply leaving after that, the village be damned, but  ultimately they decided to face the hound (I would have accepted any  decision, obviously).

I mention this not  because it detracts from the adventure - it doesn't - but only because I  think the DM should think about this specific scene before running the  module.

And, by the end, having a few loose threads might prove very useful for my sandbox...

Overall,  I found this to be an awesome adventure, above average even when  compared to other adventures I've picked because they were specifically  recommended.

**OVERVIEW** ([explanation here](http://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2021/02/so-reviews-and-mini-reviews-actual.html)):

**Usable**? Yes! This one is well organized and straightforward.

**Inspiring**? Yes! A bitt less weird than some DCC adventures.

**Bloated**? No. It has the right size.

**Tiresome**? Not at all.

**Clear**? Yes, mostly.

**In short**: As  you can see from the overview, this adventure succeeds in each of my  five criteria. This is probably a first here. DCC adventures are usually  good; this one has a bit more social interaction anb a bit less  weirdness than others. Because of that, it feels like a great adventure  to start a DCC campaign. Definitely **recommended**!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c8f88c0>,osr,1679578196.0

First of all, I presented it to my players and they love everything about the book. They said a lot about the feeling of the setting- one guy said he really liked the way all the equipment, food, and expenses are located right on the inside cover, another guy said the same about the basic rules on the back inside cover. OSR folks really do not waste any part of the buffalo book.
What people in my group agree is the best are how quickly character creation can go with the random generator online. They also came to a consensus that the frailty of their characters is an excellent change of pace, especially coming from 5e where you often become a demigod at some point between level 14 and 20. 
Our first randgen had -1 BDY, -3 DEX, -3 SVY, and -2 TEC. We call him Fiddle Porter, The Boy Who Sucked (like really sucked). And best of all no one was angry; it was just the cosmic hand the player was dealt.
We’re going to play a session when we have time. People in my group absolutely love the premise and the vibe… and the very weak characters who will be dying in space a lot.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c918680>,osr,1673096680.0

vkgklk,Heroes of Adventure Player's Handbook is Out!,"Heya folks, wanted to drop a link here for the OSR game that I've been in love with for a while. 

TLDR: [Heroes of Adventure](https://nameless-designer.itch.io/heroes-of-adventure) by The u/Nameless-Designer is a, feature rich game with roots in early editions of D&D but with new school systems that feel as if they should have always been there. And it's free!

So, I found this a while back by happenstance as I sailed the Reddit seas, and I fell in love with it immediately. Being free is a big plus for me (though in all honesty I can't wait until I can throw money at the project), and as I began skimming the original document I started getting a feeling of nostalgia and excitement that other OSR games at the time just couldn't match. I gushed about it a bit, and another version was shortly uploaded, and while I didn't notice all the changes (as the game was very tight to begin with) I decided to go ahead and print a copy for myself through Lulu. And then I started playing. First a bit of solo using additional solo systems that I enjoy, and then with my home group. Coming from Worlds Without Number (which they loved) for a short game in Heroes of Adventure they were pleasantly surprised with how natural it felt , despite being distinct enough to set apart. One of my players, not really as much into the gaming scene (and not aware of things like OSR even), said at one point ""Man this feels really old school.""

Enough gushing (for now), what is the game like. Well, the new Player's Handbook has again stoked my nostalgia, and those in the know will understand why. The Red stylized cover and back cover and the 64 page count contains all the rules needed to run the game (though the actual rules of play are only 4 of that). All that is missing is a full bestiary (though there is a sample monster in the Sample Game section which shows how easy statting a monster is), treasure tables (though there are plenty of equipment tables and crafting and alchemy rules so as not to be needed for a while, and veteran GMs could likely come up with their own anyway), and wilderness and dungeon design (which I know is coming in the GM's guide, which I'm wondering if it will be a blue cover). With this book you could easily run a game from an existing dungeon, though veteran GMs will likely be able to make their own content easily.

Also of note however is that the the full rules (Heroes of Adventure - Rules v0.2) are still up on the page as well, and contain all the additional content not included in the PHB.

What about the system? Well it's d20 based, but uses a step die system to represent everything else (being Traits, Skills, and Knowledge) so that you don't actually roll a base attribute line. Instead, your Strength is a die that is determined by your Race and Class (you may not begin with Strength at all actually) and your experience and growth as you play. I love this. It is simple, modular, and the system allows for great customization and growth. How are these Traits etc. used? Pretty much as you have already guessed. Any test is a d20 + the relevant Trait/Skill/Knowledge. The game uses Advantage and Disadvantage unsurprisingly, which rerolls the whole check and not just the d20, and critical success (nat 20 or 10 over) and failure (nat 1 or 10 under) are here. A tight, simple, familiar system.

Then comes character design and subsystems. Characters are one of 4 familiar but new races (well, save the bog standard human), Classes (8) are each broken down into 4 Careers that affect character creation and style. And each Race and Class is showcased on a single page (and thus easy to print and hand out to the player) which I love. There is also a simple but detailed background generation system to add character depth.

Crafting and Alchemy shine in this game, and I won't try to explain it but encourage you to pick up the (again free) pdf, as these sections might be worth the price of admission alone for any OSR gamer.

And Magic. Wow the magic. Several domains, each containing many spells, and the cool thing is that if you know a domain you can cast every spell on the list, just at disadvantage (possible spell failure has consequences). You only gain proficiency (no disadvantage to cast) with certain number of spells. And guess what, **anyone** can cast spells from a prepared scroll, or try at any rate. And miracles are handled differently (and in a really interesting, probably the most interesting I've seen) way.

All in all you really need to give this a read. It's a wonderful, tight and deep OSR game that really feels lived in. It's concisely written, clear, intuitive for a veteran and simple for a new player, and as I said, free!

And hopefully in the next week or so I'll have some One Page Dungeons designed to use with Heroes of Adventure. Keep an eye out.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c940680>,osr,1656168369.0

mqs6tm,The Stygian Library - New vs Old Comparison & Review,"[Video Flipthrough](https://youtu.be/0fEEd022tm4)

**Comparison and Review: New vs Old - The Stygian Library**

*by PM Schramm*

The remaster.  The ultimate chance to fix past mistakes and relaunch a product with modern sensibilities while incorporating the lessons learned into a finished deliverable, all while being paid to do it.  It sounds like a dream come true, as long as your initial product drew enough interest that funding a remaster is feasible. *The Stygian Library* definitely fits this criteria.  The self-proclaimed “dungeon for bibliophiles” by Emmy Allen has been lauded since its launch for the creativity and unique location it brings to a tabletop game.  The highly variable tables within promise a unique experience every time it’s delved.

But, with a remaster comes certain expectations.  Improvements.  Simply rereleasing the same product already available can burn through goodwill extremely quickly, and being accused of making a “money grab” is a real possibility.  Thankfully, *The Stygian Library* doesn’t fall into this category.  The remaster is definitely an improvement over the original; however, does it do enough?  Let’s begin by examining its predecessor.

## Look, Feel, and Space Utilization

The original release of this random dungeon generator was available from DriveThruRPG and, as is usual from their print-on-demand products, the softcover end result isn’t anything to write home about.  The paper is thin, the printing is blurry, the binding is glued, and the interior covers are not printed.  Overall, as a beat-around copy you’d use at the table - which this product is really designed for - it’s passable.  I would not be uncomfortable writing my own notes and fixing the grammatical errors I found in the margins of this booklet.  Speaking of grammatical errors, looking at the rear cover gives you an idea of what can be expected within *The Stygian Library*, both from a content, and writing style point of view:

> *“Sufficient Knowledge twists the world around it into strange shapes. This, then, is the Stygian Library…a creepily genteel dungeon set in an infinite extradimensional library. Each expedition generates its route as it explores, resulting in new locations being is covered* [sic] *with every visit…It’s a big spooky library full of dangerous knowledge, spiritual automata and ghost-fuelled computers. Designed for low to mid power levels, and suitable for use with most old-school systems with a little adaptation.”*

The book mostly delivers on the promises found on the rear.  It has a middling layout with well-placed pictures and no text creeping from one page to the next.

## Content

Opening the work we find a title page, followed by a copyright page.  Next is an extremely busy table of contents that is hard to parse.  The only benefit to this page is that the tables are italicized, finding anything else at a glance is impossible.  Even the titles and page numbers sometimes take up two lines.  Following this is an introduction page that gives some insight into what inspired the module and what systems it was designed for/using.  From there, we dive into the meat of the adventure.  This begins with the rules on running it.

Located on page 7, this section really would benefit from a play example and referenced page numbers because, as written, it’s a bit confusing.  Things that are referenced haven’t been revealed to the reader yet and an introductory section that gives you insight into the library (for example, the “Events” section located on page 8) would have set the stage much better.  Overall, this book’s layout is out of order, and the excuse listed in the intro to “read the whole book cover to cover a few times” is a bit of a cop-out.  Continuing on, the rules for running blindly aren’t explained clearly.  When running, the referee is supposed to roll a 1d4-1 to determine how much deeper the party ends up, exploding and stepping up die sizes if a max value roll is the result.  But, no reference to a result of 0 is given, and staying on the same level of the library isn’t a real option based on the other rules.  My suggestion to those running the module would be to simply re-roll 1s to avoid 0s, but the author’s intent is unclear.

Perhaps these specific rules are buried in the prose somewhere, but finding them can be a bit of a challenge as, while no text carries from one page to the next, this is sometimes to the layout’s detriment, as displayed on page 11 in a wall of writing.  Even in black and white, there would have been some options to help distinguish important information to discern at a glance, but this opportunity wasn’t taken through much of the adventure, including shading alternating table entries like could have been leveraged on pages 14 and 15.

## Usability

The usability issues for *The Stygian Library* continue through much of the booklet.  For example, one glaring issue is seen at the bottom of every page.  The graphics are blurry.  This could just be an issue with DriveThru’s printer; however, in addition to the blurriness the font choice for the page numbers is extremely small and hard to read.  In a book you’re going to be using at the table, the ease of flipping around to find tables and other entries is a crucial piece of the puzzle that was overlooked.  Granted, when flipping through, your brain has the tendency to fill in the gaps for numbers you can't actually read, but I’m fairly confident more than a few people will have an issue locating things with the page number graphics selected.

Another issue is shown next in the locations: the order they’re listed in appears to be the order they were written in, rather than in an alphabetical or logical order.  This makes it impossible to find something without looking it up first on page 13.  Better yet, the locations should be numbered, which would allow a clever referee to forgo looking up anything at all on the Locations table, as they could simply roll the die and find the result within the book if they so choose.

Rounding out the remainder of the booklet there are a few more grammatical and usability errors, for example the fact that throughout the text sometimes the page numbers for certain Librarians are listed, and sometimes they are not.  You may ask, “What are Librarians?”  The answer is they’re an important part to this dungeon as they make the whole thing work.  They’re listed at the rear of the module, in the bestiary section, far later than when it would have been preferred to learn about them.  It’s only one page, moving it to the beginning, near the intro, would have been a good design choice.

# The Remaster

There are more than a few areas that could have used improvement in the original *Stygian Library* - let’s look at the new release.  The first thing that’s immediately apparent is a drastic improvement in printing quality moving away from DriveThruRPG.  In addition, moving to an offset also grants the ability to leverage the interior covers for the printing of the tables used most often, a great advantage to a procedurally-generated dungeon!  Unfortunately, Allen opted not to use the interior covers for this purpose, but to instead display very basic artwork.  The reason why this decision was made is unclear.  The remaster has no additional functionality improvements in its form compared to its predecessor outside of a ribbon bookmark.  That’s a huge missed opportunity in this reviewer’s eyes.  At least the rear cover is now clear of grammatical errors.

Opening the adventure reveals a title page, a vastly improved table of contents, and then the introductory section. This is where the first differences in the interior text are noted. While the majority of the text and writing is the same, the references to *Lamentations of the Flame Princess* and *Swords & Wizardry* as particular systems used in the testing and writing of the module are now excluded, keeping instead the simple statement, “This was written & tested using a weird mishmash of OSR systems.” In addition, the mention of *A Red and Pleasant Land* by Zak S. was excluded from the section where the book’s inspiration is listed.

There are a few other changes here and there, some of which involves the addition of typos such as the space between “Somebody must have died there” and its period on page 9, but overall the format is much better and much less wall-of-textish.  Another example showing improvement is the cleanliness of the “How to Run” section on page 10.  The use of fonts and bolding is effective, something the previous iteration of this module did not leverage; that said, the time to revise the rules to provide clarity - specifically on the “Running Blindly” section previously noted - was disappointingly not taken.

This is the net result and my main gripe of the remaster.  Most of the writing and information is exactly the same with only a few slight tweaks and a better, but not great, layout.  For example, migrating the Librarians to the front wasn’t done because that’s how the original was laid out and the remaster doesn’t deviate a lot from its previous incarnation.  Even though the Librarians are so important and it makes much more sense to put them directly after the section they’re first mentioned in on page 18, they’re still near the end of the book on pages 112-115.  A remaster is supposed to be a reimagining of your previous work, a chance to fix and shore up the areas that needed improvement.  *The Stygian Library* didn’t take this opportunity.

All the included tables are the same compared to their previous versions, excluding the removal of the “don’t add depth” rule from the original encounter tables.  This is either something that was supposed to be added and simply wasn’t or was the only rules change included in the remaster.  This author’s guess is the former, especially considering the error for results >20 on the dreams and rumors tables on pages 132 and 142, but as-is it’s not necessarily a negative.  The change makes multiple re-rolls possible and boosts the average result higher.  The tables look much better, but once again the results don’t have their numbers listed on their respective pages.  At least they’re alphabetized this time, which makes it a bit easier to navigate, but *why aren’t these tables on the interior covers?*

More slight issues abound: the b on *B****one Beast*** on page 49 is missing its bolding and the events table on page 24 should have when to roll a d20 vs a d12 listed here, rather than on page 13 where it could be missed. The encounter tables on the subsequent pages include clarifications, there should be some here too.

## Conclusion

Overall, *The Stygian Library* remaster is, to put it simply, a missed opportunity.  The original needed more than just a fresh coat of paint.  It had some issues and errors that should have been addressed that weren’t, and the new format added issues that should have been caught in the editing stage.  Some of these errors are downright lazy, epitomized by the error on page 139. “I Search the Body” result #28: Book (Roll on the Types of Books Table [ppxx]).  Simply Ctrl+Fing for the obvious placeholder text [ppxx] during the layout stage or in the completed pdf before sending the book off to print would have caught this blunder, but no one thought to do it.

If you don’t own this adventure yet you want the remaster.  If you own the original is it worth it to buy the new one?  You make that call.  It certainly does look better sitting on your shelf.

zblunr,Planescape Box Set and Third Kingdom Games,"Recently, I bought the Lake of Abominations kickstarter and one of the things that came in with it was issue 0 of Populated Hexes Monthly and that led me to the Third Kingdom Games website to see if there were /more/ populated hexes monthly... and of course they were. 

Interestingly enough on the website there was also a section of used products which is how we found that Todd had a ton of used products for sale as well. 

I have to admit, we went on a bit of a spending spree (I purchased the populated hexes monthly which is a super high quality product in itself!) and then later we bought the Planescape AD&D box set (circa 1994). 

I didn't see a place to review on the website but I wanted to mention how good in shape this box set was. It was opened prior but it almost seems like it was brand new! There's no damage anywhere. I am super impressed with how good in shape the used products were. 

Honestly, it's such a great store for their own stuff and used OSR products. I purchased the boxset and the three monstrous compendium for Planescape. 

Truly nothing but positive things to say so I definitely recommend checking out the shop! https://www.thirdkingdomgames.com/used",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16c9ceb40>,osr,1670089415.0
