3,3,4wuhj4,"I figured out why I hated Suicide Squad so much; it was like watching a superhero themed RPG, played by all of the most annoying players ever.","Suicide Squad spoilers ahoy:

...

...

...

First of all, they all decided to play neutral/evil characters, despite the DM announcing a superhero themed game with a heroic plot. DM allows it for some reason, attempts to tweak the setup to allow it on the fly by making them beaten supervillains working for reduced prison sentences.

Deadshot is the one player actually attempting to take it seriously, even going so far as to give his character a back story. He tries his best, but he's not that good at improvising dialogue, so he winds up throwing out cheesy one liners that totally kill whatever atmosphere they've managed to cultivate. 

Flag is the buddy of the DM's that doesn't really play, but agreed to play the PC with the relationship with the BBEG to give the plot a hook, but only if he could play a ""normal"" guy as a character cause he thinks the rest of the group is a bunch of nerds.

Harley Quinn is the only girl at the table. Not actually there to play, just interested in getting attention from the male players by playing a really sexual character, but also acts like a total loon to keep them from getting any ideas that she's genuinely interested in them. 

Joker is the NPC the DM invented on the fly to try and keep Harley's player invested in the game. She doesn't care, and he winds up being a total mess of a character with all of the subtlety of a dump truck.

El Diablo is the guy who refuses to do anything to contribute to the success of the party in combat, because of reasons involving his character being tragic and edgy. When the others call him out, he shrugs and says, ""It's just what my character would do.""

Killer Croc is the guy browsing 4chan on his phone the whole time, looking up only to roll for an attack and say, ""Uh, yeah, I, uh...I'm a lizard guy. I eat people."" before going back to his phone.

Slipknot was the guy who tries to break the setting by going against the plot for no reason. DM kills him out of frustration, the player gets pissed and goes home. 

Captain Boomerang is actually a pretty decently built character, but his player gives him a pink unicorn fetish and an Australian accent to piss off the DM. Keeps bringing it up at weird times.

Katana is that weird guy who's SUPER into anime. Insists on playing a girl, and got all of his attributes from some weird Asian themed rulebook he ordered online from Europe that is actually for a different game. Again, DM allows it for some reason. Refuses to speak English during any roleplay.

The entire plot of the movie, from the Enchantress easily stealing the idol with her brother in it from Viola Davis, to the bland generic minions, to the evil sexy wiggling before the final battle, to every superhero movie cliché, is the DM trying out that homebrew game he wrote that he was super excited about, then realizing as it goes on that he is actually woefully unprepared and the party is not working with him, so he proceeds to phone it in and just get it to be over with so he can go write Version 2.

The soundtrack is the DM's iPod on shuffle in the background. Is actually the MVP of the game.

EDIT: So people are right, Harley and Katana should be switched, Katana is a girl super into anime, Harley is actually a guy playing a psycho chick. But I'm not changing it, so just imagine whichever is funnier, IDGAF.",rpg,1470719082.0,0,3335,613

7,13,71ztjs,RPGs and creepiness,"So, about a year ago, I made a post on r/dnd about how people should avoid being creepy in RPGs. By creepy I mean involving PCs in sexual or hyper-violent content without buy-in from the player. I was prompted to post this because someone had posted a ""worst RPG stories"" thread and there was a disturbing amount of posts by women (or men recounting the stories of their friends or girlfriends) about how their PC would be hit on or raped or assaulted in game. I found this really upsetting. 

What was more upsetting was the amount of apologetics for this kind of behavior in the thread. A lot of people asked why rape was intrinsically worse than murder. This of course was not the point. I personally cannot fathom involving sexual violence in a game I was running or playing in, but I'm not about to proscribe what other players do in their make believe universe. The point was about being socially aware enough to not assume other players are okay with sexual violence or hyper-violence, or at the very least to be seek out buy-in from fellow players. This was apparently some grotesque concession to the horrid, liberal forces of political correctness or something, because I got a shocking amount of push-back.

But I stand by it. Obviously it depends a lot on how well you know your group, but I can't imagine it ever hurting to have some mechanism of denoting what is on and off the table in terms of extreme content. Whether it be by discussing expectations before hand, or having some way of signaling that a line that is very salient to the player is being crossed as things unfold in-game. 

In the end, that post told me a lot about why some groups of people shy away from our hobby. The lack of awareness and compassion was dispiriting. But some people did seem to understand and support what I was saying.

Looking for bandages for the volunteer corps. Closed store, closed store, here's one that's opened (going to close in half an hour) - sorry, no bandages, all sold out.

Eureka! We've got the large medkit I've bought a couple years ago, with enough bandages for a bus full of passengers. Large medkit, now is your time to serve the Ukrainian people.

**Noon**. Okay, we have water, we have powerbanks, there are three shelters nearby. Let's grab some snacks.

Wow, there's bread at the supermarket!

**D&D**. Everyone looks at their phones. I DM and I don't mind, partially because I'm looking at my phone where a guy from Poland writes to me about the help that goes our way and also sends me jokes about Putin. I like that guy.

""Okay, let's roll on the encounter table... wow. A 20. Just as you finish breaking the statue, you notice a woman wearing a heavy grey cloak. She's heading your way. She's accompanied by two enormous wolves"".

""What do we know about werewolves? I've rolled a 6!""

""You know they're invulnerable to any normal weapon"".

""Have we got anything silver?""

""N-n-nope"".

""Hey guys, check this out! The roms have stolen another russian tank!""

""No way!""

""Hey, I can easily believe it"".

""So, those werewolves... fine, let's take a break"".

**Half an hour talking about war and how proud we are of the country and how the whole world suddenly decided to pay attention to what's happening. Then back to D&D.**

""I cast a spell on the wolves... are they immune to all magic?""

""Only to the spells that damage them"".

""Fine! I cast an illusion to make them see me as their mistress"".

Roll roll

""The first wolf sniffs your face. The second... make a roll... oh"".

""What? What?!""

""The second wolf sniffs your butt"".

The room quickly fills with suggestions about how to treat this situation, interrupted by another story about the stolen tank. Turns out the romani didn't steal it, they merely took it apart. Then they stole a heavy truck that was following the tank.

""I raise my axe, and strike at the woman when she turns her back!""

""Wow. A crit. Oh, wow. The axe of the One True King flashes as it strikes, and the witch falls with a shriek of pain"".

""The old psycho threatens the whole world with nuclear weapons now"".

""Eh, he's bluffing"".

""He's a cornered rat and he's a psychopath, he'll do anything"".

""That's what he wants everyone to believe"".

""Is the wolf that sniffs his butt male or female?""

**Afternoon**.

The battle ends, everyone survived (including the wolves), those who live in the other part of city have to leave now to get home before curfew.

""Thanks. Fun time. Same time next week?""

""Uh huh, next week we're gonna play Fallout - then we'll get inside and play D&D"".

""Ha! Good one"".

""So, next Sunday?""

""Yeah, things will be back to normal next Sunday"".

""Absolutely"".

14,29,ih97hd,Roleplaying is not voice acting.,"Hey everyone!

I have been a DM for D&D 5e for two years now. I'm generally someone who prefers roleplaying more than combat or exploration in my games. I often get into a situation where players tell me that they can't roleplay because they're not good at coming up with a good quip or an appropriately toned response to a fellow player or an NPC and I always assure them that's not what roleplaying means to me. In my tables, if a player wants to engage in a roleplaying scenario and behave in a certain way then they can just tell me what they're saying and how they're character is behaving while saying that and I'll treat it the same. 

This seems like a fairly common sense thing to do and props to you if you're a player or GM who does this. In my case it took me a while before I realized that this was a route I could take. I came from a theatre background and one of my earliest benchmarks for good roleplaying came from critical role so I was hooked in the acting and voice modulation they did. I only changed my ways when I came across a player who very earnestly thought they'd suck at the game if that's what roleplaying implied. Once I started running my games with more descriptive roleplaying, I've seen so much more active involvement from my players as a whole and never felt like I missed out on anything. In fact some of the best roleplaying experiences I've had as a DM was with that very same player who was not confident about their roleplaying ability.

This can also help your players feel more badass/skilled/smart depending on the scenario. Imagine getting your campaign to the point where your players have turned into champions commanding an army and one of them has to make a speech to rally the troops. If your player can come up with a speech that can rival Theoden (Lotr) on the spot then great! However, if your player can also describe a speech with the things they want to say and the effect they want it to have then that should be just as great! 

This also applies to the GM as well.  If you want to roleplay a menacing character who is deceptively charming and terrifying for your players then you shouldn't feel limited or let down by the stuff you can do with your voice or actions. You'll be able to achieve the same mental image by just using good descriptions.

Apologies if I'm late to the party and this is fairly common sense for everyone by now but I hope that it helped someone.",rpg,1598481672.0,0,2430,452

16,34,12uclyd,The weirdest thing to ever happen to me as a TTRPG designer.,"Here's a story of the strangest message I've ever gotten, and how it led to the most weird and wonderful thing I've ever done in the tabletop world. Two months ago, I got a short message on Twitter from an account I'd never interacted with. It read:

>Hello Kurt, we are an amusement museum located near Niagara Falls NY interested in having an event around your new TTRPG.

No further details other than a request for contact info.

So I'm intrigued, obviously. I love museums (the more niche the better). It wasn't a totally crazy message -- this was just before the release of [*Here We Used to Fly*](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/refling/here-we-used-to-fly), my game about abandoned theme parks and the bittersweet nostalgia of growing up. Part of me wondered if a curator had googled ""theme park game"" and found my weird TTRPG without knowing what it was. Which would be kind of a disaster because *Here We Used to Fly* is not only a weird imagination game, it's a weird, diceless, sometimes sad imagination game.

I showed my my dad and he thought it was a scam. But what kind of scam is so... specific? And even if it was the world's strangest scam, I had to know more.

I sent the museum an email with a pre-release copy of the game. I explained what it was and offered to help in any way that I reasonably could. I figured there was a decent chance that they would see what the game was and politely backpedal... but the message I got back was not what I expected at all.

They'd *already played the game*. Multiple staff members *backed the Kickstarter*. The museum is on the site of a real, historic carrousel factory. They have a WORKING 1916 CARROUSEL. The staff wanted people to **come roleplay amidst their exhibits**, and they made a big pitch to their board about how cool this would be. They asked me to come, too. (They're even paying me to be there, which is wild for a tiny museum.)

How could I say no to that?

And so, thanks to the passion of the Herschell Carrousel Museum staff, I get to both play pretend and ride century old ponies on May 20 near Buffalo New York. If you told me this was going to happen when I started designing games, I would not have believed you.

Feeling very grateful.

17,35,4rcdpz,How to play an elven character when you are not an elf: a guide,"-Interrupt people, especially non-elves. Your opinions are the most important in the room.

-Likewise, take care to explain things to non-elven party members even when they have vastly more skill ranks than you, as they will benefit from your years of experience  (in the parlance, this is known as “elfsplaining”).

-A good idea from a non-elf may be rewarded with a simple “But of course” or an “As I was about to say”.

-Sit cross-legged often.

-It is acceptable to exclude non-elves from a discussion or plan by having your discourse only in elven. Companions who wish to participate will spend the time required to learn the language. When they do this, it is your duty to correct their grammar.

-If you absolutely must use the common tongue, make your displeasure at doing so clear.

-Non-elves require eight hours of rest per night, rather than the usual four. Keep yourself occupied in the extra time with elven activities such as reading elven literature, writing poetry or crafting masterworked arrows.

-It is the responsibility of party members who lack lowlight vision to bring adequate light sources. If they are not prepared enough for a moonlit forest, they are not prepared enough to be adventuring with the likes of you.

-Non-elves often have poor hygiene, and some go for days on end unwashed in armor. When dealing with a smelly companion, it is best to use prestigitation to give them or their equipment a pleasant lavender scent. If you cannot cast cantrips, a decade or so in a reputable wizard college should confer this ability on you.

-The bow is the weapon of the true warrior. Except when it is the blade. Or magic. Always insist that your speciality is inherently superior to any other, and argue at length.

-Elves are naturally superior archers, wizards and warriors. This is because they were created before the younger races, when the world was more primal, and only the best archers, wizards and warriors would have survived, becoming the progenitors of the elven race. The young races, by comparison, thrive on mediocrity in the soft modern world. 

-Other people’s dietary choices are offensive. Make sure to remind them constantly.

-If a companion cannot seem to comprehend your words, it is best to use expressive sighs to communicate with them.",rpg,1467720900.0,0,2288,384

I thought it was an odd question, but as he left me alone to think about it, I realized I’d heard of wizards creating fire, summoning water, producing force, and all sorts other of objects and effects… but never of a Wizard just sitting in a tower summoning mounds of gold. You’d think if it was possible, *someone* would’ve done it by now right? Well…why haven’t they? 

It’s because gold *is* magic. Well, a physical manifestation and metaphysical conduit at the same time, but for your purposes, it *is* magic. I mean, when you sit and look at the evidence laid out, how could you not have come to the conclusion sooner? Let’s take, oh…dragons, for example. When you imagine a big bad dragon, the next thing you imagine is it guarding its’ hoard. Hoard of what you say? Oh, that’s right, GOLD. Doesn’t it strike you as a little odd that an entity whose literal being is infused with magic just happens to have not only an insatiable, but uncanny magnetism towards large quantities of gold, along with the urge to acquire as much as possible? Possibly Like-Begets-Like, mayhaps? 


What about Dwarves? This is a race whose history lies below ground, closest in proximity to the veins and shafts where gold accumulates and grows (Yes, I said grows). Also the only natural race with a strange resistance to magic. Interesting, wouldn’t you say? Almost as if there’s a subtle inoculation against it by such proximity for generations…

Lastly, to get back to what exactly I am doing with all this gold when I’m making your lovely magic item, or all my scrolls…You’re right that I’m not spending thousands of coins upon jewels and masterwork items to hold the magic in place. That’s ludicrous, but if eldritch manipulators are spending money on high end items to imbue, it’s probably a personal focusing preference. For myself though, as you can see, I am working with normal mundane items. As to the details, first I am transmogrifying via prestidigitation these elegant golden coins into their more metaphysically soluble powder form because essence diffusion is easier by an order of magnitude when working with particulates instead of a boatload of Big Ol’ Coins. Next, with a certain amount of forceful application of will and choice incantations, you will notice the gold powder I am sprinkling and kneading on top of the object appears to be being absorbed. Remember what I said about manifestation and conduit? So the gold is not only priming these boots to be receptive towards my spells, but it’s starting to establish a channel to arcane ley lines it order to keep the magic going. And yes, it is indeed very time consuming rubbing gold powder into an item one pinch at a time while maintaining the proper mental focus. There’s a REASON it takes us about eight hours for every thousand gold a magic item requires. You think a consortium of magic users got together and decided on union hours for magic making? Hell no. Its plain, old, tedious, but important work if you want it to function correctly.

Now, master-of-arms and all things armly, would you kindly let me focus on the task at hand so that when I’m done, we don’t have to worry about our Holy Dictator suffering from extreme vomiting and nausea whenever he puts his shoes on because I had to split my attention trying to condense decades of intense arcane study into an elementary discourse?""",rpg,1416826196.0,0,3621,627
19,37,k2il4g,"I ""meet"" a friend who died years ago through his old sheet","Hi guys. It happened a few hours ago and I wanted to talk about it. I've been playing RPG since 2009, when I was 8 years old. As I lived in a small town, the number of friends with whom I could share this interest was minimal and access to the material was almost impossible. We imagined characters with strengths and weaknesses and we had our adventures using just a few 6-sided dice and imagination, long before we got a Dragão Brazil (the biggest RPG magazine in our country) or something. At that time, the closest friend I had in this RPG little group was Saulo. Saulo was a nice guy and in the first Dragão Brasil we got, he fell in love with the Paladin class. Since then, G'Rainklir, the Goblin Paladin (he liked irony) has spread justice over Arton, armed with his club and shield.The players came and go, but the constant of having me as GM and Saulo as a Paladin never changed, even when he moved to the state capital. Even after we grew up, started in high school and all that, vacation was RPG time. All of this went very well until the end of 2015, Saulo was diagnosed with leukemia. It was a shit, a very, very, very terrible shit. He was the soul of the group, the guy who always had a joke on the tip of his tongue and was never discouraged by anything, in the game or in life. The doctors said they didn't have much to do, the disease had already advanced too much and that it would probably only help to alleviate his suffering. It was a really bad day. Whenever I, or someone of the gang could, we were at his house and every weekend of the vacation, after treatment, we played RPG and, in the meantime, he made all, ABSOLUTELY ALL the possible and imaginable jokes about death, cancer, whatever you imagine. He accepted it in a way that none of us accepted at the time and that it is still difficult to accept now. After a few months, the time we could play was decreasing, he needed to rest more and more, until in August 2016 he died while sleeping. Even today I remember not crying. It didn't seem real. It still doesn't seem like it, honestly, as if he would give me a call on the weekend and asking about Tormenta, D&D or Call of Cthulhu. The last thing he said to me was to put more bizarre monsters on the next adventure because his dice were itchy to use Smite Evil. I still laugh about it sometimes. Sometimes I still think about what kind of aberrant creature and demon I could toss on a guy who was going through hell every day. He wasn't even 17 when he died. Life went on, everyone learned to accept it, but I spent a long time without really dedicating myself to running a campaign, it didn't seem right. As if I owed my friend an adventure that I would never pay for. Today, for the first time in years, I went through my old RPG magazines and photocopies and found one thing: an old, battered character sheet, from a Level 18 Goblin Paladin called G'Rainklir. Maybe it was just a coincidence, maybe it's time to pay for that last adventure I owe. For now, I'm just smiling at the good times and crying for the same reason. I miss you buddy, I hope you are well

23,43,1c6ssoc,"My son saved my life with 40K and D&D, trying to figure out how to thank him","I honestly didn't know where to post this, but I needed to get it off my chest.

A few years ago during covid, my marriage and my life fell apart. It had always been rocky, but one day out of the blue I come home to find that my house had been completely trashed, my kids had moved out with their mom, and I was left alone. To make matters worse, I had lost my job and had a hard time finding another one due to the epidemic. I was actually, at 43 years old, making sandwiches at Publix. So here I am, no money, no kids, in a trashed house with even my pets gone. And I have some chronic health problems that due to not having insurance, were going untreated. I was falling apart mentally and physically.

I honestly considered suicide, but I could never do it because of my kids.

My son was into 40K and he said that he wanted to start playing on the weekend.  I managed to get an eBay credit card and lucked out finding a fully painted space marine force for 300 bucks. Every Saturday we would go to lunch and then to the game store to play. His new stepdad was pretty well off, so he was always playing different armies, but I played my space marines.

I was so poor that sometimes the rest of the week me and my new cat would share eggs for dinner. He never said anything, but he started paying for his own lunch. Then he would buy kits here and there for my favorite army, Orks. He would build them. He said it was so he could have someone to paint with.

Eventually I found a decent job and got mentally well enough to start putting my home together again (I won the home in the divorce, which is another story. I deserved it). I started my old D&D game back up. People would come and go, but he was there every other week. Never missed a game unless he was out of town.

Cut to now, I have a very good paying job, a wonderful girl that I plan to marry, and am happy, if a bit scarred. He still comes over to play and paint, and he makes sure I go to the gym with him four days a week as well.

We don't talk about feelings. We don't hug. I don't know how much of this was a plan to help me or just spend time with me, and how much of it was him wanting to play games. If I tried to thank him, I know he would freeze up and wouldn't be able to talk.

I want to thank him for saving my life but I don't know how. I have literally opened my mouth to say something a dozen times and couldn't get the words out.

  
(edit) I should add that my girlfriend is a huge part of this as well. Most of the rebuilding was due to her help. I just left her out because I don't have issues thanking her and telling her how I feel, but she is as awesome as he is.",rpg,1713408703.0,0,2654,538

25,46,af9cze,Have you ever walked out from a table without even starting the game?,"I just did for the first time. Due to age and drifting apart, my usual table can't barely get together, so I went to a local shop to ask if anyone would be interested in a game. I've been GM about 95% of my time in the hobby, and I told them I would be happy to direct a group.

So a group says they want to try pathfinder. We are making sheets, some have played d&d 3.5 way back, so they have a handle on things. I start discussing pathfinder 2e. My main complaint was skills. One goes:

""So what do you want skills for?""

I explain that skills are important for role-playing, finding solutions outside combat, etc.

One looks me dead in the eye and goes "" why do you want to avoid combat? This is d&d...""

And then they went on to describe combats they have had. By the way they were talking, they were very used to meta-gaming, power gaming and all in all generally be ""that guy"", not talking situations in game seriously.

So, what did I do? I let them finish the characters. I decide to give them a chance. Start already travelling. They meet a family travelling by caravan (the hook). The CLERIC, immediately, attacks the family. The others join. They kill half of it, except a kid and the mother.

""Ok, the boy is crying and the woman is holding his only surviving child, she is looking at you furiously, but knowing that they are both helpless. What do you do?""

The elf goes, ""do I know of any slavers?""

Half-orc barbarian (because of course he fucking was). ""Maybe de could keep the woman...""

26,48,516de8,I once spent two and a half months setting up a pun.,"I originally posted this to r/dmdadjokes, but I figured some of you might appreciate it.

This was part of my longest D&D campaign. It was pretty homebrewed 3.5, and we had the perfect mix of personalities. They also seemed to really appreciate all the work I put into writing for them.

The one thing they all *hated*, was the fact that it's nearly impossible for me to write without hiding puns in the content. It's compulsive. Even in my English classes, I would pepper in sentences that contained the most absurd puns.

It's a problem I've no intention of correcting.

So, in this game, the players have gotten to level 8 or 9, and they were exploring a new city. There were tons of things for the characters to do, NPCs to talk with, and thousands of little threads for them to pull on, but the one they went after most was this mysterious, humongous library.

Unbeknownst to the players, my DM notebook contained the helpful reminder ""something something mad god's library"" and the stupid punchline. That's it.

So, flying by the seat of my pants, I came up with this **crazy** layout. Eventually I sat down and wrote out a huge backstory for it, but it was still with the one gag in mind.

All the shelves were made of faded books, and all the readable books were in the wrong places. Any time they wanted to find something, it was inevitably in a different section: a famous NPC's history in the home and garden section, research on dragons in the fantasy section, poisonous alchemy in the cooking section, ect. This confused the shit out of them, and almost every second of down time they got was devoted to exploring this weird library.

There was a tall, creepy librarian (often the only other person in there) with a graying hair-bun and a hooked nose. She wore a black gown, and seemed to glide everywhere she went. She hardly spoke to them, but would point as a means to answer questions, and shush them if they got too loud. 

Eventually the players found a back room hidden behind a bookshelf. It had a ""Members Only"" sign on it, and when they asked the librarian about it, she quietly handed them a long form to fill out. (There was no trick here, but my players know better than to trust something that seems easy.)

Rather than get a library card, they resort to stealing books and replacing them after use. They soon noticed that if they left a book out of place, it would inevitably wind up in its randomly specific location. This weirded the rogue out most of all, and he convinced the fighter and the cleric that their best option was to break into the members only area in the middle of the day. Naturally, the rest of the party followed along. 

When they got to the other side they found this impossibly gigantic labyrinth of bookshelves. As they walked around, they noticed that the shelves were moving and changing on their own and they had no idea where to go. Well, two of them could fly (cleric and the fighter) and one was a teleporter (rogue,) so they scouted above while the others (witch and samurai) walked below

The rogue immediately noticed that the librarian was coming after them; shelves moved to make a path, and she seemed to glide straight to the people on the ground.

Well, never one to let a good idea come between him and an irrational impulse, the cleric took off in a dive straight for her, and  brandished his warhammer with a natural 20 toward intimidation. The terrified librarian shrieked and collapsed onto the ground, pulling books down on top of her and spasming in shock. 

Ever the honorable helper, the samurai leapt into action; pulling a syringe from his jacket. (Ok, so about that syringe... It fully heals and negates all status effects... But it also sends you into an uncontrollable rage) 
The samurai plunges the ""health potion"" straight into her heart, and fully injects the serum. 

The table went silent, apart from my laughter, and the fighter said ""I can not believe you just did that.""

Before they could really reflect on the choices made, the librarian let out a howling screech that knocked books off the shelves, and shook the floor. As the samurai backed up, he saw the librarian's torso crack and push outward. Still screaming, her face began to elongate, and her hands stretched into massive claws. Her back arched, and as the skin was stretched to its limit, wings shredded through where her shoulder blades had been.

At this point everyone was spending so much time arguing in character about what to do, no one did anything. The woman's face was shredded as a mouth in the shape of a humpback whale pushed out; it's baleen resembled the fanned pages of a paperback. As the monster grew, it started standing up on all fours. Huge cracks ran the length of the floor where it stepped. The librarian's skin was shredded like a bad sunburn to make room for leathery scales. Along its joints, and down its spine were golden bookbindings. It's huge wings fanned out to reveal feathered pages of arcane script, scrawled haphazardly.

The witch was the first to act. She ran up to the now 15 foot monster, and was backhanded into the bookshelf the rogue was standing on. In a single round, the monster had grown to over 30 feet tall, its weight started putting a huge strain on the ground. In the next round, the floor gave way and everyone who was not flying began to tumble into darkness.

Thinking quickly, the rogue reached out with his ability and saw that the floor was almost eight hundred feet down. He began teleporting the non-flyers to safety while the cleric and the fighter used their illuminated weapons to battle the slow-falling giant; it's enormous, leather bound claws, raking and clasping for them.

Dodging debris, and fighting a leathery whale-dragon, they eventually got within range of the witch, who proceeded to send torrents of flame up at the monster (and them.) The cleric used his warhammer to cripple its wings, and send it plummeting. When it landed, it roared up just as the fighter came down, rolling a perfect 20 and sailing bastard-sword-first into the creature's mouth, and out of its throat.

Pages began to burn away as the monster crumpled in a heap. Bleeding and weary, our adventurers found themselves in a massive underground cathedral. Deep, slow laughter came from the darkness all around them.

""So,"" said the god of madness, ""I see you've defeated my bookwyrm.""

Silence.

The rogue started laughing and shaking his head. The witch looked incredulous. The cleric put his head on the table. The samurai just smiled and tried to tell if I was serious. The fighter pushed his chair back and said ""I'm going to smoke. You are the fucking worst.""

As soon as they heard it, they knew that the past two months of their gaming lives had been an elaborate set up to the dumbest shit I could think of. I honestly would be hard pressed to find a moment where I made myself laugh harder. Just, the sheer amount of time and planning it took for that payoff was so worth it. I had tears streaming down my face as they left my house. The beautiful stupidity of it makes me smile to this day.

We took a week off and picked up from where we stopped. The game went on for another year and a half.

I am glad you like PbtA. I am. I love this community and I think it's great that PbtA has such enthusiastic fans. But I swear to Crom, it is a TERRIBLE idea to recommend a PbtA (or PbtA adjacent) game to someone just barely peeking their head out of the Cave of 5th Edition.

It's like if someone in Cleveland said, ""hey, I'm tired of the place I usually eat, do you know any other good restaurants?"" and you recommended something in PARIS. Yes, I'm sure it's very good, BUT IT'S TOO FAR FROM WHERE THEY ARE NOW TO BE A USEFUL SUGGESTION.

RuneQuest. Shadow of the Demon Lord/Weird Wizard. DCC. Pathfinder. There are plenty of games that are still crunchy high fantasy with fun combat systems that AREN'T 5th edition, things that will broaden a 5E player's horizons without making them bluescreen. I know a bunch of you are Apocalypse-pilled, but one of the things PbtA fans seem to love about it is that it is SO VERY DIFFERENT from ""traditional"" rpgs (which 5E clearly is). Maybe - JUST MAYBE - giving someone who only knows 5E a game that requires them to COMPLETELY REBUILD THEIR CONCEPTION OF HOW RPGs WORK is... I dunno, *a little much*.

With all the love in the world, I ask you to be gentle with them. They're trying. Steppin' out of their comfort zone. Please don't throw 'em into the deep end right off.

EDITED TO ADD:

For everyone who said that what's *really* important is to find out *why* someone wants to try stuff outside 5e and *what* they are looking for before deciding whether to suggest a PbtA game, I have two responses to make:

1. This is an *excellent* point, the kind of thing that really moves the conversation forward constructively, and I agree 101%.
2. In my entire time in this subreddit, I have never once seen a PbtA fan actually ask what someone is looking for in a game-rec before jumping in to suggest a PbtA game.

Hi all,

My friend and I trained an AI to draw Fantasy Avatars. You can use the images directly from the website or use a google colab notebook to generate thousands of images by yourself.

We always liked to have some artworks for our NPCs or our own characters. If nobody could draw well you end in searching the internet and don´t really have the feeling of individuality. With our AI you can generate tons of images and use them free anywhere.

The best:

* It is free
* there are no ads
* no login required

I would be very happy if you try it and tell me what you think about it.

Enjoy!

~~Hi all,~~

~~it seems, that my site offends some artists and I don´t want to ripp them off.~~

~~I think in many cases regarding AI the world is not ready yet.~~

~~My further plan is searching for artists, who want to cooperate in a project like this with me. To make a solid avatar generator without offending artists I need tons of drawings and illustrations of fantasy faces and your commitment to use them for training. If you are an artist reading this, feel free to contact me.~~

~~I personally didn´t want to make a huge amount of money (as you noticed there was no coffee button, no ads, nothing) I just wanted to give the PnP community nice avatars. Perhaps we can find a business model where you can generate profit or fame and I can build a fair avatar generator with YOUR pictures.~~

31,59,ghx7w9,"I was bullied at GenCon as a 13 yr old in 1978. Reminder to take care, especially of the young ones in the gaming world.","I thought I would share a story of when I was a kid, with hope other gamers can be reminded how important it is to take care of each other, and especially take care of the young kids at game stores and online and at conventions.

It was 1978 or so, and I was 12 or 13 years old. I was a complete D&D fanatic (5th level half-orc fighter) and played a ton of other rpg's as well like Traveller, Boot Hill, Top Secret, Chivalry and Sorcery, Tunnels and Trolls... and we also played a lot of Avalon Hill and SPI games, Steve Jackson games, Lou Zocchi, Judges Guild scenarios like Tegel Manor... I subscribed to The Dragon and Strategy & Tactics magazine. I was from a middle class family in Sarasota Florida, my dad was a writer, and when I found out about GenCon in Wisconsin I was so excited that such a place existed. I asked my parents if I could go - alone. And they said yes.

My parents were permissive and I had a lot of freedom as a kid, maybe too much, but they did realize this was a big, big deal for a 13 year old -- to fly across the country and stay in a hotel room for a role playing and wargame convention. But it was my idea, and they had encouraged me to stretch beyond my age a lot in my life - which was a good thing and has served me well. So they decided to support my love for games and the incredible opportunity to be at GenCon. Wow! Thanks Mom & Dad!

I took a plane, got the bus to my hotel room, and was at GenCon!!!

It was like an amazing all you can eat buffet of games. The games sessions list was enormous. There were miniatures and wargame dioramas everywhere, and dealer room was huge. I was scared around all these new people alone, but also excited. I had arrived at heaven! I remember the developers of a game called Ace of Aces - a picture book game - saw me walking around, and so they stopped me and played a round standing in front of their table, and I bought a copy of the 2 book set, still have it. And there were a ton of games to sign up for - so I signed up to play the Top Secret RPG - I loved 007 and secret agents and to play Top Secret was super exciting to me.

But the problem was I was really really shy. Scared. Talking with strangers was scary. Being there was scary. It was very hard for me to imagine playing a game with all these new people. Very hard. I wanted to stay in the dealer room and look at all the games and just read the rulebooks I had bought. It seemed like nobody was my age - this was a wargame convention, D&D was popular but there were no other kids my age I could see. I stood out, felt massively self conscious, like the small middle school kid at the cafeteria surrounded by larger seniors. (I don't know how conventions are now but I think back then it was a lot of college age and older?) I was really scared to not fit in with these other older people! But at the same time these were gamers and we all loved games right? So I gathered some courage and pushed myself and signed up, figuring if I got started and broke the ice and went to one game it would be easier to sign up for more.

I got to the room for the Top Secret session and there were about 11 players. All a lot older than me. The gamemaster (""administrator"" in Top Secret lingo) handed out pre-generated characters, and we started our mission to infiltrate a secret government facility. I was doing pretty well -- I was good at these games! -- and I found myself up on the roof, with the chance of a way into the facility that others hadn't spotted. I was playing an RPG I loved at GenCon!

At one point I had to get down from the roof to continue the mission. So I jumped down.

Now the gamemaster looked at me and said I had to take 1d6 of damage. Wait what? I said ""I need to take damage from jumping down?"" and he said Yes, annoyed that I had challenged him. I was flushed with humiliation and went silent. I rolled, I got a 4 or something. I had very low hit points to start. I was dead.

A wave of shame went over me, I had killed off my own character.

It was really disappointing and I felt bad. I looked around the room it was clear they didn't want me there, the only little kid among the adults. I gathered my things and left the room.

As I closed the door behind me I heard the room burst into laughter. I had felt bad when my character died, but now I plunged into searing emotional pain. I was extremely humiliated and in shock, feeling and hearing the entire room of players, who I wanted to like me and who I wanted to play games with, make fun of me behind my back. I started crying and went and hid somewhere away from everyone.

It took me a long time to figure it out, but I realized two things had happened.

First, I was the youngest person in the room, and so as a trick I had been given a pre-gen character that I realized was the weakest character in the scenario, with a weak strength and low hit points. Then I also realized that I had been tricked into dying -- I had said I ***jumped*** off the roof but the GM had made me roll damage as if I had ***fallen***\*,\* in order to try to kill me. The GM had set me up as a weak character unfairly, and then even more unfairly broken the rules of the game to kill me off by calling my jump a fall. When I questioned him on the rules I was right and he was wrong -- as anyone could plainly see. But nobody backed me up or spoke up for me and he went ahead and made me roll damage. And then the GM and the entire room had laughed at me when I died, as if who was I, a little kid, to be at their convention, the stupid little kid who killed himself off.

I didn't sign up for any other games running in the convention.

No one in that room knew how vulnerable I was to this bullying. Maybe if they had known more about me, it wouldn't have happened. But that's always how bullying is - the victim can be vulnerable and get hurt in ways the bullies don't bother to think about or care about. But seeing this kid at the convention surrounded by adults they should have realized I was vulnerable and somebody, anybody, should have made an effort to stand up for me, to speak up for me, to protect me. Nobody did.

Going off on my own across country, on a flight alone and in a hotel room alone and getting around alone - it was totally awesome. Gary freaking Gygax was there! There was a giant room of games! These were my people, maybe I could make friends here! It could have been a triumph. It could have shown me that I was strong and could trust myself and could be out in the world, I didn't have to just be shy and afraid. It could have helped me trust my interests in life. Me, a shy kid who didn't fit in - I should have been able to fit in here. And there was some evidence of that - they guys who created Ace of Aces were really nice to me and treated me as an equal, sure they wanted to sell their game, but it was a really cool game and I enjoyed playing. But now with getting killed off and then laughed at by everyone behind my back, the whole room of people I wanted to like me and wanted to let me fit in with -- the shame and humiliation overcame the positive.

For the rest of my life - I'm now 54 - this experience has stayed with me. Being an outsider, not fitting in, taking risks then just getting humiliated - I see this has happened as a pattern. So GenCon Top Secret definitely wasn't the only experience of bullying I had, and it definitely wasn't the only event that was traumatic when I went out on my own in the world, Sure my parents could have done a much better job protecting me maybe.

But getting bullied like that in a role playing game I desperately wanted to play - I loved secret agents - in a community that should have been my home - role playing games - it ended up being more proof in my heart. Proof that I had to just stay shy and hold back and not trust and be on the outside because life just bullies you when you try. It was one brick in the wall of a trauma for me (also a big Pink Floyd fan). I carry this memory with me every day as one scar among many, along with all the other bricks in my wall.

I've done a lot of personal emotional work to heal my childhood wounds. I'm a gamer these days. I put myself out there and I'm no longer shy. But as anyone who lives with trauma and bullying knows, you never can heal completely, these experiences as children shape us deeply. And they build up. Especially on life events that are exceptional - like the first trip away from home as a kid - even a single trauma can have huge effects.

It's not that I want to blame this one incident for troubles in my life. My life has been great and I have a lot of freedom from the trauma patterns and limitations that I carried a lot when I was younger. I have healed. But I also wonder: what would it have been like if just one person from that group had noticed me and tried to help me? What if one person from that group had left the room and caught up with me, and said ""Hey, you know, that was wrong you had to roll damage from a jump, the rules are that falls, not jumps, cause damage. You know, that gamemaster is a jerk, why don't you join our game later, our GM is awesome and we have a younger player with us who you might like."" What if just one person had seen me, had seen what happened, had stood up for me and helped me? What if I was given some validation and encouragement, and instead of not signing up for any other games, what if I had found the strength to play, and what if I then had some good experiences playing and even made some friends and GenCon? Could it have made a difference if someone had helped me? And who knows, could it maybe even have made a huge difference for the course of the rest of my life?

So when you see a young player at a convention, in your online group, at the game store game night - please. Take some responsibility as an adult. Kids need us, they need us to help keep them protected and safe. Not just from the obvious dangers for young teens out in the world, but from the seeming smaller incidents of ridicule, or teasing, or being laughed at, or being bullied, or being tricked. Like me they might be shy and silent, they might not speak up, but maybe they need protection from feeling hurt and vulnerable and sensitive inside. You might think it's not a big deal, but that kid might really, really, be vulnerable. Without protection they might grow up and struggle for decades to heal.

The kindness and caring you show might make a difference, even a huge difference, maybe even change the course of their life.

32,63,lmmasq,"REMINDER: Just because this sub dislikes D&D doesn't mean you should avoid it. In fact, it's a good RPG to get started with!","People here like bashing D&D because its popularity is out of proportion with the system's quality, and is perceived as ""taking away"" players from their own pet system, but it is not a bad game. The ""crunch"" that often gets referred to is by no means overwhelming or unmanageable, and in fact I kind of prefer it to many ""rules-light"" systems that shift their crunch to things that, IMO, shouldn't have it (codifying RP through dice mechanics? Eh, not a fan.)

Honestly, D&D is a great spot for new RPG players to start and then decide where to go from. It's about middle of the road in terms of crunch/fluff while remaining easy to run and play, and after playing it you can decide ""okay that was neat, but I wish there were less rules getting in the way"", and you can transition into Dungeon World, or maybe you think that fiddling with the mechanics to do fun and interesting things is more your speed, and you can look more at Pathfinder. Or you can say ""actually this is great, I like this"", and just keep playing D&D.

Beyond this, D&D is a massively popular system, which is a **strength**, not a reason to avoid it. There is an abundance of tools and resources online to make running and playing the system easier, a wealth of free adventures and modules and high quality homebrew content, and many games and players to actually play the game with, which might not be the case for an Ars Magica or Genesys. For a new player without an established group, this might be the single most important argument in D&D5E's favor. 

So don't feel like you have to avoid D&D because of the salt against it on this sub. D&D 5E is a good system. Is it the best system? I would argue there's no single ""best"" system except the one that is best for you and your friends, and D&D is a great place to get started finding that system.

39,78,128zaai,One of my players said some very uncomfortable things and I don't know what to do,"[Marked NSFW for mention of rape]

I GM a Pathfinder 2e table every Saturday (if there's no scheduling problems). Today, before starting the session, I was talking to the players (there are four of them plus me as the GM) how I wanted to change the day of the sessions because of our players wasn't able to come because of her boss.

One player, which I'll call V, starting talking about how tables where the GM gives too much freedom to players never go well, using one the players (I'll call him K) as an example, because K was new to the system as wanted to make some kinda wild characters.

V and K already had disagreements before, with V complaining that K wasn't ""helping the party"", alongside another player, which even interrupted a session before it began once. However, after that, V starting using other examples outside RPG... specifically, ""forced"" representation of queer characters, which, *in his own words*, ""hurt the ego of straight viewers"".

When I asked him to elaborate, he gave a half-assed explanation about including women and minorities where they ""don't belong"", such as in the show Vikings and in the live-action Little Mermaid. He also said (I think, my hearing kinda fails me sometimes) that the Little Mermaid actress ""didn't act black"".

He also said the Disney was putting this actress under fire, because making a white character black will obviously cause blacklash directed to her. And he also talked about corporations just using minorities to make money. These two points I agree... but then he followed up the second point by saying ""woke culture"" was ruining TTRPGs because Pathfinder's official adventures didn't include rape or slavery.

I tried to calmly explain to him that, while the adventures have lots of graphic violence, those two topics are usually more sensible, and the GM can always include or exclude any topic if the players feel or don't feel comfortable. But he just kept saying Paizo was a hypocrite.

Needless to say, we were *very* uncomfortable with what he said. I proceeded with the session, until V had to leave and we didn't have enough players to continue.
Honestly, I don't even know what to do at this point. He already lashed out against the players before because they weren't ""playing their roles right"". While I agree they made major mistakes before, V still lashed out very angrily (even DMing me saying he was carrying the party), even though this is just a game, and today was even worse.

Should I talk to him about this? He will probably not change his opinion, but I don't know if banning him outright is the best option. What do you guys think?

41,82,a3nkxw,"Our group just has to kick ""that guy"" out of the group, and it sucked because he is/was a friend. [Rant/Bemoan & Group Conflict stories here, I suppose]","First of all, sorry if my writing is janky, I'm on my phone and I suck at phone typing. 

So I've been playing with roughly the same tabletop rpg group for five years (D&D mostly, but other systems too) and this week 5 of our 6 members finally broke the news to Mr. 6.

Overall, I've been blessed with a very stable and rich group experience for most of my tabletop career, but I've gotta say, this is easily the worst experience I've had in the last 11 years with RPGs. I came here to vent and warn you all... communication is key, but some differences are irreconcilable.

4 of our 6 players, including me and my fiance, work together. Mr. 6 is also in that group of 4. The other 2 are old friends from college who moved back to town after graduating. They're return acted as the catalyst that led to this week's events. Before that it was just the four of us, scrapping up fun on short, ramshackle campaigns. Some were good, others fell apart. 

Our standards were low, and while gaming was overall a positive experience, this group's campaigns were never anything too memorable. The problems with Mr 6. started back then, but with only 4 players, we simply endured.

Now that the foundation is set, let me elaborate about our issues with Mr. 6.

1. He absolutely cannot roleplay. At best he identifies a single character trait that his character has, and only pursues that one angle. In other words: he plays a gimmick. Also, because he can't roleplay, all of his character knowledge is player knowledge, unless we police him.

2. He's a min-maxer. Almost every single character option he chooses has a numerical benefit that aids in his gimmick mentioned above. He also cannot recognize the fact he min-maxs everything. A recent character of his was defended with his logic that ""My character is balanced because he has a really low stat to even out his really high stat!"" Completely unaware that is pretty close to the definition of min-maxing.

3. He gets upset anytime his character underperforms in battle or anytime his plot or puzzle assumptions aren't correct. So if he misses more than twice in a row, he checks out. If he assumes a certain NPC is up to something and he's proven wrong, he checks out. If he doesn't ""get"" a puzzle? Checks out. Basically, if he doesn't do awesome, he gets grumbly and jumps on his phone .

4. He cheats. (In fairness, He's gotten better through the years). He used to reroll his dice if he rolled poorly and he thought the dm was distracted and didn't see him roll. Hes been confronted about this though, and now tends to rely on rolling behind debris on the table and scooping up his dice before we can confirm his roll, or ""forgetting what he rolled"" after scooping his dice back up. He's also been fond of inflating modifiers, but I tend to shadow calculate his rolls and call him on it when it happens, so he's backed away from that method.

5. He cannot stay focused. In game he will regularly start interrupting combats or roleplaying with anecdotes relating to recent news or pop culture events. This mostly happens when a different player/character has roleplaying challenge where he is not directly involved, or during a combat where he is doing poorly.

Ok. *sigh*

While issues 1 and 2 are probably the most frustrating with our group, I want to make it clear that those are valid forms of gameplay. Some people can't roleplay well, and some campaigns or systems really expect you to number-crunch for every advantage. We get that. It's just unfortunate that our group has really grown into roleplaying and storytelling, and he just doesn't mesh with our group anymore. Its almost not his fault, he's in his 60s, he grew up with OD&D and AD&D 1st edition. He's Gygaxian. 

While issues 1 and 2 drag the fun down, he's still a coworker and friend, so we could tolerate it... in theory. The bottom line when it came down to deciding he's out are issues 3 and 5. It's not just his in-game performance, it's his around-the-table attitude. (Honeatly issue 4, the cheating, only happens once every few sessions, so that's our lowest concern). 

It's just that 2 years ago my college friends came back and they introduced some honest-to-goodness standards into our group, and our entire groups roleplaying has really taken off! Except Mr. 6. It's gotten to the point where we all are having fun, until he interrupts the bard's intense infiltration/bluff mission with an anecdote about ""how political correctness is ect. ect. ect."". Or he's just start trying to share funny cat videos during combat, those sort of thing. He's dragging the mood down.

Well, this last shift change (our shifts change every 6 months), he couldn't make it work and bowed out. And our group realized something around 10 sessions in... we are having way more fun now.

So it was decided that we would break the news to him this week. Unfortunately, communication was... poor. And essentially he was told 3 separate things by 3 separate players, all at different times. One told him that he just wouldn't fit in the current campaign, and maybe something would work 6 months from now. Another player went with brutal honesty and told him he just can't roleplay and doesn't work with the group anymore. I had told him something in between those two answers. 

It was a mess. None of us wanted him to get hurt, because at the end of the day he is still a coworker and a friend. In our defense we didn't pull this from nowhere. He's been talked to numerous times over the years, the cheating, the interrupting, the lack of roleplaying... none of it has changed with him.

It just felt so good playing without him. Without the constant immersion breaks. But now I feel like crap. And I can't sleep.

How did/do you deal with problem players? I would very much like to hear your experiences or opinions on these sort of events?

Lastly, I was going to post this on r/dnd, but its not really about that game in particular... am I correct in assuming this belongs here? Sorry, new to this sub...

Then one day I just made one up, in a cafe. We were sat there, and I started telling a story. I asked if she wanted to make a character for the story. Then, I asked how her character would react. She fought a giant frog, and was hooked. The only rules were that she had five health, and she had to roll a 4-6 if she wanted to do something she might fail at.

It's now a few months later. We've added some more rules.  She loves her character and I've learned a lot about my little girl. She's kind, diplomatic, funny, brave and very imaginative. We've created a world together that we both care about. She's rescued friends, caught thieves and psychoanalysed a demon. She has her own little book, where she writes down what's been happening.

It's wonderful, and something I will always remember. I made a map of [the world we've made, here :)](http://imgur.com/sGgsY0I)

47,92,sqsugg,All my players are dead and I didn't tell them.,"I did a very bad job as gm. Three months ago, my players were scouting a caravan and suddenly they fell in a goblin ambush. I didn't manage the fight correctly and it was basically a tpk.I think the greatest problem was that the fight began at the ending of one session and continued at the beginning of another, so I didn't know what to do after the tpk.

In a panic, I just rolled with it, they woke up as if dreaming and the caravan went on.The town was weird. My wizard noted that everyone that they met had a familiar face, but they failed all the insights tests that I gave them, so they thought that was just a strange coincidence.

In the next session, I went a little overboard. I dug into their backstories and noted everything that could be useful and uncommon, old allies, dead family, etc.

The city mayor offered them a household as a reward for their protection, so they had a reason to stick around. The bard had a sad backstory about how his father disappeared years ago. Imagine his surprise when a letter in his father's handwriting was waiting for them in the new house. Following the letter's instructions, they found a strange cave where surreal things were going on; floating skulls, visions of their past adventures, old allies on the walls crying.

The bard had an encounter with his father, who appeared as a white angel projection thing. They had a cute moment and all the time the father was saying metaphors of ""you need to go on"", ""rest your soul"", ""go on with your existence"" kind of thing. In that session, I stopped using the word life.

Going back to town, they found a place exactly like the field where they fought the goblins. I made sure to use the same words to describe the battleground. There they found the bodies of dead adventurers the same class as them. This was kind of dead in the nose, but they are stupid.The bodies woke up and fought them. All the fight they were saying secrets that only the players would know and calling them sinners that would soon be forgotten.

A lot happened after that. They started seeing strange creatures that resemble angels of the bible, a lot of animals that I made sure to describe as ancient or extinct, strange people that seemed out of place, they never saw goblins again, etc.

It has come to a point that I do not know anymore how to tell them that they are dead in a subtle way, they played this characters for over a year, I feel sad to let them go.

UPDATE:  I'm really thankful for every comment on this post. I've decided to keep them going in this post-death state to explore the weird themes that are hard to display in normal fantasy, thinking of Spec Ops The Line or Planetscape Torment to draw inspiration from. 

There are just some things that are still left in the open. What if they die again?

I have a lot of anxiety problems when things go off the rails, and when they do I panic and improvise too much, the kind of improvisation that, simply saying, destroy plots. 

Until now, they haven't tried to leave the village. I will probably make them go out in the next session and start giving more clear hints that there is nowhere left to go.

So far I have done a survey of students to find out who has experience and who is interested in DMing. I have also setup a Google Classroom with resources that will be beneficial for new and experienced players.

EDIT: wow the response to this has been huge! I am getting lots of great advice and hearing stories about other people's experiences. And folks saying this is inspiring them to start a club at their schools is one of the best things I have heard.

Folks have been DMing me offering me access to resources they have, one-shots, premade characters, etc. Others have even made cash donations to help with the purchase of books and dice. What an amazing and kind community D&D can be and I am happy that we get to help youth discover it for themselves.",rpg,1663966893.0,0,1479,279

52,102,1cpupus,"Hey, it's me, the guy at your table who only wants to play D&D. After three years of trying other systems, now I get what my problem is.","So I'll be the first to admit I'm exactly the kind of player who makes it hard for you, the person reading this, to play other games. I'm sorry! I've been playing one campaign or another since mid-2014, which is exactly long enough to experience a decade in the hobby without ever needing to play something other than 5E.

But I've been lucky! Of the two main groups I'm in one has never broken away from 5e, but another started branching out into other systems three years back because of the DM's burnout. I'm glad we did, despite all my stubborness along the way. Of the last three years, one was spent entirely on a level 1-10 campaign of Pathfinder 2E, with the other two years jumping between Shadowdark, Mork Borg, Blades in the Dark, Monster of the Week, and finally a Heart: the City Beneath campaign that's ending next week — I haven't  cared much for any of them, though PF2 was probably my favorite of the bunch. I'm probably going to politely bow out of this group before the next campaign in favor of a second 5e table, since I know I'm no more likely to enjoy the next thing they decide to play.

But now I know for sure it's not them. ""Them"" being the other systems, though the other players aren't at fault either. It's me.

There was a time when I would have said I don't have the time to learn other systems. The truth is, I like playing 5E because it asks the least effort out of me. This is fundamentally different from being a hard system to master, because with the exception of PF2E, all the other systems I've tried are less mechanically demanding. Its that D&D 5e is, by far, the system I can put the least amount of effort into while still being an active contributor at the table.

Our GM pitched Mork Borg, and then Shadowdark, by talking a lot about Old School D&D and the movements behind it, with the player-facing problem solving and the lack of solutions ""on the character sheet."" The thing is, I LIKE the solutions being on the character sheet. I don't really mind how lethal those systems are, but I immediately missed being able to solve a problem by rolling the right skill for it. Outside of combat, those OSR games feel more like your DM is running you through an escape room with the amount of time you spend asking questions about the environment and trying to figure out what gets you through dungeons. If I'm playing a character who is a thief, it's because I want the skills for being good at a thief on my table so I can roll to do ""thief things"" when I need to and carry on with the night.

Same with BitD/MotW/Heart, but from a different angle. Those games DO put your skills on the sheet, but the way the conversation plays out at the table is constantly demanding improv on everything else. I was constantly getting frustrated with the DM turning the questions of how I was doing things back on me, and how much those games demand you to narrate things outside of what your character does.

PF2 is close to 5E, but building out the combat the way it does put too much pressure on me most the time to really figure out what was going on in combat and make tactical decisions and use three actions ""wisely."" Most classes in 5E have one, maybe two things they do on their turn, and once you learn them you almost always know what to do when it gets around to you.

And I know that sounds bad. I know! I know this basically all sounds like ""you prefer 5E to these other games because you have to actually try to play them?"" But the answer is actually yeah, exactly! It's not that I'm checked out on my phone or something, but I've learned I'm not actually interested in thinking too much about my part at the table. I think being there at game night with friends is fun, but I mostly just want to be along for the ride until it's time to roll some dice to hit something and let the other players figure out what to do otherwise, maybe get in some banter-in character in between encounters, and chill. In everything else I've played, I'm dead weight if I'm not actively participating. In 5E, I can just kind of vibe until it's time to roll to unlock a door or stab someone, and I'm not penalized for doing that. The game is neither loose enough that it needs my constant imput outside of combat, nor complex enough to need any serious tactical decisions. That's a very comfortable spot for me!

So yeah. I imagine there's a lot of players who would prefer other systems if they tried them, but I'm not one of them. And I imagine there's actually a lot more people like me at tables than you'd expect! Hopefully this gives some insight into why someone would still prefer 5E over everything else, even after giving a lot of other games a shot.

Because even if you're a huge company like Shopify it's damn near impossible to build all the edge cases for your users' needs in-house. It's much easier to build a solid API that they can build themselves or hire someone to build for them.

54,106,xr7nfx,The Hollow Knight RPG is really freaking good you guys,"I was looking through the hollow knight subreddit, when I found this gem:

https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/r406lw/introducing_the_unofficial_hollow_knight_ttrpg/

I’ve read through the pdf and played with some characters, and holy fuck this game is good. The racial system of managing different modular traits is really sick, and the martial classes in this game are actually really good. Also it’s about bugs, which is based.

It’s got a really great action economy system with stamina, a resource used to make attacks. Each character has 3 stamina plus 1 for each level in a martial path. You use stamina for attacks, dodging, extra movement, and more. Each attack will cost more stamina for every attack you have already made this turn, so action economy doesn’t spiral out of control. Your stamina regenerates at the start of each turn

The stamina system achieves a couple of things:

1. It makes martials more defensive, since they have more resources to dodge with

2. It give more strategy in combat, since there is a trade off between defensive stamina use and spending stamina on offence

3. I allows casters more nuanced and balanced control options. Instead of binary save of suck options, most spells will instead drain stamina from enemies, like one spell that grapples targets with vines, with it costing 2 stamina to attempt an escape.

Did I mention natural weapons are good and varied in this game, it has a good alchemist class, a good trap based class, and a good poison based class?


This game has all the things I wish that other chunky RPGs like dnd had.

Even if you’ve never played hollow knight, this is worth checking out.",rpg,1664457500.0,0,1665,274
55,107,18d80q,"Okay, everyone wanted more detail about the F.A.T.A.L. session, here you go.  [NSFW]. [NSFL]. [NS].  Seriously... do not read. ","Since everybody wants it, I'll post what I recall about the session of F.A.T.A.L. we played.  It's been years so my memory is (thankfully) pretty fuzzy but here goes.

First, everyone showed up EXCEPT Jordon-who's-fault-this-whole-thing-was.  After phoning him up we learned that he'd been called in to work and would be late, but he told us it was okay and to just start without him.  Bastard.  So we started, and right from the get-go it was horrible.  There are primary stats in F.A.T.A.L., each of which is the average of some sub-stats, five I think.  Each sub stat is generated by rolling (4d100/2)-1.  Yep.  I sure hope you love doing averages in your head because you have to about 100 times to make a F.A.T.A.L. character.  Anyway you generate all of these substats by doing the above roll a LOT (even now that equation is seared into my memory, years later) and then you average each set of sub-stats to get each main stat.  Imagine what the room was like trying to get 10 people who'd never played this game to roll that many dice and do that much math in their heads or longhand.  It was chaos.  Yes we could have used calculators but I DID NOT ALLOW IT.  If I had to GM this pig they could do the fucking math the hard way.  Anyway that took about a fucking hour, mostly because I had to keep explaining it to them.  Then Jordan showed up.

He breezed in like it was no problem and had a hearty laugh at our expense, apologized for being so late, and told us to just go ahead and finish up without him.  ""Oh no.  No you sit your fucking ass down and catch up with us you greasy shithumper.  This whole thing is because of YOU!!"" We all said with our eyes (and some of us said it with our mouths too) while we fetched pencils and a blank sheet.  Now that we'd all done it, it went pretty well and after about 15 minutes he was all caught up.  Poor bastard.

Now came the ""skill modifiers"".  You have to look up each stat and find the skill modifier for skills keyed off of that stat.  They're mostly the same but the table is reprinted separately for each ability.  Seriously, there's like 40 pages of nearly identical tables after the stats section for these skill modifiers.  Also each entry on the table has a ""description"" that I think you're supposed to write down,  I don't remember.  I do remember that one of the descriptors for one of the dex-like stats was ""physical movement precision"" and it was all in fractions of an inch.  Retarded.  Some of that stats of course have multiple modifiers like ""maximum speech rate"" which is based off your enunciation stat which is naturally vitally important for casters.  Blerf. One of the characters' had for his language modifier ""undismayed"".  Also there is a rule for ""retard strength"" if a character's intelligence is below 70, so there's that.  (Of course nobody in my group qualified for said retard strength because the stats are so averaged, but it says a lot about the game that it's there, and that it's called ""retard strength.)

About now you're probably thinking ""this isn't so bad, sure the math is overly complex and the bizarre prediliction for averages will result in nearly-identical stats for most characters but it isn't all *horrible* or anything. You're right, at this point it isn't too bad... Leave now.  Seriously.  Stop reading this thread and go to /r/aww for a  while and never  come back.  You'll be better off for the rest of your life if you do, I'm not kidding.

Okay you chose poorly.   So next everybody chose their gender and race.   Under gender there's a whole bit where he basically recapitulates Aristotle's opinions on the differences between the sexes, and gives you modifiers to the stats based on them.  It's pretty sexist but not nearly as bad as you would expect based on the stuff you'll be putting on your character sheet in a few minutes so I gotta give props.  Now you just pick your race and apply the racial modifiers to your stats and you're done with statsOHWAITNOTREALLY!  Now a bunch of your secondary stats have changed haven't they? Guess what that means!  You get to re-average everything to re-derive your primary stats now, isn't that awesome!  Isn't it great that we get to do that all over again?  Interestingly enough there's a paragraph where the author apologizes for using the term ""race"" as that might be deemed inappropriate.  Bear in mind in a little bit you'll be generating the circumference of your asshole to determine how much dong it takes you rape you to death, so being concerned about the term ""race"" is... odd.  Anyway we did all of this without too much difficulty, just some groaning about having to re-derive all 20 (or whatever) stats.  Each race also has a few skill modifiers to jot down and some of them have random traits or special powers.  After the races were all chosen everyone had to record their races various hatreds for the other members of the group based on the race-hate table.  I also suggested that if their character had a particularly high racial hatred for another character's race they could note some of the racial slurs in the helpful list the game includes (One of which is ""stovepiper"" based on the thick dicks one of the races has, I forget which.)

The next chapter was called ""Body"" and is just page after page of tables to determine height, weight, hair color, all that bullshit.  It took us quite a while because it's needlessly detailed and largely nonsensical.  There are tables for everything.  I do remember we had a good laugh at the best feature/worst feature roll.  I think we had a Dwarf with really nice hair but whose worst feature was ""crotch"" so we ruled he was just really really hairy *everywhere*.  Good times.  There's also some  really critical shit in this chapter determined by single die rolls.  for example you roll percentile on the vision quality table at one point and if you roll low you're mostly blind and suck at hitting stuff. One of the players had already decided due to his stats to be mostly ranged but it turned out he couldn't see very well.  Sucked to be that guy.  

Then we hit the stuff F.A.T.A.L. is famous for.

Partway through the body chapter you run into the section about sexual characteristics.  They were just following along and and I said ""okay, now everybody roll for areaola diameter"".  You could have heard a pin drop for about 2 seconds and then laughter and chaos.   Once I got them calmed down they all rolled for that (modified by race of course) then areaola color and hue, then cup size and nipple *length*.  It was hilarious and deeply disturbing at the same time.  The results were hilarious, we were going around the table rolling for each thing and just cracking up laughing at every roll.   We had a troll with enourmous nipples and areaolas like appetizer plates but AA cup breasts.  One guy had a tongue that could touch the top of his nose.  Yes TOP, not tip.  He could almost lick his own eyebrows. Then there's vaginal circumference and depth, which is based on height if I recall correctly with a random percentage added on and then modified by race.  There are even modifiers to VCP based on whether the character is a mother, a nymphmaniac, or a slut.  FYI The modifier to vaginal circumference for being a slut is larger than the one for having given birth, ladies take note.  There's a similar table for ACP (anal circumference, potential) and that was fun for all because everybody has an anus, not everybody has a vagina.  We did some rough comparison and decided that one of the characters could possibly fit another completely inside their anus.  An immediate plan was hatched in case the larger player was ever sent to jail to smuggle the other one inside the larger's anus.  This is the kind of discussion you have while playing this game.  There's even a ""hymen penetration"" or ""hymen resistance"" table, I can't recall the exact name thank god.  There's a bunch of shit about menstruation and fertility rates and such.  Then we (mostly male players) got to the part we'd been waiting for: dicks. EDIT: shit, I forgot to mention this: on vaginal circumference there is a handy ""reference"" column that compares the various vagina size classes to the number of same-species fingers and/or fists that can be inserted therein.  Wow.

I always thought the game environment as a safe, creative and fantastic.

But my parents moved to another state, and I decided to hit the local store to find a group. What I found baffled me at the time. Several men, most around the age of my uncle, that treated me (13 year old at the time) in a condescending and *lecherous* manner. I fled that place. But I haven't given up the game, I found out the older brother of a school friend played, and was set up a game with them, it seemed all cool, until all his friends started hitting on my character in game, all the time. I didn't come for another session.

I was 15 and really into the Vampire: the masquerade when I decided to give RPGs another go, this time as a game master. I found a group willing to play at school and we started it. First I took the horror part pretty seriously, but it seems like at 15 all people want to do when playing vampire is to stuck fangs and pick fights.  I took it back to dungeons and dragons, and it worked out for some time. 

When I had to move again, this time for college, it was when things took another uglier turn. I met the gatekeepers of all things geek. I tried to join an rpg community at college, but apparently my vagina was an horrible flaw and at the same time the most wanted thing at the place. 

I spent my first year setting my dog to chase after any of those douches everytime I had the misfortune to cross paths with them.

By the middle of second year I had found other like minded people and we formed a group that would run one shots of several different systems, for we had highly incompatible schedules (different courses and years) and I finally found the people to play with: the underdogs of underdogs, the picked on feminine gay, that weird/ugly girl, the pretty gal that can't play because of the harassment, the autistic guy.

67,129,jum5wd,"I just GM'ed my first RPG and wow, I have so much more respect for people who regularly gm now","Hello hello~
As the title suggests, I GM'ed my first RPG today. ☺️
Until now I was just a player, but WHEW, being GM is a whole other world. 
We played ""kids on brooms"", so I had to come up with the full story. Which led to me writing old diary entries/ love letters in the breaks to plant as hints for my players to discover. 

So here are some things I did NOT expect to go like this. 

1. How much they would derail my story. I know, I KNOW, it always happens but -they. Just. Didn't go to any of the places I had hinted at, and even interrupted my NPC when they were about to get useful information from him 😭
I invented like 10 new NPCs and several new settings  and just... Tried to gently nudge them into the direction the story was supposed to be heading. 
2. How hard it is to just sit by and stay silent while waiting for the players to figure shit out.  I hope I didn't budge in too much to bring their attention to any details in the hints they missed. 
3. I also did not expect all that lowkey sexual tension. Two players played star students of their school, one of them from a rich ancient family, the other the perfect prefect. They decided beforehand their characters didn't like each other but... They just went head to head all the time, trading insults an riling each other up. 
Maybe the words: ""scared, potter?"" Where uttered by one of them bc it just fit so perfectly 😭
4. How exhausted I would be. Seriously, if you are somebody who regularly GM's... You're a champ, thanks for putting all of that work into it for your players. 
I'll definitely tell MY GM's how much I appreciate all their work. 

So yeah. That's how my first time mastering a game went 😬",rpg,1605448301.0,0,1680,321
68,131,r9esfb,"Three sessions in, and one of my players has TPKed the rest of the party","So, recently I started a new campaign with some friends. One of my players - lets call him Mike - created this sortof Judge Dredd character. For better or worse, he takes this role very seriously, and as a result has been trying to find excuses to kill the rest of the party for any crime, real or imagined.

In the first session, one player missed 4 attacks in a row against an enemy. Mike attempted to use this as proof that they were colluding with the enemy, and shot him (non-fatally).

In the second session, two players decided to take a detour from the main mission to do some personal errands. Again, Mike decided that this was unacceptable - that the mission should always come first, and (again) strongly insinuated that he would kill them both if they didn't fall in line.

In the last session, Mike finally managed to pull a TPK off against the entire rest of the team. While the party was trapped in a pitch black room, some of the players were passing notes, and Mike decided that this was the final straw - evidently the rest of the party was colluding against him. He managed to find the lever to open the escape hatch, dropped out, then threw a pack of grenades back into the room, killing everyone.

69,133,xfwq5x,"My epiphany: Whiff up, not down.","There are probably people or even game systems that recommend this, but I hadn't seen this idea before and it seems so broadly applicable that I though it was worth sharing: Whiff up, not down -- and by that, I mean, when you blow a roll which normally means spectacular failure, use the opportunity to describe how competent the foe or challenge is, not how the action itself was poor.

I expect a lot of us had had many situations where you horribly miss an attack or a save or a check or whatever, and the default reaction is to describe it as an amateurish or laughable effort -- the orc warrior comes at the PC and rolls a 2 for her attack (she practically dropped her sword!) or the rogue flubs the saving throw against the trap (they didn't even see or hear the darts as they launched from the hole in the wall!). But by doing this, you cheapen the challenge and drag everyone down, narratively speaking.

Instead, use the botch to describe how impressive those involved are. ""The orc's sword swing was almost lazy with confidence from probably having cut through dozens of militia with same powerful cut, but as you parry it, you see the glint in her eye as she smiles and adjusts her stance, recognizing a foe worth her time"".  ""You hear the darts and begin to drop out of the way before the first two even clear the hole, but as you are about to hit the ground you see the third dart, intentionally aimed low and wide, just as it hits your leg: this trap was designed by someone who knew what they where doing"".

Then when the players succeed, they will feel that the foes were worthy challenges -- or if they fail, that their fate may have been deserved against such competence. And the advice isn't limited to GMs. As a player, the more you glow up your opponent, the more epic the encounter will be.

And yes, there are certainly characters or situations or games where incompetence is the shtick, so in those embrace the clown show. But for games about heroes or epic deeds or tough challenges, it usually behooves everyone at the table to embellish, not denigrate, their opposition.",rpg,1663347520.0,0,2097,382

One of the reasons I'm usually the GM is that many people are scared about being it.  
People think they're not good enough, don't know the system well enough, or lots of other reasons.  
This means all the ""Be a better GM"" tips would be great, right?  
I've developed the opposite view. All these guides and attitude does is pushing more and more responsibility to one person at the table.

If you're 5 people at the table, why should 1 of you be responsibile for 90% of the fun. I feel this attitude is prevalent among lots of people. Players sit down and expect to be entertained while the GM is pressured to keep the game going with pacing, intrigue, fun, rules and so on.

If you're a new GM, why should you feel bad for not knowing a rule if none of the players know it?  
If the table goes quiet because no one interacts with each other, why is it the GM's job to fix it?  
If the pacing sucks, why is it the GM's fault? I'd bet that in most cases pacing sucks when the players aren't contributing enough.

I'd love to see some guides and lists on ""How to be a better RPG group"".

Since this Gofundme started, Rick has been in ICU and we have been unable to really speak to him. Yesterday his was able to have visitors, and his sisters spent quite a few hours with him and bring up to date on family matters and they told him about the wonderful response he was getting from his friends and comrades in the gaming community to the Gofundme. He was very relived to hear that some of his bills were going to be taken care of and certainly helped diminish some of his worries about his sisters and it lifted his spirits!

Today I spent several hours with Rick to discuss and ask about various business matters. Of course his first question to me when I arrived was ""How much is it now?"" ""A bit over $25,000 , I told him.""

The most wonderful thing about my visit was that I sat with him and read almost every comment that you had all posted in the comments section. Rick got comments from Spain, Japan, The Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, the UK, Australia, Mexico and others. I would tell him the country if the commenter had listed it. He had not heard or read any of those yet, and he recognized many of your names. There were certainly times that some of your comments brought tears to his eyes, and he would often comment ""how gratifying it was to hear such things being said about me.""

So now I can confirm that Rick has indeed heard your comments and is very, very grateful and humbled by your outpouring of care and love!

Finally it was time for me to leave and Rick asked ""What is it now?"" I got my phone and checked. ""Wow, its $27,000 Rick!"" He smiled. ""See you tomorrow?"" ""Ok - I'll stop by to keep you updated."" I replied.

I created a small website with different kind of name generators.
You can find it at the following address:
 
https://alxgiraud.github.io/fantasygen

The first tab uses **Markov chain procedural algorithm** to make coherent chains of values.

You can use the existing presets but also customize the dictionary. This algorithm can generate any kind of word (e. g. NPC names, towns, planets, monsters, religions, etc.).

You can customized the expected result. A lower order will increase the randomness. 

The other tabs (except Taverns) mostly use guidelines from **Gary Gygax's Extraordinary Book of Names**.

**Generic Fantasy** tab generates random names that can be used for any generic character names (heroes, villains, main protagonist, etc.).

**Fantastic Species** tab generates names for a specific race. 
You may find two alternatives for a same species. It could be useful to distinguishing two different kind of populations/tribes (e. g. Wood and High elves).

**Groups** tab generates names for Mystic Orders, Military Units and Thieves & Assassin group. They could also be used for any group of adventurers or guilds.

**Taverns** tab generates... well... tavern names. I simply implement what is defined on this D&D wiki page: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Well_Over_100_Tavern_Names_(DnD_Other)#Totally_Random

So uh, yeah. This is a project that ballooned in scope a bit.

I'm proud to present Dataterm, a ""in-universe"" website for my game of the Cyberpunk Red tabletop RPG. The setting for it is Montréal, Canada in the year 2023. It is set in my interpretation of the universe of the old-school RPG Cyberpunk 2020. Currently, my players are on warpath after being fired as police detectives, after the megacorporation they were investigating managed to meddle and find loopholes in the law to get them out of police protection.

&nbsp;

On Dataterm, I wanted my players to have access to the daily ""screamsheets"" (constantly updated newspaper printed on cheap thermal paper) as well as the ""Public Database"", a NET aggregator that allows them to look up things in the lore. If you speak Molière's language, feel free to read those parts of the website! I love writing that stuff.

&nbsp;

On the English version, you'll find a few of the screamsheets I translated as well as *some* homebrew content on a few enemy NPC ideas I had running around in my head.

You'll notice a few of the things that I do to convey worldbuilding AND game information. The ads on the website use game mechanics to tell players how to use these products as well as tell them how they work within the setting. The ""screamsheets"" themselves allow me to push these ads with interesting info, as well as tidbits of worldbuilding information. In addition, most of the articles on these screamsheets are linked in some way to what they do in their campaign: the articles report on shoot outs they took part in, events that they know details about and even, sometimes, people they have met.

&nbsp;

The website doesn't have much on it yet, but my ambition is to slowly build it into a great platform for homebrew content and community resources for the Cyberpunk Red community. It's a very unique setting and the community is only now exploding, so this is my way of giving back to the community.

Finally, yesterday I ran CoC 7e The haunting oneshot for other group of friends (who never played TTRPG before!)...We expected 4 hours most, but it went for 7 hours, till 3:00, we were sleepy but everyone wanted to solve the mystery and get rid of Corbitt! It was a murderhouse, PCs got killed 4 times due to unlucky rolls and overconfidence. 

It was really refreshing, for the first time for a long time I've felt something new, and the rules... They actually supported the story!  And the fighting, it felt so dynamic, the way every conflicting side during the attack can have some sort of an action felt interesting, and it worked quite nicely. I didn't expect that, I got used to one-sided turns in D&D

It felt so fluid and even strange. Because I came to the point on my 1.5 years of my D&D career, where only 20% of my games are actual combat, but 80% of the rules of D&D are about the combat! 


Now I just...Want to stop my campaign with all kinds of stories in it? And just grab different systems and play short campaigns, so every system I'd use would be honed for a particular story, like for 2-3 months each. 

Sadly...I am afraid, I can't force myself tell my players that I want to stop. They really enjoy my games, and we just started a new campaign like 1.5 months ago. I know that half of them wouldn't switch and prefer to leave the table. I am afraid that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Because I love my players :(

85,162,2oa9bg,[D&D 3.5] I had the absolute worst session ever last night.,"About a week ago the brother of a co-worker of mine invited me to play in his group's new D&D 3.5 campaign. I already have a regular Pathfinder game but I figured why the heck not? Make new friends, be able to game more, yay! :D

I rolled up a third level rogue and went over to the DM's house (not the guy who invited me) ready to play. The group was all men older than me (mid-20s), four of them including the DM. After being introduced to everyone I felt really good about this because they all seemed very nice and also excited to a.) have a new player and b.) finally have a rogue in the group.

What. A. Total. Disaster.

First of all, the DM didn't know the rules. For example: we opened with a combat (no role-playing or setup, he literally just dropped us into a combat). I had the initiative so I went to backstab one of the orcs who we had stumbled across. The DM said I couldn't backstab him because I wasn't behind him. I told him that he was flat-footed so I could backstab him.

Player 1: ""Oh here we go, she's a rules lawyer guys...""

??? A ""rules lawyer""? Just for knowing that really obvious rule? Anyway, the DM said that the orc wasn't flat-footed. I pointed out that since he had not gone yet that, yes, he was. He overruled me. So, fine, no backstab. I rolled to hit and missed. The entire group, even Player 2 (the brother of my co-worker) laughed at me.

Laughed at me. For rolling bad. 

It got worse from there:

1. Apparently the DM doesn't allow attacks of opportunity. Neat. So there goes all the usefulness of my Combat Reflexes feat. 

2. The DM cast a ""dominate"" spell on me. I was not allowed a save. Not even a roll. Why? Because ""this guy is just too powerful"". Not even with a Nat-20.

3. For the rest of the combat he had my half-elf rogue talk like a valley girl during her turn and flirt with the players 1-3 rather than do, well, anything.

Finally the combat ended and now it was time to officially meet the group. Everyone in the group, all of good alignments (including one LG Paladin!) just mocked my character with bad valley-girl voices. When I replied in my character's normal voice the DM decreed that no, the Dominate spell had made it so I could only speak in that ""accent"" now (e.g. ""Like, totally guys? This is like, soooo super cool!""). Basically he made it so that my rogue, with her 14 Intelligence, was now an air-head.

Fine, fine. Sometimes these things can be fun, right? So I played along. Bad idea.

Next, during a short break, I asked the DM if I could change my Combat Reflexes feat since he didn't allow AOO. He said nope: he doesn't allow ""retraining"".

Back at the table, I try to RP with the group, now in my new ditsy/valley-girl persona. It did not go well at all. The half-orc in the group apparently hates elves and I'm close enough to being a full elf for him to great me like shit. But at least he actually role-played a little: the other players just kept making jokes about the size of my character's breasts (even though when I described her I never said they were large). 

Finally we got to the actual mission for the session. We had to help a local Baron recover his family's ancestral sword, which had been stolen by a group of bugbears led by a ""mysterious figure"". For once, the DM let me do what I wanted: I asked to sense the baron's motives. I rolled a 17 on the die and he immediately said I believed him. Checking my sheet I said, ""With my ranks in Sense Motive that's actually a 25."" He said, ""Too late, you believe him."" At that point Player 1 said, ""I'm going to Sense Motive, too."" He rolled a 13 on his die but with his ranks/bonus got an 18. So the DM took him aside to tell him, basically, that the Baron was hiding something from us.

Frustrated, I continued to play. We had a random encounter with some sort of lizard-thing (forget its name) and this time I couldn't backstab because I'd ""have to be on top of him"" to stab his back and you're not allowed to enter an enemy's square unless you grapple. Fine, fine.

That's when Player 3 began rolling for me. Yep, he just upped and started rolling for me. Granted, I hadn't been rolling very well in combat. But when one of my last turns in that combat came I said I was attacking and he, sitting to my left, grabbed my die and rolled it. Of course, he rolled high and I finally hit. So the group decided that he should roll for me the rest of the session (if not forever).

Eventually we reached an old graveyard that our ranger had tracked the bugbears to. I asked if I could make a Knowledge: Local roll to see if I knew anything about this graveyard (ooc I was thinking *undead*!). Nope, not allowed, even though in my backstory ""local"" to me was this very barony. So yeah, we walked into a graveyard and sure enough? Undead everywhere.

Player 1 went down, but didn't die. Player 2 (the co-worker's brother) went down and SHOULD have died but the DM said that a magical wisp appeared before him just as he was about to die and healed him back to full strength. WTF? 

At this point, with the situation so dire and this group decidedly not cool, I decided to get the fuck away. On my next turn I said I was using withdraw to run the fuck away from the skeleton I was barely hurting anyway (slashing weapon). The DM decreed that my character wouldn't do that. This time I said, ""Yes, she would. She knows a losing battle when she sees it."" He said, ""Give me an Intelligence check, then."" I rolled a 19!!! Best roll of the night. With my +2 INT that made it a 21. DM? ""Nope, you're too stupid to realize you should run.""

So I attack. Miss.

Next turn I'm down to three hitpoints. I try to withdraw again but the DM says I can't. Not even a roll this time, I simply am not allowed to. So as a free action I yell out, ""Uhm, guys?!?! I like, totally think we need to get out of here, ya know!?"" and then I stab at the skeleton again, hit, but do only one point of damage due to damage reduction.

The skeleton fighting me kills me on its next turn. Not unconscious, DEAD. -12 hitpoints. Meanwhile only one player is still up (the one the wisp saved for some random, stupid reason). He decides to bolt. The DM let him.

And that's where the session ended. Everybody dead except for that guy. The DM said to us at the end, ""Don't worry, next session I have a great plan for how you guys actually survived.""

??? I literally stared at him as I packed up my dice and papers and stuff. Then I said, ""There won't be a next time for me.""

""Oooo she's mad,"" somebody said. ""Characters die, hon. Don't get upset about it. It's just a game.""

""Games are supposed to be fun,"" I said in reply. And then I left.

This morning I received a text from my co-worker's brother asking if I was mad. I replied to say, ""Just disappointed. I wanted to play D&D last night. That was not D&D."" He has not responded.

Anyway... that was easily the worst, biggest waste of time I've ever experienced at a gaming table. But *please* feel free to tell me if I'm overreacting for not wanting to EVER game with those guys again. Oh, and also feel free to share your ""worst sessions"" here, too! Finally... thanks for reading if you made it this far! :D

**tl;dr**: New group, no rules, bad experience. Your turn!

**edit** Sneak attack, not backstab!!! It's been a long time since I played a rogue and everyone last night was calling it backstab so it sort of stuck. Also? My rolls are estimates. But I did roll really high in my INT check and on the Sense Motive check. :{",rpg,1417719628.0,0,7487,1420

Sorry.,"I've recently been relistening to *'Til Death Do Us Blart*, a podcast in which the McElroy brothers (also hosts of *The Adventure Zone*) and the hosts of the equally funny *Worst Idea of All Time*, rewatch Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 every American Thanksgiving until they die. As a part of this podcast, they have spun up a lot of insane headcanon for the (frankly pretty bad) movie, including an immortal Paul Blart, one character being an interdimensional ghost trapped in the Wynn Casino, and an evil malevolent force called The Shadow Man.

I am an idiot, so I wrote a microRPG, designed to be played in one sitting, about both Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 and the ""extended universe"" lore created in DeathBlart. It ... might not make any sense if you haven't seen the movie, but also, take this as an opportunity to guess what on Earth the plot of Paul Blart 2 is based on these context clues. It's really dumb and uses a bunch of d12s, so please enjoy [the game in all of its ill-conceived glory](http://mpburdick.com/Blart.pdf).

90,171,o5jvw0,How my therapist prescribed TTRPGs and they healed my soul.,"**TLDR: TTRPGs are more than just games and are extremely therapeutic. You should be proud to be a creator or player, because if it wasn’t for people like you, I would probably be in a far worse place.** 

I was born with a rare liver disease that has symptoms similar to muscular dystrophy. I was never able to keep up with other kids in any physical activity. Through most of elementary school I was bullied for being overweight, slow, etc. and then I found...Advanced D&D (second edition). 

&#x200B;

I dove in and could do what I never could in life, even as simple as run away from a bad guy. There was a sense of catharsis. I found myself loving the idea of creating my own world that valued each person for who they are, not judged them by their weaknesses. 

&#x200B;

I started DMing when I was 8 and was home brewing even back then. Being raised in a strict conservative religious home, I spent most of my youth sneaking out to RPG with my friends. RPGs were my way to process, vent, experience, and create without the judging eyes or limitations. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to when I got married. It was a very emotionally toxic relationship, and she was very controlling. So, she demanded that I give up my gaming. Being the dutiful husband I did. As things got worse in my marriage, I found myself having horrible nightmares where I was hurting people I cared about and it scared me. 

&#x200B;

I ended up seeing a therapist with a binder full of the different archetypes from my dreams and how they manifested in me. (Looking back now I see that I was creating characters). Needless to say, he was overwhelmed and just started talking about what I used to love to do. As we talked about my experiences with TTRPGs, he lit up and grabbed a prescription pad. He prescribed TTRPGs to help me make sense of all the chaos in my real life and keep me grounded.

&#x200B;

I was overjoyed, but had no books, gaming group, or any way to get started. I posted a LFG flyer on my local game store bulletin board (Yes  I am that old), but my mind was racing filled with stories, lands, species, creatures, situations, puzzles, adventures, etc. So, I started creating my own game called Rupture. It wasn't long before I started to gain control of my emotions, value myself, and feel excited for life again. My toxic marriage ended after 11 years, and I have been single for longer than that. 

&#x200B;

There have been times that TTRPGs have been put on the back burner in my life for other ""important"" things, but never for very long. Playing RPGs and creating Rupture allowed me to use my imagination to heal my soul. As I continue to develop the game with my amazing team and community, I can’t be grateful enough to everyone involved because of how meaningful and impactful this has been for me.  

&#x200B;

But beyond my story, I see how by giving people an opportunity to play TTRPGs, we help others reach their subconscious in an instant because they are in the safer realm of imagination. Through imaginative play, TTRPGs are better equipped to empower than most mediums, allowing people to release their demons and pains in a safe experience that heals much faster than trying to find a way past logical walls they have built hoping to protect themselves from hurt in their regular life. 

&#x200B;

I am so grateful for the healing and enlightenment I have gotten from creating and playing rpgs, and if I can give a piece of that to one person so that it touches them in a positive way like it has done for me, then as a creator and player that’s the greatest reward anyone can ask for.

&#x200B;

Believe or not...this is the short version. I am always happy to share more about me if you’re interested. Just ask! :) . 

&#x200B;

I know this was long… so I really appreciate you taking the time to read my story.

92,176,35fpdj,[System] Actual Cannibal Shia Labeouf,"# Actual Cannibal Shia Labeouf

## A Two Page RPG 

*You’re walking in the woods. There’s no one around and your phone is dead. Out of the corner of your eye you spot him…*

***Shia Labeouf***

*He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint! He’s gaining on you!”*

### **Premise**

You are one of the unlucky ones. You have been caught up in a deadly struggle with Shia Labeouf. Band together with other strangers to escape, outwit and possibly even kill Shia Labeouf.


### **Character Creation**

You will need :-

* A name
* A brief description of your character
* An item you have in your possession.

### **How to Play**

Your character can be anyone. Unless the Shia Master (SM) specifically stipulates it during an action, your general fitness and body shape won’t limit you in any particular way. The item in your possession can be virtually anything with the exception of the following:

* A working cellphone or other communication device.
* Large quantities of ammo.
* Items that immediately and completely resolve the situation.
* Paper bags with which to trap Shia Labeouf.

Each character begins play with 5 blood tokens. These represent your wellbeing. As you are attacked and move through various challenges, you will lose blood tokens. When your Shia Master (SM) requires it, roll a D6. If the number is equal or greater than your current number of blood tokens, you lose one, which is discarded into the centre of the table. Once you lose all five, the next attack will be fatal.The only goal is to survive and escape the scenario you are in. Shia Labeouf will hunt you as long as you remain in the vicinity. The item you have can possibly aid you in some way, though your SM will determine how helpful it is in a given situation. 

Actions are taken in the following order - The GM describes the scene -> The players offer their actions -> the GM will give how the environment and Shia respond to them. Once the new situation has been described, the cycle repeats.

Good luck….






## **SM’s Section**

This is a little or no prep one-shot RPG. Character creation takes about 60 seconds. This is a collaborative story-telling game and has no stats and uses only a single die to do every significant action. Descriptiveness is encouraged! It’s unlikely the game will last more than 2 hours.

Shia Labeouf is fast, powerful and possibly naked. Think the bastard son of Jason and Mike Myers with the cruelty of Freddy Krueger and the speed and power of the Wolfman. He hunts mercilessly and will not stop until he has tasted blood and consumed the flesh of his quarry. Gently guide your players by describing the areas they are in. Unless their actions are completely ridiculous, allow them to attempt them. Success is automatic but blood tokens are not unlimited. For game purposes Shia Labeouf has a minimum of 5 +[2x the number of players] in blood tokens, though the number can be adjusted by the SM if they wish to increase the challenge.

If the players attack Shia, either directly or with environmental hazards, remove one of his blood tokens then have him retreat to give the players a brief respite. If the players somehow manage to deplete all of Shia’s tokens, they are victorious but forever scarred by their horrifying experience.  If a player dies as a result of expending all their blood tokens, these discarded tokens are added to Shia’s total as he consumes the body, bones and all! Of course, while he feasts, the players can flee unimpeded. Interrupting his feeding will greatly anger Shia and cause him to target the interrupter more viciously than the others.

Each scenario is an exercise in improvisation for the SM. You are given a setting and expected to run with it in whatever direction Shia chases your players. Think of it as a particularly tongue in cheek horror film. Vivid descriptions are key, whereas maps and miniatures are discouraged. You describe a scene, the players respond and you insert Shia's actions where appropriate. Players roll for actions that may result in harm, physical or mental. This game is not intended to be fair to the players.  People will die. If the players manage to get into a safe situation (locked in a safe room, trapping Shia permanently) you can expend 2 of his blood tokens to cause a **Shia Surprise!** where he escapes the situation, however implausible his escape may be. Do not allow the players a huge amount of time to think or plan. More than five minutes of safety should be interrupted, using a **Shia Surprise!** if necessary. Feel free to play on horror story cliches and make the game as serious or silly as you wish. Silly is kind of inevitable though. 

Some locations  are given below to get you started. Flip a coin for the left or right column then roll a d6 to decide the nightmare that awaits your players!

While I'm confident in two of those areas, I've never taught history before in any capacity, so it's been a grand experiment. Today, however, I gave my students [this paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CrvoSsYJwI_fc-tZN4LhLGEIQ_l8dP3FW6f074grbwU/edit?usp=sharing), and they *loved* it.

94,180,105euuu,"Rant: ""Group looking for a GM!""","Partially inspired by the recent posts on a lack of 5e DMs. 

I saw this recently on a local FB RPG group:

>Looking for a DM who is making a D&D campaign where the players are candy people and the players start at 3rd level. If it's allowed, I'd be playing a Pop Rocks artificer that is the prince of the kingdom but just wants to help his kingdom by advancing technology and setting off on his own instead of being the future king.

That's an extreme example, but nothing makes me laugh quite so much as when a fully formed group of players posts on an LFG forum asking someone to DM for them -- even better if they have something specific picked out. Invariably, it's always 5e.

The obvious question that always comes to mind is: ""why don't you just DM?""

There's a bunch of reasons, but one is that there's just unrealistic player expectations and a passive player culture in 5e. When I read a post like that, it screams ""ENTERTAIN ME!"" The type of group that posts an LFG like that is the type of group that I would never want to GM for. High expectations and low commitment.

96,182,t82gum,"Playing D&D In Ukraine, How And Why We Actually Didn't","Sunday's coming, are we going to meet and play? Yes! Sure! We should do it! Let's gather! Let's have fun!

So we gather. While we're at it, mister president says (presumably, there have been warnings about possible fakes and personally I didn't hear him, but pesumably) that the russian bombers are going to attack the city. Does it bother us? A little, because times are what they are, but we're still gonna play, so let's hit the supermarket and get some snacks and play!

Supermarket number one is part of a popular chain, the goods are significantly cheaper than in other stores, probably that's why there's almost nothing on the shelves. Bread is there, though. Looks like people who were hoarding bread have finally filled their caves and now they lie on huge mounds of bread, dreaming, tiny flickers of fire escaping from their nostrils, filling the air with the delicate smell of French toast.

But we want some snacks, so we go to another supermarket, less cheap but more fulfilling.

""Oh, damn it. Air raid alarm"".

The alarm sound comes from several directions - many people have the app for it installed on their phones. Should we move to the shelter? Probably, but we've come together and we want to play! Besides, it'll probably be over when we get to the apartment!

So we get the snacks, and we get to the apartment, and the alarm is over. Yay! A swig or two of non-alcoholic beer - for the victory, for Putin's coffin, for the victory again.

In two minutes the alarm sounds again.

""Maybe we should go to the shelter"".

""But we just got here!""

""Look, all I'm saying is you probably shouldn't sit next to the window"".

""All I'm saying is we're probably in the safest city in the region"".

""And probably in the safest district in the city"".

""But shouldn't we go to the shelter?""

""Uh, FINE!""

""Maybe we shouldn't?""

""If it calms people down, fine, let's go, let's take a look at it"".

And we're off to see the shelter, the wonderful shelter from bombs. It looks depressing. Also more than a little claustrophobic. I find a chair and declare that I'm not moving from it, while the others are discussing if they should have a quick game of Munchkin. They also check their phones and tell me that a russian fighter had been shot down. The shelter fills  with a triumphant roar.

The alarm is over, then it starts again, then it's over again. I refuse to budge from my chair, but my decision is overruled by the majority. Traitors!

We return to the apartment.

""So take a look, this is list of titles, cool, huh?""

""Mmhm. Oh, yeah, nice"".

""What's that, a primitive name generator?""

""... Yes"".

""Nice, nice"".

""... You can play someone named Satan the Most Unpleasant, isn't that cool?""

""Hey everyone, there's a funny video about international sanctions on Tiktok!""

Everyone takes turns watching the funny video.

""So are we going to play something?""

""I've got the Forbidden Psalm"".

""What's that?""

""It's a wargame"".

""Ugh, wargames. It's all about math and measuring things with a ruler"".

""But there's this cool character generation thing...""

""Do we need a D20? Should I put these dice away?""

""We can use these, no problem, the rules can always be fixed. Look, I know you're a purist...""

""I'm a what?""

""I mean you have read the rules and you remember them for some unknown reason"".

""I know the reason!""

""I don't"".

""Look, last time you tried to use the system but you don't know how many cool things are written in the rules!""

""My point exactly"".

""So are we going to play?""

""Hey guys, they've blocked the transit movement from here to here"".

""Have they, huh? Let's see how we can get to Bulgaria if things get really ugly now... this looks promising, only here's a swamp and here's a bridge...""

""You know what, we can just keep this up, just talking and laughing and whatever"".

""Yeah, well, I thought we would play"".

""Maybe another time. Do you think we'll win by next Sunday?""

""I think the day after tomorrow would be perfect. 8th of March - Victory Day, everyone celebrates"".

""Stalin died in March, didn't he?""

""Sure did"".

""Man, I wish N. was here, he's always so thoughtful"".

""He's deeply prorussian. He's probably going through a cognitive dissonance right now"".

""Hope he can get through it"".

""Hope he can"".

Curfew is drawing closer, so we split the party, some of us stay and some of us leave to feed the cats and catch up with the work and get ready for whatever the future brings.

""I've sometimes wondered if I could kill a human being. Now I'm certain that I can. I'm not sure I wanted to know this about myself"".

""But it's good to know that"".

""It's interesting to know that"".

""Maybe we'll be able to play next time"".

""If things turn out good for us"".

""We'll manage"".

""Sure we will"".

So we didn't play a role-playing game this time. I blame Vladimir Putin for it. But we got together, we talked a good talk and laughed, we inspected the bomb shelter and we're ready, more or less, to keep on working and fighting for the future.

100,190,c4d0a1,Controversial Opinion: Creating your own RPG is pretty easy and everyone should try it.,"One mantra that I hear tossed around here and on /r/RPGdesign is that you shouldn't try to make your own RPG unless you are very experienced and have played a lot of RPGs.

This is nonsense.

While playing a lot of RPGs is very helpful (I love reading how other people have solved difficult design problems) you definitely DON'T need to be some kind of expert to start designing. I run games with 10 year olds every week, and got them started on my game [Maze Rats](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197158/Maze-Rats?affiliate_id=379088). Within weeks, they were coming to me with stories of games that they had played at home, DMing for their parents and siblings.

In almost every case, they had immediately begun hacking the rules. One kid even stapled together his own blank pamphlet and had started writing down the rules he'd come up with. Mr. Milton had done it, so how hard could it be?

Did their rules have problems? Probably, but who cares? After a while they would discover those problems for themselves, figure out how to solve them, and *teach themselves game design in the process*.

The idea that RPG design is some ultra-arcane process whose secrets are reserved for only the most dedicated and obsessed RPG fans is *really dumb*. Your game does not need to do anything original. It does not need to solve a particular problem. It does not need to ""innovate"" or ""push the medium forward"". You and your friend just have to enjoy it, and you have to be willing to change course and make corrections as you go. 5th graders can do it. You can do it too.

In the early days of DnD, the assumption was that DMs were not only creating their own worlds and building their own megadungeons for players to explore, but also that everyone was gradually building up their own custom ruleset that worked for them (it was also kind of inevitable, given how confusing the OD&D rules were). Game Design was inextricably entangled with being a dungeon master. The modern perceived divisions between those roles is not healthy for the hobby, in my opinion. They're just rules! Nothing will happen if you make your own!

So make a heartbreaker! Recreate DnD all over again! Make some experimental monstrosity that breaks every rule of RPGs! Enjoy yourself and learn something in the process. No one can stop you.",rpg,1561327707.0,0,2313,398

I live in a very conservative area, and it's next to impossible to fill a group up with players who align 100% with my politics. Usually that isn't a problem, because fantasy is great escape from real world bullshit including politics, but not this time. 

Two players, both ardent Trump supporters for what it's worth, have taken great issue with the elf being in our fantasy world. They claim that we're forcing our ""BS politics"" down their throat and that only Drow Elves (evil elves that dwell underground, for those of you who aren't familiar) can have dark skin. 

It's gotten as silly as them citing passages from J.R.R. Tolkien where he describes elves as being fair-skinned. It's been distressing, because it's otherwise a fun group of people to game with. But currently this issue threatens to tear the group apart.

111,213,wbw2gx,Driving to Gen Con? Read this.,"Lots of you will be driving cross-country this week to Indianapolis for Gen Con. Unfortunately, you’ll also be driving home - and you’re way more likely to be exhausted. I’m a fatigue & alertness consultant when not designing games, so this seems like a good time to pull out my standard semi-annual advice to keep you alive. Feel free to share.

For people driving (or gaming) on short sleep:

1. Most people need 7-9 hours of sleep to be well-rested. When you're getting less than that (as most people do), you're far more likely to suffer from something called ""microsleeps."" The less sleep you've had, the more likely it is that you'll experience these.

2. Microsleeps are periods when a wave of sleep washes over you, for anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. Often times, you may not even realize that you've been technically asleep; these can happen while your eyes are open. Don't remember the last five minutes of your drive, or your attention is wandering to things that aren't the road? You're suffering from microsleeps. 

3. Microsleeps can happen at any time, but they are MUCH more likely when you're sleep deprived. In a recent documentary, they kept someone up for 24 hours and had them drive around a test track for an hour. He remembers drowsing off twice; in actuality, he fell asleep 22 times, and only remembered 2 of them. This is happening to you, too. If you're sitting at a table, no one cares. If you're behind the wheel of a car, you're screwed.

4. At these times, your reaction time is awful. If you're on a flat straight empty road, you'll hopefully be okay. If the guy in front of you hits his brakes, though, you'll never be able to react in time. It's incredibly dangerous.

5. When you feel this starting to happen, pull the car over off the road, get into the passenger seat, and take a ten minute nap. Walmart parking lots are really good places for this, as they never mind.

6. Cold air, a blasting radio - these provide only momentary (and minuscule) boosts to your alertness. A short ""power nap"" is the only thing that will raise your alertness in the short term. Ten or fifteen minutes of shuteye will help you stay awake for the next 1-2 hours. Caffeine can help too, but isn't a perfect solution. For the greatest effect, take a ""coffee nap"": drink a cup of coffee and close your eyes for ten minutes. You'll wake up incredibly alert. (If you're falling asleep during a game, a 5 minute break with your eyes closed can help, as well.)

7. Remember, sleepiness comes in waves; you may be fine, then 20 minutes later you're ready to keel over. Sleep-related accidents are much more likely to occur with folks who have been up all night, then who drive farther than 20 minutes. The presence of daylight helps a great deal with your alertness, which is why the vast majority of fatigue-related accidents happen between 1am to 6 am, especially right around dawn.

8. Regarding reaction time and the ability to reason logically - studies have shown that after 22 hours without sleep (assuming a morning wake-up time), your performance is equivalent to someone with a .08 blood alcohol level. After 24 hours with no sleep, performance and mental acuity is equivalent to .10 - legally drunk. See, there's a reason you make stupid decisions when tired! And you don't want to know about how you do when you're tired AND drunk. If you're sleep-deprived, keep this in mind when thinking about what you're doing, especially if you have to drive.

9. Short naps (10-15 minutes, 20 minutes max) are great for short-term alertness boosts. Long naps (2-3 hours) are even better; they give you restorative sleep and can keep you going another 6-10 hours. Stay away from 1-hour naps. Due to the way your sleep patterns run, a 1-hour nap will often leave you feeling groggy and tired, when a shorter or longer nap will not. Neat, huh?

10. The amount of alertness you gain after 5 hours of sleep is significantly higher than the amount you gain after 4 hours. If you have a choice, you'll be a lot happier with that extra hour.

11. More than 3 cups of coffee (or doses of caffeine) doesn't make you any more alert; it just makes you more anxious, irritable and prone to stress. Keep your coffee intake spaced out, don't overdo it, and remember that caffeine stays really active in your body for roughly four hours after drinking it. If you try to sleep when caffeinated, your sleep quality will stink; for that reason, try to time your caffeine intake so that you stop drinking caffeine 3-4 hours before your anticipated bedtime.

There a ton more information that may help, but this is a decent fast primer. Be aware of your drowsiness when driving, and watch out for that mental sluggishness - recognizing it in time may be the best thing you do this coming weekend.

The latest Questing Beast video (link above) goes into an interesting issue facing 5e players.

As someone who GMs more often than plays, a lot of what QB brings up here resonates with me.

&#x200B;

My non-5e group, by comparison, is usually more willing to trade roles and balance the effort. This is all very anecdotal of course, but I did find myself nodding along to the video.

There’s a persistent expectation in this hobby that the GM is the one who does everything: not just adjudicating the game, but also hosting and scheduling. In recent years, this has not extended to the GM being the one to go over safety tools, ensure everyone at the table feels as comfortable as possible, regularly check in one-on-one with every player, and also mediate interpersonal disputes.

This is a lot of responsibility for one person. Frankly, it’s too much. I’m not saying that safety tools are bad or that GMs shouldn’t be empathetic or communicative.

115,220,xdk16y,WoTC files injunction against Ernie Gygax's TSR LLC,"*This situation involves hot-button issues, so let's all keeps our replies to each other respectful. Content warning: racism.*

You may remember Ernie Gygax founding his own TSR (a.k.a. ""NuTSR"") a few years back, based on a trademark claim that some found questionable. He then garnered lots of negative attention with tweets that many considered racist, transphobic, hostile, etc. ([story](https://gizmodo.com/tsr-games-distances-itself-from-ernie-g-gygax-jr-the-1847203067))

Well, NuTSR just released the beta of Star Frontiers RPG, which (shockingly) is chock full of racism, transphobia, and more. ([story](https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tsrs-star-frontiers-new-genesis-playtest-contains-racist-content))

The best/worst example is probably the ""Negro sub-race"" who have 30% lower (max) Intelligence than the also-playable ""Nordic sub-race"". Why? Well as the rules explain, ""Races in SFNG are not unlike races in the real world. Some are better at certain things than others, and some races are superior than others."" Yeeeeah. ([more examples here](https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tsrs-star-frontiers-new-genesis-playtest-contains-racist-content))

In response, WoTC has filed an injunction to stop its publication, asserting that NuTSR's use of the ""TSR"" trademark is invalid and tarnishes WoTC by association. ([story](https://www.geekwire.com/2022/wizards-of-the-coast-files-lawsuit-to-stop-publication-of-tabletop-game-alleging-trademark-violation-and-reprehensible-content/))

Whew.

Pretty sure I know what you're thinking, which is, ""Wait, aren't WoTC the ones in trouble for being racist?"" Well, yes, but that was a different story! In short, WoTC's newest Spelljammer book included the ""Hadozee"", a race of monkey-men who were uplifted into intelligence by civilized wizards and born into slavery. Oof. ([story](https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/spelljammer-race-controversy-hadozee))

So their stance may seem hypocritical, but I will at least give WoTC credit that they almost immediately apologized and revised the race's background completely. ([story](https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/spelljammer-hadozee-apology)) Does that absolve them? Heck no, because stuff like this *just keeps happening* with WoTC. However, I'm very glad that they're on the right side in ***this*** specific situation . . . and I think we can all agree that Star Frontier's blatant racism is worse than any slip-up WoTC has made.

\--------

EDIT: Well, I didn't intend for Hadozee discussion to dominate this thread. I was only mentioning it because it'd be really weird (disingenuous, even) to discuss WoTC going after a company for being racist and *not* acknowledging that WoTC has had racism issues themselves. I already said this in my last paragraph, but I guess I'll repeat myself? *WoTC's ""accidentally racist"" content pales in comparison to TSR's blatant, intentional racism.* 

Also, if you don't understand why people got upset about the Hadozee or think ""it's just because they were monkey-men bards"", please click the freaking ([story](https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/spelljammer-race-controversy-hadozee)) link next to that paragraph and actually *read* what the issues are.

Her first combat encounter involved a couple of dog-sized spider creatures (she's terrified of spiders in real life.) She had a short sword, but still asked if her Dragonborn character could ""BITE the spider?"" I was like SHE SURE CAN! She's kicking spiders, stabbing them, throwing them.

124,241,3ysh48,Fail Forward: How Han Solo failed almost every roll except the impossibly difficult ones,"tl;dr Han Solo is sympathetic because he whiffs on so many mundane actions while succeeding on the outlandish ones.
---

I think the concept of *failing forward* is one of the best things to happen to tabletop roleplaying in a long time. In essence, it means that when a player's dice come up as a failure, the character is able to at least somewhat accomplish their proximate goal though they incur a substantial hardship to be dealt with. The concept was explained to me in terms of Han Solo's choice of Lando Calrissian as someone to seek out for safety; technically, Han failed that roll, Bespin was a *bad* place to hide, but it led to a great and interesting story arc. Well, when you look at Han's other (mis)adventures, you see the same pattern, and it reminds me of the Pixar rule: 

   *""You admire a character for trying more than for their successes""*

Here is everything I could think of that would count as a roll for Han Solo through episodes 4, 5, and 6:

**A New Hope**

* Han tries to impress Kenobi with his Kessel Run performance, fails.
* Han tries to negotiate with Greedo, fails.
* Han tries to somehow outdraw the guy with the gun trained on him, succeeds!
* Han tries to spot the moon-sized base, then tries to free his ship from its tractor beam, fails, fails.
* Han tries to go undetected on a small, closed ship the empire knew he was hiding on, succeeds!
* Han tries to bluff his way through an explanation of the blaster fire in the prison block, fails.
* Han tries to stop the garbage compactor, fails.
* Han tries to make a stand against the stormtroopers in the hallway, fails and has to run away.
* Han declares he is coming out of nowhere to rescue Luke from imminent disaster in the middle of a battle, succeeds!
* Han fires on Darth Vader's TIE fighter squadron, fails forward.

* Han fires on imperial scout drone trying to only wound it, critically succeeds, destroying it entirely so no data can be recovered.
* Han decides to go search for Luke when the odds of survival are 725 to 1, succeeds!
* Han attempts a rudimentary jump to hyperspace, fails.
* Han attempts to navigate an asteroid field when the odds of survival are 3,720 to 1, succeeds!
* Han tries to find a safe asteroid to land on, fails forward.
* Han attempts to charm a princess way out his league who said she'd rather kiss a wookiee, succeeds!
* Han tries to fly directly at a Star Destroyer, succeeds!
* Han tries to think of a safe place to hide out at, comes up with Lando Calrissian, fails forward.
* Han fires on Darth Vader, fails utterly.
* Han is captured, tortured and frozen in carbonite, uncertain if any of this requires a roll.


**Return of the Jedi**

* Han, completely blind, tries to locate the source of Jabba's voice, fails.
*  Han, still almost completely blind, fires at a tentacle engaged in close combat with his friend Lando, succeeds!
*  Han accidentally kills Boba Fett
*  Han tries to sneak up on a pair of stormtroopers on Endor, fails.
*  Han tries to warn Chewie about the net trap in the forest, fails.
*  Han tries to hotwire the door controls to the shield generator base, critically fails, activating yet more doors.

And here are the counter-examples, where Han succeeded on a relatively straightforward roll:

[IV] Han, Luke and Chewie successfully get the jump on the imperials in the prison block

[IV] Han is able to destroy the TIE fighters pursuing them

[VI] Han impersonates an imperial At-ST walker pilot to gain access to Endor base

I don't know how you would build a system to intentionally re-create a character like Han Solo who seems to fail at nearly all the small stuff but manages to bank karma for the big important moments, but it seems to me that his constant failure is a big part of his charm and failing forward is so baked in to storytelling that we don't bat an eye when we see it.

125,245,wp2tim,Does it bother you how D&D parties are essentially Monster Squads now?,"This might stink worse for me because I'd rather have Sword and Sorcery/Pulp Fantasy over High Fantasy any day, but I'm genuinely surprised at how most settings (Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk etc) are intended to be humanocentric but people hardly ever play humans. 

Always thought that this was detrimental to the notion of the fantastical. Elves for instance are supposed to be an arrogant fey-people, older than time itself. But the moment you allow your weeaboo friend to play one that mystique is just flushed down the toilet. 

The conclusion I've arrived at is: if everything is fantastic nothing is. 

Lately I've been really reticent on allowing players to play anything other than humans but they always complain that humans are ""boring"". I've found that games that treat race-as-class like B/X and tables for randomly generating your ancestry like Forbidden Lands achieve a nice mix of preserving a majority of humans while still allowing for other races to be present.

However when they do get the opportunity to play one of these races they never really engage with the different cultural and psychological aspects of being an immortal fey/lycanthrope/winged bird person/whatever. They just gravitate towards having dark vision and a couple other racial powers. So what's the point of it in the end?

126,249,ffw1w0,Super proud dad right now,"Yesterday I ran a very short Dungeon World adventure for my six year old son. (My wife too, but mainly she was there to be another player for our son to interact with.) I figured that while the rules would be a bit hard for the boy, Dungeon World's feature of asking the players to fill in details would work well for him.

I couldn't have asked for a better result.

Upon discovering that he could be a healer who could help people, he immediately chose to be a cleric. He wanted to be ""good and kind, and also wear blue and green clothes.""

I started them in the woods at night, (and put appropriate ambiance sounds on a speaker.) They were watching goblins around a camp fire.

Me ""Why are you here? Are you here to rescue someone, or maybe the goblins stole something?""

My kid ""They stole something!""

Me ""What did they steal?""

My kid ""Treasure!!!""

Me ""Who did they steal it from?""

My kid ""ummmmm.... Elves!""

And so began an adventure to get a chest of treasure that the goblins had stolen from the King of the Elves. He loved using his imagination to answer my questions about the story, and I was very interested to discover that he wanted to get the treasure back without actually fighting the goblins. As a human cleric he got a wizard spell and he chose invisibility.

He hid behind our table and whispered to my wife how he wanted to make her invisible to go in and take the chest back. Apparently he was afraid the goblins would hear and see him, so he was being extra careful about hiding. Nothing turned out quite the way he had hoped and he ended up using his fear spell to frighten the goblins one by one. First convincing one that the chest was alive and going to eat him. Then convincing one that his spear was a snake. And lastly making one think his spear was a banana. (It was decided that the last goblin was afraid of healthy food.) There was one more goblin at left at that point, and my wife frightened it away with some fire effects.

10/10 Will run more rpgs with my kid. You should too, they'll surprise you and the smile that they have after the adventure is done will warm your heart. He's already talking about what he happens in the next adventure.

Most of my friends are men and some play rpg's. I'm just salty because a few bad apples make me scared of the clubs and groups and I don't know how to manage it and I have anxiety now when they ask me personal questions or I get attention cause I've been harrassed when turning people down.  
It doesn't matter if it was the first day or months in, I've been asked out in every group I joined the last 10 years and the game dissolved after :(. 


aaaaaaaaaaaa end of formatting reddit on phone is hard
aaaaaaaaaaaa Original Post:. 


Well maybe this a dumb question that I might delete in shame later if the wolves rip me, but here I go. I really want some advice. 
TLDR at the end because there's lots of context and rant here, sorry.

I'm not new to play. I discovered rpgs in uni and joined the club. Played every week and most weekends. Went to some larps, got into cosplay, the whole nine yards. 

People would hit on me but I had a mean girl façade and I'd brush them off. I had a lot of social anxiety but played it cool and it worked? I don't really get social cues and at the time didn't cared to.  


So, uni ended and people went away. I've tried to join some groups in these years (like 7?) but I'm always hitted on. The last 3 groups I joined I clearly explained that I left my last group because the hitting on made me uncomfortable and that I just wanted to play, nothing else. I hate to explain my personal life to strangers but I was trying to assert some boundaries or if I don't then I'm just scared all the time.  

Small Example/Rant: Last group, it was mostly online (bc The Plague) but in the same city. I explain what I am looking for before joining. The DM is new in my city, so I offer to show him around a bit. So we meet in person. The third time meeting, he asks if I am interested in him romantically even if I had asserted that I wasn't interested in dating (he said that) bc I'm nice and we talked for hours (mostly about DnD bc I'm not familiar with 5e). So he thought maybe I liked him and he wanted to shot his shot. Well I was irked but wanting to move on but then I discover that he also put a huge rack on my dragonborn icon (which I never said was female but he assumed). I thought the spot was shining on my character a bit too much the last session and I was so uncomfortable. So I only played one more session before leaving the group (unrelated health reasons).

The group I had before I started giving TMI about my boundaries on the session 0: it was games in a public place and on the second session a player ""caressed"" my knee and another proposed me on a date and I never came back.

Third rant: I've tried to decline when hitted on and move along (all for DnD!) but some ""friends"" threw a fit months later when I started dating someone that wasnt them. Because they accepted my rejection but thought that when I would date again I will chose them as they were ""first in line waiting"". Wtf I am a sandwich in a cafe?  

Am I a coward? Is this my life forever? My male friends have told me that I'm nice and I like to listen/talk so boys are always gonna try, and if I meet them alone they are always gonna think is romantic. But I just prefer to meet people one on one because I'm an introvert. 

I understand people might want to flirt sometimes, but I'm just tired. Of being flirted on, of being touched, of being ignored when I explain I'm not interested. And paranoid. I try to never be alone with a player, sit far away, wear my ugliest baggiest clothes. I'm only playing online even if I have problems with auditory processing so I can't really talk and don't immerse so much. I get uncomfortable when players are nice in case they are flirting but it is always later when I'm relaxed and consider them new friends that the Romantical Discourse  happens.

Any advice? I really miss playing in a table with people. I misss the cliché clickclak of dice. I DMd Paranoia for some friends last week and I had so much fun and I really miss this part of my life.

TLDR: But I don't want to stop being nice. I don't want to have to have all my alerts up it is too tiring. 
Would start session 0 with ""If anyone hits on me I will leave"" instead of ""I left my others groups because people hit on me please don't do that"" work better? Shall I be a bitch? Just endure the flirting and shut it down each time? I don't even know when people are flirting with me but I get cold sweats now if people ask if I have a boyfriend.",rpg,1662521566.0,0,4564,886
128,253,122kr0g,"Design-wise, what *are* spellcasters?","OK, so, I know narratively, a caster is someone who wields magic to do cool stuff, and that makes sense, but mechanically, at least in most of the systems I've looked at (mage excluded), they feel like characters with about 100 different character abilities to pick from at any given time. Functionally, that's all they do right? In 5e or pathfinder for instance, when a caster picks a specific spell, they're really giving  themselves the option to use  that ability x number of times per day right? Like, instead of giving yourself x amount of rage as a barbarian, you effectively get to build your class from the ground up, and  that feels freeing, for sure, but also a little daunting for newbies, as has been often lamented. All of  this to ask, how should I approach implementing casters from a design perspective? Should I just come up with a bunch of dope ideas, assign those to the rest of the character classes, and take the rest and throw them at the casters? or is there a less ""fuck it, here's everything else"" approach to designing abilities and spells for casters?",rpg,1679834122.0,0,1079,191
129,255,tk8tub,"Make your character complex, realistic, and three dimensional, simply by writing down two things that they want (the ""Game of Thrones"" method of character creation)","Hey friends, I just wanted to share what I find to be a really quick, easy, and effective way to create really complex-seeming characters, without the need for detailed backstories or extensive planning between sessions.

I’m going to use ASOIAF (Game of Thrones) characters as an example here, because GRRM essentially used these principals when creating his characters. And in doing so, he threw dozens of believable, understandable, and complex characters at his audience all at once, in a way that even casual readers found engaging.

So, what do you do? Simple really:

**Just pick two things for your character to want.**

That's basically it. Any two things. Justify it with a backstory if you want, but it's not necessary. And these don't have to be specific things; in fact, it's best if at least one or both of them are general.

* Ned (1) wants to preserve law and honor, and (2) will do anything to protect children from suffering
* Dany (1) wants to maximize her personal freedom, and (2) free others from whatever is controlling their lives
* Jamie (1) wants to protect his romantic relationship from anything that threatens it, and (2) find someone who truly understands him

The benefit of this is simple. Whenever your character is in a situation, just ask yourself: what can my character do to advance either, or both, of their goals? What can Ned do in this situation to be an honourable person? What can Ned do in this situation that would protect children from suffering?

I think it's clear now why ""more general"" = ""easier"". Ned’s desires could apply to almost any situation, whereas Jamie’s desires are going to come up more situationally (or, at least, you need to do some extra legwork to make it apply; for example Jamie’s “find someone who understands me” often turns to “I hate anyone who doesn’t understand me”)

You also might notice that your character doesn't have to be conscious of these goals. Subconscious drivers work just as well as conscious ones; sometimes even better. Jamie didn't really know he was looking for someone to understand him, until he found one.

So that helps you on the day-to-day running of your character. But what about those big moments of drama?

**Easy Drama: Simply Shake-N-Bake**  

In order to create moments of high-tension and inner conflict, all you have to do is find your character in a situation where their two wants becomes mutually exclusive.

* Children will die unless Ned does something dishonourable & illegal. Is upholding his principles worth the death of an innocent child?
* The people Dany freed are now using their freedom to oppose her. Will she compromise her personal values to ensure their freedom, or do they now become her enemies in her fight to free herself?

And, again... that's it. That choice, and how your character reacts to it, can easily be a defining & memorable moment of your campaign (or, perhaps, an arc of the campaign).

I'd recommend sharing your two goals with your DM, so they can help engineer these situations for you. Heck, share it with your fellow PCs too, why not? Why keep your character a secret, only to be enjoyed by yourself?

**Character Growth**

What if you want to take it a step further? You want your character to have defined growth throughout their story. Well, that's easy too... just have one of those wants change, as a reaction to something that happens in your campaign.

This could easily be as the result of the dramatic moments I laid out above. For example, Dany decides that the only way she can be truly free is force her will on others. She will no longer care about freeing others, only bringing them under her rule.

However, it doesn't have to be. Something else could happen to make your character re-examine their core desires. What if Ned realized that the laws & honour he upholds so dearly were created by a ruler, a God, or system that is, itself, dishonourable? What if he decided that upholding ""law & honour"" are no longer desirable aims? He could easily abandon this want, for reasons that have nothing to do with protecting children.

In these cases, you basically have two options:

* Replace one of the core desires with a new desire
* Remove one of the core desires, leaving your character to become hyper-focused on the other desire

The first option can be immediate. Our (now-hypothetical) Ned has realized that his laws were created by an unjust King/God/System, and so now instead of “I must follow the law”, his new goal is still “I must tear down the law”. However his other goal, “I must protect children”, remains unchanged.

The second option may lead your character on a downward spiral. A character who only wants one thing can be obsessive and unyielding, because there is nothing to temper or balance their desire. They are now single minded.

This could spell the end of your character. Having decided her personal freedom is paramount, Dany goes on a conquest, trying to bring everyone under her rule, until she is eventually killed.

However, it could also just mean a period of wandering and discovery. Maybe after a few sessions, Dany hears legends of her ancestors. Now she has a new goal “find and preserve the history of my ancestors”, which did not come up as a direct consequence of losing one of her old goals, but still fills that missing hole in her life.

This last section is the most difficult to give specific examples for, because it comes down to reacting. You have to decide that something your character experienced was drastic enough, traumatic enough, or victorious enough, for them to abandon their goals (or consider them permanently accomplished) and move on.

**Why not Three Desires?**

Two is not a hard-and-fast rule. Three desires can work. However, keep in mind that the more desires you have, the more muddled they will become, and the less dramatic it will be when your desires come into conflict with each other. If you have eight ""core desires"", they are going to be coming into conflict with each other every day.

These are also ""core desires"". Your character can have other goals, especially the ""party's goals"". Save the village. Find the treasure. Slay the dragon. However, your personal core desires will shape how you go about achieving the ""party's goals"". Ned wouldn't kill a child to save the village, but Dany or Jamie might.

Finally, keep in mind that you are one of several ""main characters"" in the story. Don't be afraid to let your fellow player's characters have turns in the spotlight. If your character has a limited number of clear ""core desires"", they may not shine through in every situation. But when they do shine through, everyone at your table is going to understand how meaningful the choices you are making are for your character.

**Conclusion**

The key to good roleplaying is not “doing a voice” or “always speaking in character”. Those things can make your roleplaying experience entertaining, but they aren’t necessary for good roleplaying.

What is necessary for good roleplaying is knowing “how would my character act?” Is your character brave in combat, or not? Are they the face of the party, or not? Do they trust strangers who give them quests in taverns, or not?

Sometimes players will bend themselves into pretzels writing 10-page backstories for their characters, laying out epic quests their characters will go on... but still not know anything about who their character is as a person. You just end up playing as yourself on that quest (which is fine, if that’s what you want to do).  
 

On the other hand, if you are able to tell yourself “my character wants X”, it becomes really easy to create a consistent, realistic character, without any further planning. Because all you have to do from there is react to the situations your character is put into, through the lens of your character’s desires.

Choosing two things your character wants will go one step further in making your character three dimensional, and giving you some ready-made inner conflict when you reach a point where those two things become mutually exclusive.

And all you need to do to have good “character development” is transition your characters wants into new wants. Again, no planning needed. Just act and react to the story you and your group are telling.",rpg,1647971727.0,0,8290,1419
130,256,xf4qjx,Something really special is happening with Cyberpunk (2077/Red/Edgerunners),"Just started a campaign and convinced my friends to play Cyberpunk Red with me. There was some interest after a few of them played the video game recently in it's much improved state. They loved the world building and lore, the main and side stories, and the characters. I started reading the rule book and looking up the lore and began to get lost in this incredibly detailed world. The corporations, the people behind them, the wars, the gangs, all the philosophical implications of cybernetics and transhumanism, capitalism, etc. I was falling in love with this world and began building a campaign.

We created characters together and it was an amazingly fun time. The character creation is phenomenal and really ties the player characters to the immediate world and shapes the events and the campaign. By the end of character creation my players and I could actually envision each others characters in a way that was pretty new to us. We learned how they grew up, what the conditions were like, if they had friends/lovers/enemies and if so what's the deal with them (as the GM this is so fun.) We learned what they did for work and how they are connected to Night City.

Then during the next week as the players all chose their skills and cyberware and gear we all watched the anime Cyberpunk Edgerunners. It is brilliant. The animation is as good as it gets, the music from the game, the story and characters and of course Night City. That was something special and put everyone in a very enthusiastic state. Then we finally got to playing.

I had the characters go to a concert as extra security to escort the pop star after the show. They showed up during the last song and I played a song from the Game/Anime soundtrack. I described how the strobe lights matched the beat of the song and how the lasers made little hearts on everyone in between the regular strobe. The song was so wonderful (I Really Want to Stay at Your House) and this scene just became real for all of us. Like the shared storytelling, theatre of the mind experience we were having was much more real than anything I've played before. Some of us got emotional because of how we were transported to a different world. Their characters were transfixed on the performance and they described how they swayed to the music with the crowd.

The rest of the session was amazing. The combat went really quick and they saved the pop star who did some cool stuff during the fight. The players and their characters are obsessed with her now which is a really fun thing.

I just want to add this. Because of the nature of the Cyberpunk universe, because of how close it is to the real world and the dark future we are all sort of quietly fearing in the back of our minds, and because of the quality of the world building and the game/anime being available to get lost in, we were really able to get transported into the world of the game. We could really see each other in character, and understood our characters deeper and because of their immediate and strong ties to the world, the world itself became real. I haven't felt this kind of enthusiasm for a ttrpg campaign since I convinced my favorite coworkers and friends to play DND 5E with me when it came out.

134,267,z02n7s,A two-year perspective on a full-time game designer career," About two years ago, I came to this very sub to announce that I had left my job and decided to pursue a career as a TTRPG designer.

Now with 20 games under my belt, some accomplishments and a lot of mistakes, I come back to offer some perspective on this choice. Perhaps it will be useful for those seeking a similar path.

So, for the sake of transparency, let's kick things off by addressing the elephant in the room, which is...

# Money

Under my original post, someone commented that I'd be making more money slinging hot dogs than making indie games.

They were right.

Despite achieving moderate success on some of my titles, I still struggle to make ends meet.

I don't have a precise number (due to the different policies of the platforms I publish on), but my earnings stay around $10k/year, which I believe is officially below the poverty line.

I have a very frugal lifestyle. I don't own stuff, I live in a 320 sq ft (30m²) studio apartment in a place with a low cost of living. Yet, I'd need to double my income to be in a comfortable situation.

It goes without saying, but let's reinforce it: many designers have had way more (and also less, if I'm being fair) success than I did during the same period of time, even doing this part-time, so take that as you will. I can't pinpoint exactly why my results are what they are, but I can go over some....

# Mistakes and limitations

When I first started, I decided to create a patron-like model for my creations, promising one new game (or a related piece of content) every other week. Someone pointed out in the comments that I'd need to be very prolific, and even then, I'd be running the risk of having my releases competing against each other.

They were also right.

I was putting out full-fledged games twice a month, and without an audience to consume them, they just ran over each other. I was having way better success with my games on itch than with the patron-like format. It was actually not on Patreon, but on Buy me a coffee (whose platform I liked better, but might be one of the reasons for its failure), and I amassed an underwhelming amount of 7 supporters for the few months I had it open.

So I announced I was shutting down the membership program and decided to focus on releasing and promoting my games on itch. That was my first good decision in months. Until I ran into a few limitations of the format, which I will enumerate:

1. **I don't have access to Kickstarter.** It surprises me how many people don't know that, but if you are not from a [handful of countries](https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005128594-Who-can-use-Kickstarter), KS does not allow you to create projects on their platform. And that’s a huge limitation; the discoverability of your project drastically decreases if you’re not able to have your games in front of a lot of people that had never heard of you before. There are more accessible KS competitors out there, sure, but they have a tiny fraction of the organic audience KS has. I wrote about the barriers that creators from the Global South face, and that even ended up being a [Dicebreaker article](https://www.dicebreaker.com/companies/kickstarter/news/tabletop-games-global-south-invisible). 
2. **I don’t sell physical books.** See above. Not being from the US/UK (\~80% of my customers), it is nearly impossible to sell physical books. Shipping costs would be prohibitive. Distribution would be chaotic. This also means I’m not in any brick and mortar FLGS, and that I don’t attend cons, don’t shake hands and network with other people in the industry. We’re pretty much on our own. I could try to partner up with publishers and distributors in the US, but…
3. **I run a one-man show.** Some might say that is a self-imposed limitation, and they wouldn’t be wrong. I create, write, revise, layout,  illustrate and publish all my games, and *I like it that way* and that’s where I want to spend my energy on*.*  One of the reasons I left my job was to be able to have control over my hours, my intentions and my creations, so all the minutiae that go with contracts, partnerships, commissions, counting on other people’s work just bring me too much anxiety. I turned 40 years old last week, and I’ve learned the hard way to recognize my boundaries and preferences, and I’m not ready to give up on that just yet. Which brings me to…
4. **My games are very niche.** I don’t mean it in a highbrow, no-one-understands-my-art sort of way. No, it’s just a recognition that I don’t produce content for the Dragon Game or for its many clones and variants, which alienates 85% of the market. I like to make my own quirky games, which also means I don’t normally do freelance work for other people’s games. *(side note: I think it says a lot about the industry that one can make more money writing/editing/illustrating for other people’s games than by making their own. Creators inject more money in their games than they get out of them).* I know there’s an audience for all kinds of weird stuff, but how does one get their games in front of them? That leads us to…

# Marketing

When I first started, I thought promoting my creations would be half of my job.

I was wrong. It is 90% of my job.

There are 3,000 games being released every year on itch alone, and it doesn’t matter how good, innovative, fun, ridiculously gorgeous your product is, if people don’t find out it exists, you won’t sell.

This is the area most indie creators struggle with, because there’s no budget for paid advertisement, and most platforms are very averse to self-promoting. Most of us rely (relied?) on Twitter, since it’s more forgiving in that regard, even though we are constantly self-conscious about being annoying, and spamming BUY MY GAMES, I BEG YOU! all the time. And there’s also the feeling that most people that follow and support you are other indie designers, so there’s this weird sensation we are in a bubble passing the same $5 around. 

I don’t mean it in a strictly negative way; the support and enthusiasm of your peers is an excellent source of motivation, and I met fascinating creators and creations this way. But what you need when you’re selling your game is to get in front of people that you **don’t know.** 

Marketing is exhausting and frustrating. You don’t get to be solely a game designer. You have to be a “content creator” to entertain and engage. You have to hold your releases until you have built enough “hype”. You can’t have a bad day, otherwise the algorithm swallows you and suddenly you are irrelevant. 

This is just my personal experience, I’m sure other people navigate this much better than I do. For my latest release, I created a press kit and mailed it to some news outlets, with moderate success. It still didn’t solve my problem, and the sensation that I’d capped out my reach lingers on. There’s always this nagging feeling that I’m not doing enough, I’m not connecting with the right people, I’m not active on the right Discord server, I should experiment with other platforms, I should go to TikTok, I should walk into the ocean… 

I know this all seem very gloomy, but it’s not all that bad. I’m generally a very positive person, I’m just revisiting my experiences and taking the opportunity to get some stuff off my chest. So to end in a positive note, let’s talk about…

# Fulfillment 

One of the main concerns I had before deciding to become a full-time game designer is that I would “taint” my relationship with RPGs and I would start hating them. *“Work with what you love, and you’ll never love anything again in your life”*, you know? 

I was wrong (see a trend there?).

I love what I do. Waking up and working with games is as rewarding as I thought it could be. I look forward to starting my work day. The ideas keep coming, and I have two dozen games already on the backburner. If I knew what I’d face these two years the day I decided to quit my job, I’d still do it again. Not a doubt.

I’ve been welcomed into the space with warmth and respect, I have released games in more than 7 languages, I’ve won an award, I’ve won a competition, I have an RPG system with more than 60 games made by the community. I’ve been invited to a number of podcasts (some of them I’d been a long time listener), I have been featured in a number of articles. I have been nominated “one of 10 indie designers to keep an eye on” by a respectable media outlet. I have received enormous amounts of positive feedback, and more than one person I met told me that I am their favorite game designer.

There are good days and bad days. There’s not a week that goes by without my considering looking for a job and quitting this unpredictable life. There are days that I lack the energy to even look at my projects. But I reckon such is the life of anyone that decides to work with creativity. And I can't help but think it is, still, a very rewarding one.

A few months ago, I shared my thoughts on the subject on Twitter and announced I was going to give this career a final go. I started a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/capacle), and this time, with the lessons learned from my previous failure, I simplified it a lot. The response was… overwhelmingly positive. I now fluctuate around 90 patron any given month, and although I’m far from my goal, it is encouraging to feel the support of so many people that believe in what you do.

I gave myself until the end of this year to sort things out. If I’m unable to make this career a sustainable one, it will be time for me to find something else. Or a new strategy, who knows.

# Takeaways

If you made it this far through my rambling and grumbling, and is considering pursuing a career in game design, I’d say (maybe surprisingly), go for it.

My father died of cancer when he was 60, not accomplishing many of his plans that he left for his retirement that never came.

Ultimately, I decided to try it because I didn’t want to be in my death bed, considering “What if I had pursued my passion”. If it all goes wrong, at least I tried. And had fun while doing it. No regrets. 

Be prepared for some hardship, but stay true to who you are. Don’t try and make the game that you think you sell most; make the ones you believe in, the ones that you are excited about. If you think there’s enough games out there, you’re wrong. Every honest game that is published reflects a vision that is unique, it is a slice of a perspective over this incomparable experience that a roleplaying game is. 

Create a good network from the get-go, and always be kind. You might reach more people if you are controversial, but why would you?

And remember (as I always try to do) that nothing is permanent. If it doesn’t work, that is ok. Move on. Try something else. No one is keeping score, you don’t own anyone explanations. 

I’ll be more than happy to answer any questions you might have (from my very limited, very unique perspective), so go ahead and AMA, I guess?

141,277,l6t9zy,An incredibly good actual play that isn't getting NEARLY enough attention.,"Hi guys,

I've recently started watching an actual play series on YouTube called ""Me, Myself and Die"". It's hosted by Trevor Devall  (voice of Rocket Raccoon \[Guardians of the Galaxy animated series\], Emperor Palpatine \[Lego Star Wars\], various characters from F is for Family and a whole load of anime stuff).

What makes it different from other actual plays is, first of all; Trevor is an excellent voice actor and uses music, multiple camera angles and improv talents to bring his stories to life. The production values are top notch. And secondly, he plays no-GM RPGs - which I think is a very interesting sub-genre of TTRPGs that is yet to be fully explored. In the latest season, he is playing Ironsworn, which I know a few of you around here are familiar with. In my opinion, it is the best GMless system around at the moment and Trevor really captures the tone and setting of the Ironlands perfectly.

What is a *real* travesty is the fact that he only has around 5k subscribers at the time of writing. I think the only problem with the channel is a lack of exposure. Anyone who has watched this series will agree this could be (will be?) a huge success. So please, for your own sake if nothing else, go check it out!

Below is a link to the first episode of the 2nd season. You don't need to have watched the first season to get into it (but by all means, go back and watch it) . I think he really found his stride in the current season. Plus, it's the first season that he's playing Ironsworn which is a very good system and setting for what he's doing.

Enjoy!

142,285,cyq2ny,The time I let my character of nearly 1300 playing hours die for the story.,"The best characters are the ones we love, but play true to the story and character we've created. Sometimes a character's personality and justified actions leads them to death's door... And, while it's sad, it's only proper that they ended up there because it was the ending they deserved. 

I will tell my story of such a character, I would love to hear yours.

Years back in my D&D 3.5 days, when it was still a new system, I played in a campaign for 2 years. Average 12 hour sessions, every Saturday, never once missed a game in the entire campaign run. Started at level one, my character died at level 16 and it was a houseruled slow experience progression. It was a strict one life campaign... no resurrections outside of what can strictly be achieved in direct gameplay.

I played Anthony Marcs, a fighter for hire, soldier in the King's Army, and eventually Knight of the Crown. He was known as the One Man Army. A Mountain of a man standing just shy of 7 feet of rippling muscle (who eventually discovered that there was giant blood in his lineage) He fought with great sword and tower shield. 

His story started humbly enough, he was a young man who was just too large not to use his fighting prowess for coin. He mostly worked as a caravan guard or tavern bouncer. When the kingdom went to war, he joined up immediately for the king's coin. But it was never the coin that drove Anthony, that was only a means to fund digging into his family's past. However, he always fought with honor and for his comrades in arms more than anything. 

His journey took him through a war, which the kingdom eventually won. He was swiftly promoted to a battalion captain in the early days. But it was when he saved the general from an ambush that his superiors really took notice. It wasn't long after he was knighted for many brave actions. 

It was then that he became known as the One Man Army. Leading his battalion into the worst of the front lines. Wading into a torrent of death and torment and laying waste to his enemies in large swaths. (I think it was a feat, Improved Great Cleave or something like it that allowed for a 5-foot step to continue cleaving... sooooo broken and exploitable and **boy** did I exploit it.)

During leave from the war, and after the war, he had set out to dig up information about his family's mysterious past. Discovered hereditary magic armor, sword, and shield. Found out his great grandfather was a great knight as well. 

After the War his king sent him on quests for the crown. One such quest was to escort an ambassador to the dwarven nation (they haaated humans). On this mission he managed to befriend the dwarf assigned to work with his party. They liked that he could drink like them and fight like them. 

His final battle came on that mission. As part of the peace treaty the party agreed to help the dwarves with a beast in the depths of their city. Some sort of giant earth lovecraftian plant horror. Whipping tentacles with 60ft reach. The battle was grim, and the party far outmatched. Eventually the Wizard was down, the Cleric out of juice, and most of the combatants impotently forced to stay out of reach of the monster. 

The moment of truth came. Anthony's sword was within the killing field, dropped when saving the wizard from true death. The next in line to be attacked was a Dwarf Warrior (NPC). They had fought side by side on a few quests. He was gruff and unlikeable. But he was down and imobile... Anthony himself wasn't far from death's door...

In a brave action he sprinted into the killing field, managed to grab up his sword on the run (dex check) and make it to the Dwarf Warrior. (First round) He hoisted the unconscious dwarf to his shoulders, both wearing plate mail. 

He ran. 

Mear feet from safety the Monster took notice and attacked. Anthony saw the whipping vine coming, and in desperation he tossed the dwarf (heh) to safety... and took the killing blow that cut him in half. 

The battle was won only very nearly. The Dwarf Warrior survived. They honored Anthony's sacrifice with a monument on the battlegrounds of his death. His loss forged a strong alliance between the nations. 

-----

My DM came to me after the session and asked me if I wanted to bring Anthony back. The battle was so epic, and it was a character I had ran for yeeears. I was the ONLY character that had survived from level 1. But... I couldn't allow it. Sure I loved the character. I was sad to lose him... But, how could I deny such him such an honorable and epic death?

She started recognizing stuff in the rough sketch, so I wanted to see if this could work. I showed her a path that went in two directions and asked her which way she wanted to go. She had a clear opinion on where to go, so the adventure took off!

I flipped the page over, and quickly sketched the path leading to a dark cave, describing everything as I draw it, in words that she knows. There's something next to the cave. ""Do you go in, or check out the other thing?"" The Kid checks out the other thing, which turns out to be a very friendly bear next to a lake! 

I show her the lake and the bear. The Kid starts to whisper. ""...bear...."", and I ask her if she wants to go for a swim or play with the bear. The Kid wants to swim. Splash! I draw a big water splash and The Kid wants the bear to jump in too. Splash! The page is covered in big water explosions. The Kid is excited, shouting to her mum to come and see. 

""Ok, the bear feels wet and goes inside."" I draw pawprints leading into the cave. The Kid wants to follow. Inside, she finds the bear, eyes closed, The Kid's mum makes snoring sounds. ""Do you want to take a nap with your bear friend or go home?"" The Kid goes home. I slowly move the picture back, making it smaller and smaller as we wave and say ""bye bear!""

I tell The Kid that she is now back home. I hug her and ask her what she did. She says it was a bit scary, but quickly begins to talk about bear, splash, making snoring sounds, and other stuff that happened on her adventure.

May it be the first adventure of many. #ProudDad",rpg,1593443872.0,0,1792,354
155,306,113p938,Safety tools: why has an optional rule caused such backlash among gamers?,"Following on various recent posts about safety tools, I find the amount of backlash remarkable and, on the surface, nonsensical. That half-page, sidebar-length suggestion has become such a divisive issue. And this despite the fact that safety tools are the equivalent of an optional rule. No designer is trying to, or can, force safety tools at your table. No game system that I know of hinges mechanically on you using them. And if you ever did want to play at a table that insisted on having them, you can always find another. Although I've never read actual accounts of safety tools ruining people's fun. Arguments against them always seem to take abstract or hypothetical forms, made by people who haven't ever had them at their table.

Which is completely fine. I mainly run horror RPGs these days. A few years back I ran *Apocalypse World* with sex moves and Battle Babes relishing the thrill of throwing off their clothes in combat. We've never had recourse to use safety tools, and it's worked out fine for us. But why would I have an issue about other people using it at their tables? Why would I want to impinge on what they consider important in facilitating their fun? And why would I take it as a person offence to how I like to run things?

I suspect (and here I guess I throw my hat into the divisive circle) the answer has something to do with fear and paranoia, a conservative reaction by some people who feel threatened by what they perceive as a changing climate in the hobby. Consider: in a comment to a recent post one person even equated safety tools with censorship, ranting about how they refused to be censored at their table. Brah, no Internet stranger is arriving at your gaming night and forcing you to do anything you don't want to do. But there seems to be this perception that strangers in subreddits you'll never meet, maybe even game designers, want to control they way you're having fun.

Perhaps I'd have more sympathy for this position if stories of safety tools ruining sessions were a thing. But the reality is there are so many *other* ways a session can be ruined, both by players and game designers. I don't foresee safety tools joining their ranks anytime soon.

But the latest episode, the dungeon master, has some of the best advice I have seen for running a game.

After 7 minutes of explaining who and what a DM is, Jocrap sets up the most ambitious crossover in history. Starting [here](https://youtu.be/ANdG2DGm0CQ) a serious of dnd *things* happens. Stuff we have all seen like questionable homebrew, out of scale backstories, silly multiclasses, questionable mechanical interpretations, etc etc etc. Which as gets brought up here often, are things that frustrate gms the world over.

This comes to the head as it might for any gm. Which is when at [16:20](https://youtu.be/ANdG2DGm0CQ?t=984) he gets the advice to just talk to the players. However this is quickly shot down because he is angry and emotional.

At [17:20](https://youtu.be/ANdG2DGm0CQ?t=1038) he gets introspective and the the artist talks to the character. Bringing that self reflection that we all need on occasion. He then starts asking the questions Gm's often fear. If they don't like the session, things get imbalanced, etc, and that we should keep trying. 

We all have the context to the situation in question. Rather than just a big ole ""talk to your players"", something we all suggest that people do, we get to see the example play out.

158,310,9tg78t,GM Advice: Learn from Kids TV Shows,"Last night while watching PJ Masks with my 4 year old I thought of a theory I'd like to share. I think that most GMs could learn a great deal from writing adventures like kids TV shows. It's a working theory, but it has three parts to it.

1) The stakes are clear and important, but not life or death.

The PJ Masks, Mystery Inc or My Little Ponies are not going to get violently dismembered on screen. That is not the crux of the drama or action. Death is not the penalty for them failing. The stakes of the conflict are so clear that even 3yr olds understand them. If the heroes fail, then X happens. X does not involve death generally. 

From an RPG perspective, this solves two major problems. Firstly, it lets the heroes lose. Losing adds drama and adds consequence to their actions or failures. Too often RPGs are a game of playing through how the PCs win, not IF they win. A villain succeeding in a plan, the heroes being defeated and the terrible X happening are great ways to move the story forward.

The second pro of this is that failure does not disrupt the story via death. A failure adds to the story, generally death detracts from it. Also, if death is the only consequence, players tend to think their characters have plot armour and cannot fail. That is largely a gaming group dependant issue though.

Lastly it makes the GM think about more interesting options for the villains plans and encounters. Something as simple as an encounter with 6 orcs can be made better by just considering what else other than life and death could be at stake. What are the orcs doing? Destroying a damn that will flood the smurf village? Summoning something? Raiding a caravan of nuns? Playing hide and seek? (I actually used that last one in a very funny encounter with 4 ogres and an under-levelled party)

2) Action does not equal violence.

Heroes in kids shows are often using their weapons and abilities to fix problems in action sequences that are not all about violence. I have become a big fan of running in-initiative action sequences that are not all about combat. 

Most recently we had a ship in a storm being called onto rocks by sirens with sharks in the water. The action was about cutting ropes that were tangled, steering the ship, wrestling the helmsmen away as he tries to steer into the rocks, saving sailors who jumped overboard and are swimming to the sirens, putting out fires from badly stowed lanterns etc. Attacking the sirens without dealing with the other issues would have been disastrous.

My second example was in a Star Wars game, they come out of warp suddenly to find an asteroid field. Now we effectively have a combat scene, trying to use missiles to blast asteroids that the pilot cannot avoid. Doing repairs on the ships. Saving people trapped in depressurised areas of the ship. The droid going into space to fix the hull. The slicer trying to boost the computer so it can navigate a warp jump the second they are clear of debris, the caged Nexu they just captured getting free in the cargo hold (which happens to hold the kit they need to repair the ship).

My games have become a lot more action intensive since adopting this style of encounter design. Roughly a third of my action scenes are fairly straight fights. A third are chases or action scenes where there is a fight, but the object is not to kill the baddies e.g. stop the bad guys taking off in the ship, plant these bombs then run, stop the ritual summoning. The last third of encounters are just disasters, things going wrong that require action scenes to fix e.g. Saving orphans from a burning building, shipwrecks, turn on the space stations thrusters and inertial dampeners as it hurtles towards the planet etc.


3) Look at a kid watching Scooby Doo. They feel so clever for working out that Old Man Whithers was really behind it. We don't look at kids and tell them that is stupidly easy and it is bad wrong fun. The point of Scooby Doo is to make the kids feel clever for working out the mystery, not to show off how clever the writer is. Sure the plot could have been more convoluted and clever, Agatha Christie could write a very different Scooby Doo, but would anybody enjoy it more?
The point of a mystery is to not to be clever. It is to make the players think that they were clever for working it out. I save myself a lot of time and effort by remembering this. A rule of thumb for my players is, I set mysteries as one step harder than 'patronising' 

--

None of this is news to veteran GMs, but I found by tying these reflections to kids TV shows, it helps me remember them when designing games. I hope that this is of some use as a reminder to veterans or some helpful ideas to newbies. What do you think? Have you found any rules of thumb that you feel make you a better GM?

160,312,xl7pjw,"A (maybe?) controversial opinion: I like the fact that D&D is a game first and foremost, as opposed to a narrative engine.","I was inspired to make this post because of something Brennan Lee Mulligan says in this short: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/NCgeYOpf5hU

He talks about introducing an epic villain that his party swiftly dispatches a session later. He says that it was ""narratively unsatisfying"" but his PCs loved it. I think that's something that I personally enjoy about D&D -- the fact that on a fundamental level, D&D's mechanics don't center narrative structure or payoffs. I know that a lot of people are frustrated by moments where the game subverts their narrative expectations (e.g. when a player says something badass and then rolls a 1 on their attack or skill roll) but I think I love that aspect of the game, because it leads to outcomes that I often would not have entertained if I were aiming for some specific plot outcome. I like the vein of goofy antics it enables in even the most serious games, and I like how it mirrors life, which is so often untidy and will mingle the risible with the dramatic.

163,318,v5gzsb,"Playing D&D In Ukraine: It's Been 100 Days (and 8 Years), Innit","Hi there.

So, after several weeks of depression, nervous breakdowns, supporting the military, avoiding social contacts and other fun things, I went back to meeting with out local gaming group.

It felt different in many ways.

Last time, the air raid alert meant that we dropped the game, gathered our stuff and moved to the shelter. Today, it was more like:

""Oh, another alert? When did the previous one end?""

""Y'know, these days, I'm only hiding when I hear the bangs"".

""When I hear the bangs, I know that these are the ones that didn't hit me"".

""True"".

Our region used to be significantly russian-speaking, and so were our games. It just doesn't feel nice to speak and hear that language anymore. Today we played in Ukrainian.

Last time, everyone was monitoring the news all the time. Not today. We're used to what's happening, we pretty much know how things go, we're not expecting anything big to suddenly change everything. This is war, it's part of our lives, it's not going away anytime soon.

Which, by the way, means we spent more time actually concentrating on the game.

As usually, we started with deciding who's gonna be the GM today.

""So who's doing it?""

""He is!""

""HE is!""

""Nuh uh, I haven't got any books with me! I haven't prepared anything! I haven't been preparing anything for weeks!""

""Here, you can sit in the nice chair if you're the GM"".

""Hmm. It is a very nice chair, indeed"".

""You're the GM"".

""Ugh, fine. We can do the Immortal  Zoo again"".

""Yeah, Zoo is fun!""

Luckily, I can GM a party through the Immortal Zoo of Ping Feng with my eyes closed.

This party consisted of an undead elf mage, a fairy barbarian with hysteric deafness, a dwarf, a talking beaver, and a Vornheim goblin (the elf's and the barbarian's players have played through the Immortal Zoo before, cudos for staying in character and not metagaming too much, other than roaring with laughter occasionally).

""Where do we meet? Are we in cages?""

""Are we on a slaveship?""

""No, no. Nothing so boring. You meet in a tavern"".

""A tavern, huh?""

""Each one of you got a letter from the Archbishop of Vorn, inviting you here. As you enter the tavern, you notice several people sitting and drinking. They watch you silently. It is completely quiet"".

I don't remember who gave the advice about the completely silent tavern in this subreddit, but I want to thank that person, because it worked well.

Fast forward to the Archbishop arriving, the barbarian drinking beer out of a large bucket with an umbrella in it, and the dwarf feasting on smoked ~~beav~~ otter meat.

""I point at the Archbishop and say ""He pays for our orders!""

""As the bartender looks at the Archbishop, he turns pale, then green, then mutters ""It is on the house"".

""I look at the Archbishop with admiration - this is the man who pays for everything while not paying for anything!""

The Archbishop asks them to bring something out of the Immortal Zoo...

""Do I know anything about this place?""

""As a matter of fact, yes. Your beaver great-grandfather Hugo is rumoured to have been specially picked for the Zoo"".

Yes, something out of the Immortal Zoo - an instruction for making a spell that grants the inhabitants of the Zoo immortality (they can be killed, but never die of hunger or old age, as long as they stay in the Zoo).

So to the Zoo they went. It was a fun and silly adventure, with some situations like...

""Wait, I have a mummufied lizard that can answer one question daily. I ask it how do we defeat this giant snake?""

""You don't. Thank you for asking the mummified lizard"". (The snake was an illusion, and the lizard always answers truthfully but is kind of an asshole)

""The vampire monkey jumps on the goblin from the ceiling, and tries to bite it"".

""On the neck?""

""Umm... the monkey pauses, and hisses ""But where isss the neck on thisss one?""

""I bite the monkey"".

""Roll for it... hmm. You bite the vampire monkey. It shrieks, writhing wildly, as it transforms into a goblin"". (The newly formed goblin briefly joined the party, got pierced with several bits of metal when a cage exploded nearby, and died in a swimming pool surrounded by young women from the noblest family of Vornheim).

Then there was the large egg that the dwarf tried to hatch.

""The eggshell cracks. The cracks widen... and, as the egg falls apart, you see inside it four smaller eggs"".

""Huh. Do we hatch these ones, too?""

""Let's eat them now!""

And that was even before the beaver found the heavily drugged tea.

We agreed to meet next week. I guess I'll be sitting in the nice chair again.

But next time, I'll bring the books, the maps, and the paper minis.",rpg,1654446659.0,0,4632,821

I don't mean ""oh no I'm dead"" upset either (it sucks to lose a character and I'd understand being sad about it), I mean they get aggressively upset. I've had players who refuse to talk to anyone, players who start blaming teammates, even one player who blamed me and said they'd make their next character as broken as they could to ""get back at me."" 

I'm reminded of one dear friend whose level 3 character died to a pack of wolves due to overextending and failing several key roles. He was upset, sulked for about 3 minutes, then jumped into role-playing his character's final moments and got ready to bring in his backup next session. He had always told me he wanted the world to be dangerous, where death was on the line. And when it happened, he responded in a good way. 

So how do you deal with players reacting so badly to character deaths, especially when those players outwardly say they want death to be a possibility?

Me: Hi community, you are all fans of this game... I have questions about the book...

Community: Oh yeah do not bother, go watch this video of the creator running a session. 

Me: Oh its like that again... I see. 

Reasons why this happens:

1) Books are sold to Story Tellers, but rarely have Story Teller content, pure player content. When it comes to 'how do I run this damn game?' there will be next to zero advice, answers or procedures. For example ""There are 20 different playbooks for players!"" and zero monsters, zero tables, zero advice.  

2) Layout: Your book has everything anyone could want... in a random order, in various fonts, with inconsistent boxes, bolding and italics. It does not even have to be 'art punk' like Mork Borg is usable but I can picture one very 'boring' looking book that is nigh unreadable because of this. 

3) 'Take My Money' pitches... the book has a perfect kickstarter pitch like 'it is The Thing but you teach at a Kindergarden' or 'You run the support line for a Dungeon' and then you open the book and well... it's half there. Maybe it is a lazy PBTA or 5e hack without much adapting, maybe it is all flavor no mechanics, maybe it 100% assumes 'you know what I'm thinking' and does not fill in important blanks. 

4) Emperors New Clothes: This is the only good rpg, the other ones are bad. Why would you mention another RPG? This one has no flaws. Yeah you are pointing out flaws but those are actually the genius bits of this game. Everything is a genius bit. You would know if you sat down with the creator and played at a convention.

Hey folks, I decided to do another One Million square-feet of battlemaps. This time it’s a forest.

All original content using Photoshop and photos I take with my phone.

Each, individual map in One Million: Forests comes in 2 versions; the base version and the adventurer version (somewhere for DMs to plot their encounters and adventurers). There are 98 (30x30inch) maps in total, 49 for the base set and 49 for the adventurer version. All of the maps are interconnected to map a giant (over) 1 million square feet of forest.

Some people have been asking if there is an easier way to download these sets, so I have managed to get myself some extra space on Google Drive, zip the map sets into handy folders and put them out there for you to download as full sets. This has cost me a little, so I hope you understand that if you want the sets, you will have to send me a donation on my Ko-Fi page (any size donation will do), and then have access to links for the giant zip files.

You will have access to around 10 million square feet of maps, including:

One Million: The Original (including expansion sets)

One Million: Island (including night versions and expansion sets)

One Million: Deeper Dungeons 

One Million: Dungeon Dimensions (including night versions)

One Million Forest – Base

He is more interested in Spaceships than he is Fantasy, so it was Space for us.

For our first ""story arc"" he would usually just hunt space pirates in his battleship ""the Mater"" (because he also liked Cars), and he loved finding and engaging with Space Pirates. He was quite good at cleaning out pirate infestations. 

I introduced an extremely simple build mechanic where he can generally build whatever he wants with just ""Metal"", more metal he gathers, the more stuff he can build. Eventually, he starts adding new spaceships to his fleet. He has discovered Star Wars so future spaceships he builds are based around Star Wars ships and such.

Anyway, all this culminated not too long ago with him asking me a simple question, ""Daddy, The Death Star would need too much metal for me to build it, right?""

Intrigued, I responded with, ""Yeah, a Death Star is pretty big, it would take far too long to build and gather resources. Wait, why do you need a Death Star?""

Son: ""I was just thinking, if I had a Death Star, and found a planet full of Pirates... I could just destroy the planet and get rid of the Pirates that way""

Me: ""Perhaps we can think of more peaceful means of pacifying than genocide son""

Son: ""Okay Daddy. I can still build a Star Destroyer, right?""

Me: ""You have gathered a lot of Metal recently. Yeah, let's see what we can do on that front.""

My son's interest in RPGs, and specifically what he now refers to as ""The Spaceship Game"" is something him and I have been playing regularly since the start of this year.

187,358,oc80m2,"I recently ""won"" as a GM","No, not what Dexter from Dexter's Laboratory would consider winning. No players died.  
A bit of background I'm sure is familiar to many: When the pandemic started happening, I offered to run a campaign for five of my friends. 

Since we're all familiar with the setting and lore, (and I had just finished the first Ravenor novel), I decided to run a Dark Heresy campaign, giving me ideas and concepts about how to world build in this grim dark universe.  
I'd also just finished playing through the Yakuza franchise. If you don't know anything about these games, they're heavily story-driven games with amazingly well written and voiced characters, every main game bringing tears to my eyes in one way or another, whether it was intentional laughter or genuine sorrow. It really helped me with bringing to life NPCs that would play an important role in the grand mystery of the campaign. In addition to all that my players were absolutely wonderful. Thinking outside of the box when needing, surprising me with their ideas, and all genuinely developing their character as the game went along. 

Mostly we would try to play every 2 or 3, sometimes 4, weeks, and we played for a little over a year.  


Long story short, by the time the campaign had drawn to a close in a final big dungeon crawl that I'd spent a large amount of time on, the players and myself had a keen understanding and emotional attachment to the world, characters, and acolytes (PCs). After the final battle, twist, and ending ""cinematic"", I used fallout as inspiration to give the players an idea of what happened after they had left. After all, they had impacted not just the NPCs they encountered, but the planet's fate as a whole.  
I had a very hard time keeping my voice even as I read the ""credits"" of the game, which sprinkled in which characters were most affected by which player, and how their outlook or actions changed their lives. I was not alone, right after dropping the hammy final line ""because in the 41st Millennium... there is only war"", a couple of my players admitted to having tears in their eyes, and how some really didn't want the game to end.  


I haven't felt this good about a game I've put together in my entire life, and I am so so happy and humbled that I could make my player's lives a little more interesting and fun. Here is to many campaigns more. I'd always dabbled with GMing, now I am definitely hooked.",rpg,1625224792.0,0,2415,428

One player (A) in a game I run is partly closeted trans and wants games they play in to specifically be their chance *not* to make a big deal of it. Retcon the character and never mention it again basically. They were quite clear that they didn't want to play out the headaches they face in real life, which I get. It seems like a helpful outlet for them to get away from that. Ok.

But, a friend of theirs (B) they brought into the group is also trans and really seems to be struggling with it. Even before coming out (to me anyway) they were always wanting to play shapeshifters etc. Basically any character with a hidden identity, and to play those characters as ashamed of and nudge them into embarrassing situations about it. Now that they are out they want to play trans characters and have them actively grapple with that in-game.

The conflict here is obvious. The game is on hiatus for unrelated reasons about the holiday season. I want to figure this out in the meantime.

I hope to encourage them to work it out between themselves. That's not because I'm afraid of the subject though there is a lot I don't understand about it. Rather, A and B know each other much better than I know B. They already talk about trans issues a lot and I think they are dodging this one because they don't want to hurt each other's feelings. If they can get past that they are better equipped for the conversation than I am.

If I must come down on one ""side"" it would be with the A who doesn't want the issue to come up. This is in large part because I think it's good as a rule to let players veto sensitive topics without much pushback. But, I wouldn't know how to let down B gently on the subject.

Do you struggle to write compelling backstories for your characters?

[Back to the Beginning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C7dJwbQNYP9c0lpCFn1GGD2aozA4N2iK/view?usp=sharing) is a little solo STG (storytelling game) made for creating vibrant backstories for characters. It's really simple. You just draw cards, roll dice, and get writing prompts, and then move to the next prompt. So where's the trick?

As the name might clue you in, the game's narrative flows backwards. The first writing prompt you get is the last event that happens to the character before the end of the game. This creates an interesting dynamic where you can engineer a butterfly effect for the character's actions, making the last actions you make in the game, no matter how benign, more meaningful by the fact that the ending has already been written.

Feel free to try it out, leave comments or criticisms. I tried it out myself, and I was quite pleased with the results.

It's not really that much of an RPG as it is a writing prompt generator, but one of its primary purposes is to be able to create backstories for characters, and thus it could prove very useful to many people here.

Reasons why:

1: Good novels make bad games. Bad games make good novels. D&D universe novels are infamously terrible, but everyone knows they would make kickass campaigns if you had players who were that dedicated to role playing. Lord of the Rings, as an rpg campaign, would be railroaded as fuck with too many PCs and massive power/plot importance disparities between them.

2: The GMs I’ve played with who are the most personally invested in their own ideas tend to be the worst GMs. They might be uncomfortable with player creativity or thinking outside the box, often to the point of restricting options that actually are in the game because it doesn’t fit into “their universe.” They might make the lore (that they wrote) far too “mysterious” (inaccessible) for the players with this assumption that it will be “fascinating” when they discover it. They might edit player backstories to fit more to their lore. The worst is when the inaccessible lore combines with editing player backstories.

“This doesn’t work.”
“Why not?”
“I can’t tell you. Do this instead.”

3: Novels are inherently character-based and about a protagonist. Who is your protagonist? If it’s the PCs, they’re going to get railroaded. If it’s an NPC, fuck you. (Sorry, not going to be nice about that one) If it’s your antagonist, you’re probably going to end up being a dick to your players.

There are probably other reasons.

193,371,bjoeis,Artisan Dice Warning,"Hey all, I'm here on the sixth anniversary of the Artisan Dice Kickstarter to warn everyone away from this malicious company.

I, and many other Kickstarter Backers, have yet to receive large portions of our backed rewards, and Artisan Dice has stopped updating the Kickstarter (the last update was July 2017) or responding to anything other than direct e-mails. They've blocked several people from their Facebook page for inquiring about the Kickstarter.

When the Kickstarter began, six years ago, Artisan Dice was just making wooden dice, and through the Kickstarter was expanding into metal. Since the Kickstarter has ended, they've only made a fraction of the metal dice types they said they were going to (for a fun time, check out their website's customer reviews on the metal dice pages which are just full of people asking when they'll be available). They've managed to expand into stone, acrylic, bone (most recently, walrus penis bone, which they posted about four times in the last few days), horn, and compressed hops, but haven't managed to fulfill Kickstarter orders.

I should add, it isn't just Kickstarter orders that don't get filled, but other customers regularly post on their Facebook page asking about orders a year or two unfilled. I'm just fixated on the SIX YEAR unfulfilled Kickstarter stuff because it is the anniversary today.

The RPG community doesn't need the kind of shady businessmen in it that Artisan Dice have displayed themselves to be. Please, for the sake of everyone who hasn't gotten what they've paid for with these guys, don't support this business.

tl;dr - Artisan Dice hasn't fulfilled six year old Kickstarter orders. Don't support them.",rpg,1556755463.0,0,1685,275
194,372,1fk7y7u,Friendly PSA: Do Not Order Physical Miniatures from Hero Forge ,"Just a friendly PSA:

Hero Forge's original distributor (Shapeways) went bankrupt July 2024. However, Hero Forge is still taking orders for physical miniatures without a distributor. I placed an order on August 9th, but my order is still TBD with no delivery date in sight. You may want to buy the STL files instead and print them yourself or have someone else print them for you.

Update: My original order from August 6th was lost or never scanned or whatever. It's been in transit for at least two weeks and hasn't moved. I contacted customer service and asked for a refund. I was given a $10 credit instead. I was also told that a new miniature would be sent my way but I have no real confirmation from Hero Forge that it was ordered and shipped. Instead of a $10 credit, I asked for and was given the codes for two STL files so that I could print these myself or have a 3rd party print them. I will update this post once I receive the miniature.

\*\*\*Last Edit\*\*\*:

My colored Hero Forge miniature arrived today, October 5th. It was ordered on August 9th. I believe $55 for the miniature is a waste of money. In the future, if I use Hero Forge, I will create and purchase the STL files to print myself. ",rpg,1726705462.0,0,1213,224

197,375,5hd12b,Losing a Player,"Three months ago, one of my closer online RP buds was involved in a hit and run. He didn't make it. I only found out one month after the incident, and had assumed he was simply online less because of his new job at the time. Finally finding out left me not knowing what to feel. We had gamed online consistently for a good four years, and had kept in contact through highs and lows, despite frequent arguing and clashes of opinion. 

I was the forever-GM, he was my omnipresent, ever-eager player. Often the driving force in any given campaign's party, and a battery of enthusiasm for everyone to feed off.  

But we had never personally met. There was this inexplicable feeling of disconnect when I found out he was gone. 

I spent the next few days digging up all I could about his online activity. After finally finding a facebook account connected to his, I saw one of his pictures for the first time. And then the sadness hit. He was finally another human being to me. 

I'm posting this here because it's a story I need to tell, and my relatives and work friends will never really understand that connection between a GM and his player. 

So yeah, the next time you're in some pedantic, nerdy as argument with someone in your group, take a step back to appreciate it! That kind of close-knit, hobby oriented relationship is a terrible thing to lose :(

**EDIT**: I was not expecting this strong a response. Thank you so much, everyone, for the kind words and support. There's quite a bit of you to address individually, but yes, I've gotten into contact with mutual friends (of which we had quite a few). His IRL best friend still refuses to chat with me, but I don't begrudge him that. They were the closer pair. I also contacted his mother, to offer my condolences. That gave me the most closure.

As for storytimes: recording and retelling our shenanigans has always been a fixation of mine. It's gotten a lot more painful then necessary recently, but I have a particular excerpt from our old pokemon game I enjoy sharing.

**SCENARIO**: 

Monty Jumps the Pit 

*Dramatis Personae*:

**Monty**: My friend's character, easily his favorite. A young vagabond with a supernatural sway over fungi

**Kaze**: A flying type specialist, owner of the scene's Noivern 

**Bertrand**: An aspiring pokemon breeder. 



*Scene*:

Bert and Kaze, riding Kaze's flying Noivern, are leading a Beedrill hive through the woods, trying to get them to settle in a big tree away from a local village. Monty is also interested in the tree the bees are going to inhabit, and is keeping up with the Noivern on-foot, as he does. 

>Soak (GM): Monty, you're running straight ahead, and manage to glimpse an obvious gap in the otherwise unbroken undergrowth. It's sizeable, and looks deep. You'd likely have to navigate quite a ways to get around it. It does however look narrow enough to jump.

>Bertrand: Don't tell him THAT

>Monty: bout how wide does the gap look? 

Monty decides to play it safe, and run around the gap instead. . . 

>Soak (GM): You slow down, and bank left. It affords you a better view of the sudden hole in the ground, which looks to have a bunch of shining multicolored crystal formations clustered about the bottom of it.
You can't see ALL the way down, though.

>Monty: Hrm

>Monty:temptation

>Bertrand: Jump in. do it. 

. . .but he soon changes his mind

>Monty: ""Hey Bert, dont worry about me, Ima explore this cave!""

>Monty: I jump in

>Kaze: ""Monty....oh....this isn't going to be good.""

>Soak (GM): Lemme clarify that, you jump IN, not across?

>Monty: yes. 

So he does.
>Soak (GM): Monty, you sail into the gap, catching a glimpse of a veritable rainbow of sharp crystal formations before you start plummeting down towards them. At this point you realize they all look rather uncomfortable.

>Monty: no fear.

>Soak (GM): I'll need you to roll acrobatics to try and minimize fall damage. Open to any other ideas as well,.

>Monty: I activate my druids call feature, spending 1 AP to grow a gigantor mushroom up to 6 meters away from me, in this case; directly underneath me on the ground.

We spend a few minutes figuring out the ranges and the cost of his Druid's Call feature. He decides to let himself fall a bit further, so he can get close enough to the pit's bottom to have them pop out from there. 

>Monty: Lets burn my full AP; 6 of it, to properly mushroom my fall up.

>Soak (GM): You pick a spot, channel that spirit flow, and give the ground beneath you a bit of a mental pull.

>Monty: I must channel the Parasect hivemind shrooms that have infected my brain in order to save myself

>Soak (GM): The result is a bit delayed, and the shroom grows out at an angle, shoving some of the crystals out of the way as it bursts out of the ground.

>Monty: Im like the manchurian canidate, but with hivemind-shrooms.

>Soak (GM): It pops out right where you visualized it, but is slightly askew due to the ground not being all ground anymore. It doesn't take much of an effort to land right on it, but the succeeding impact and cloud of harmless spores does manage to wind and choke you a fair bit.

>Soak (GM): You take all of 7 damage and suffer from a twisted...

>Bertrand: butt

>Soak (GM): Arm! You'll also suffer a penalty to melee attacks until somebody patches you up.

>Monty: no fear. no regrets. just ADVENTURE.

So, it's Spring now, and we're still in Ukraine, and things are still going boom. Morning started from checking on friends in Kharkiv, and me being me, all the people I know in Kharkiv are either doctors or Ukrainian fantasy writers. Seems that they're okay, despite the city having been bombed yesterday and today. 

Home chat pings, one of the neighbours brings everyone's attention to the fact that the air raid alarm has been howling for a while now. Swell. From what I know, it's safer to stay inside than to grab the clothes and the bag and run to the shelter. Besides, so far it's only howling but not booming. 

While the alarm continues, I distract myself with roleplaying props. Like I said before, I love paper minis. With things being what they are, I began to think we should have more Ukrainian elements in our sessions. Like, some local monsters and folklore creatures. And some cool minis for the characters. 

I found a couple nice pictures of cossacks on DeviantArt, drawn by dPERCHY and RADIVILOVSKAY. A little tinkering with my printer and my scissors, and voila. I think these would do a nice Barbarian and Bard. After the alarm was over I put them on a flag and took a picture.

Hey folks, I decided to do another One Million square-feet of battlemaps. It’s been a while so this time I thought I’d do a multi-level dungeon.

Deeper Dungeons is another set of 1 million square feet of map, this time exploring 7 levels, from the ruined castle (outdoors), into the dungeon below, and then heading into the caves, only to head further down into a long-lost dungeon complex, from there we delve into the tombs below and finally end up in the Hell Mouth. A total of 16 50inch x 50inch maps.

Please remember, all of my maps, including these (and the gridded versions) are completely free, it’s a way to give back to a hobby that I have enjoyed so much for over 36 years. All I ask is that you don’t sell them, and you credit me wherever possible (if possible).

Some people have been asking if there is an easier way to download these sets, so I have managed to get myself some extra space on Google Drive, zip the map sets into handy folders and put them out there for you to download as full sets. This has cost me a little, so I hope you understand that if you want the sets, you will have to send me a donation on my Ko-Fi page (any size donation will do), and in the ‘thank you’ message, you will find a link to the drive with all the map of my map sets on, including the following:

The Original One Million

One Million Island

One Million Dungeon Dimensions (this is a big one)

… and I have even put on my old Dwarf map set, and the full set of chromatic and metallic dragon lairs and entrances (including night versions)

My page, once you support me, includes the link to all of the Deeper Dungeon maps, including the grid and no grid versions (and hi-res versions of all of them).

Silence, Brand is a 20-page improvisational RPG about a group of anti-corporate activists who give everything they have to fighting the machine. It uses only a single d6, with statistics simple enough for a full character sheet to fit on a flashcard.

Featuring:

-Three very different modes of play, to showcase the wide 
variety of means for direct action.

-A reputation stat that players can use to influence their success rate.

-Bonuses for undertaking real life action, just like the Wendy's RPG--though none that require you to buy and eat what is essentially garbage.

-Absolutely no art of any kind.

-Roughly as much playtesting as acclaimed RPG products like Shadowrun and Exalted.

Take a look, and have fun!

**EDIT**: Just some quick errata:

-Paying 5 reputation to match a roll tieing a target number is way too high. This is has now been changed to 1.

-Added a clarification that the Clout gained from Reputation is only acquired at the end of a Vignette, not Scene.

-Added information about scenes that occur outside of a proper mode of play (i.e., downtime) 

-Added a clarification that donating to good causes can usually only be done during the end of a session or during downtime, and therefore does not add Clout.",rpg,1570297245.0,0,1722,256

* Zweihander Grim and Perilous RPG Revised Edition

I've organized the list into multiple tiers of ubiquity, beginning with the Monster Appearance List (Blue), containing every monster that made at least two total appearances in the 50 games surveyed. Beyond that are five increasingly-strict tiers:

* The Lax tier (Copper) has a 10% threshold: any creature that logged at least five appearances in fifty games appears in the lax tier. Things feel good and complete here.

* The Average tier (Bronze) applies a minimum 20% threshold. Only monsters that appear in at least 10 of the 50 RPGs surveyed are on its list.

* The Strict Tier (Silver) applies a 34% threshold to the monster list. Of the 50 RPGs surveyed, at least 17 featured these favored few monsters.

* The Super Strict Tier (Gold) applies a 50% threshold. If it's fantasy you want, you have coin-flip odds of encountering these top-tier beasts!

* And lastly, the prestigious Impossible Tier (Royal Purple) is host to the monsters it almost seems like a fantasy world can't be without! Only nine lucky monsters reached this tier-- is one of your favorites on it?

In addition we have four special lists:

* Feel like taking things in a more classic direction? The Close Calls: D&D-influenced (White) chart is for you! This list counts 1e, BECMI, 4e, and 5e for double, listing the monsters that would have been upgraded from Copper to Bronze tier if we had done so all along!

* Or maybe you'd rather get out from under D&D's shadow a little? The Close Calls: D&D-Null (Pink) chart contains the monsters that would hit a 20% threshold of 9 total games-- without any official version of D&D or Pathfinder 2e in the mix whatsoever!

Lastly we have two appendices:

* The Unexpurgated Monster List (Green) is a complete list of all monsters that appeared in the survey at least once.

* The Unique Monster List (Red) records all monsters who made only a single appearance in the list across all 50 titles!

**Where Do We Go From Here?**

That's a good question and I'm glad you asked! I created this list in the interest of pursuing the scholarly study of tropes, traditions, and cliches in fantasy RPGs. To that end I'd like to turn to the roleplaying community in search of further expansion upon the chart. Every entry on the list (more than 1400 in the complete, unexpurgated list), with the exception of well-known natural creatures and a few other classics sufficiently universal and consistent to take for granted, has been annotated with a definition explaining what the entry represents-- in part to account for differences in nomenclature applying to similar concepts.

The first thing this could use is peer review. Have I neglected any entries, or made a judgment call you don't agree with? This is the place to reach out to me about it! 

The second thing I'd like to do next is to create other special lists, studies, and other information that could arise from the data I've collected. If you have any suggestions for studies or experiments that could be performed using the information at hand, reach out to me about them and I'll be happy to conduct them. I believe there is much to learn from what I've assembled here, but I'm not always the best at creative, lateral applications of it, so I turn to the community to ask what we can create next.

Edit: A few people have reached out to me about this so I just wanted to clarify:

#I generally only used the core rules for each game listed. On occasion I used a single supplemental bestiary where I felt the core rules were running short or where the supplemental bestiary was in universal usage. In only one case (The One Ring) did I use any more than that because TOR is extremely sparse on monsters. You can see in the notes for the first row what products were included for each game.

This means for instance that I didn't include the Fiend Folio and Monster Manual II under AD&D 1e, just the Monster Manual. That *alone* accounted for the second-biggest set of monsters in this entire project with over 300 entries.",rpg,1621115205.0,0,5577,969

It's a pretty common refrain I've heard more than once: ""There aren't enough DMs to go around! Everyone wants to play, but no one wants to run games!""

Everyone wants to play? *Really?*

Suppose I tell you that I'm going to start running a game of D&D, and I'm looking for players. Do you want to join up?

Now, suppose I tell you that I'm not allowing homebrew, and I'm running the game RAW. Are you still interested?

Now, imagine that I'm telling you that it's a PHB-only game. Still up for it?

Or imagine that it's not D&D at all, but a nice high-fantasy game of Savage Worlds, and ""D&D"" is just a term people throw around, like ""Xerox"" and ""Kleenex."" *What about now?*

The problem isn't that there's a shortage of DMs/GMs/whatever, the problem is that there's a shortage of people who will run games *to your exacting specifications*. People expect D&D to be like Monopoly or Risk; everyone's using the same rules out of the box, so if my last two DMs let me take character options from Xanathar's, but this DM won't, that clearly means there's a ""DM shortage.""

There is no DM shortage. There's just an excess of spoiled players who refuse to play in games that will give them everything they desire.",rpg,1670593153.0,0,1338,219

214,400,96swom,"Report: Netflix ""Audio Description"" has made me a much better Game Master","Some time ago, I was listening to a bonus episode on some gaming podcast - I don't remember which one anymore, but I'm sure someone else will - that was talking about DM advice. One of the weird almost throw-away suggestions was to use Audio Description options in Netflix. I laughed, but still decided to give it a try.

Several months later, I can attest that it was the wise thing to do. My partner _hates_ it when they watch things with me, but they are getting used to it. It's made me a better GM/DM, and my games both tabletop and recorded have vastly improved because of it.

What am I talking about? Netflix (and possibly Amazon?) has an option on most if not all of its original programming - and others too - where you can select ""English - Audio Description"" as an Audio choice. When you do so, you hear the normal dialog, but there is also a narrator telling you what is physically happening on the screen as well. It doesn't interrupt the actors, either. I've experienced this long ago when renting movies from the local public library that were ""enhanced for the vision impaired"" or such - my first exposure was Breakfast at Tiffany's, in fact.

I've turned it on by default, and now everything I watch uses it when available. It has really expanded my ability to describe scenes and events in-game, and I highly encourage anyone who wants to step up their GMing game to give it a shot. The way the narrators describe things is pretty interesting, and has even expanded my regular vocabulary.

Give it a shot, let me know what you think.

EDIT: Oh yeah, advance warning here, that sometimes the narration is a few seconds ahead of the actual action on screen, I suspect due to it not wanting to conflict with dialog. So sometimes events will be described a few seconds before they happen. So if you're the kind who is bothered by like three-second spoilers, it might not be for you. it's definitely an ""acquired taste"" so to speak.",rpg,1534112475.0,0,1946,352

Racial stats are racist. Racial stats are not racist. Racial stats are a reflection of cultural assumptions. Racial stats are a reflection of biology.   

This argument is never gonna end and while discussions of the gameplay implications are cool n' all, it's pretty clear everyone's sick of the rest of it.  

Long story short, if you've got Elves n' Dwarves n' shit, I think the kicker here is those aren't ""races"" if you're being pedantic.  
A lot of the discomfort lies in conflating a *different species* to different ""races"" of human beings.  

A Dwarf is not to a Human as an Indian human is to a central African human. In most RPG settings these are fairly different comparisons.   

If conflating the two makes you uncomfortable, but you still want those ""racial bonuses""... Consider picking a **species** rather than a **race**. It's certainly what I'm doing for my Mythras hack.

**UPDATE:** I need to accept payments before you get the link to the maps... it's apparently a PayPal thing. I have to do this manually, and I now need to go to work. So, if you do donate, please be aware that I'll be able to accept periodically, throughout the day. Thank you for your patience! 

&#x200B;

Over the last year I have been creating battlemaps for our community to use. I have created 3 projects of ‘One Million’ square feet of maps (well, one of those was 2.25 million square feet). All the maps are ready for use in virtual tabletops.

There are versions with grids, no grids, and even night versions for those maps that are set outdoors.

My maps are free, and a way to give back to the community that I have been part of for almost 4 decades. You can find all the free versions on my Deviant Art page.

Some people have been asking if there is an easier way to download these sets, so I have managed to get myself some extra space on Google Drive, zip the map sets into handy folders and put them out there for you to download as full sets. This has cost me a little, so I hope you understand that if you want the sets, you will have to send me a donation on my Ko-Fi page (any size donation will do), and in the ‘thank you’ message, after I accept the payment, you will find a link to the drive with all the map sets on, including the following:

The Original One Million

One Million Island

One Million Dungeon Dimensions (this is a big one)

… and I have even put on my old Dwarf map set.

A total of over 5 million square feet of battlemap.

220,409,10djpv6,Worlds Without Number is worth a look,"I've enjoyed reading the posts by other people recommending the systems they like, so I thought I would recommend one of my favorites, _Worlds Without Number_. 

**Why should you check it out?**

Well, first of all, I think it's fun to play...it's got a nice mix of rules that are easily accessible, especially for anyone with D&D experience.  More on that in a minute.  But that's just my opinion, people like different sorts of RPGs.

However, there are two other reasons that you might want to look at it, regardless of whether or not you expect to actually play it:  

1)  It's mostly [available for free](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348809/Worlds-Without-Number-Free-Edition).  The free version contains the vast bulk of what I'm about to talk about.  The [paid version](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348791/Worlds-Without-Number) has a few extra classes and rules for high level play.

2) It's got really neat system-neutral GM tools for generating content that you can use in just about any fantasy themed rpg.  Can't beat that kind of value for your money.     

**What sort of game is this?**

_Worlds Without Number_ is inspired by the broader [OSR](https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/roleplaying-game/feature/what-is-osr-old-school-rpg-classic-dnd) (Old School Renaissance) movement.  In particular, it favors a sandbox style of play where players set their own goals, the world is dangerous, and fighting isn't always the best option.  

The rules for combat will be pretty familiar to anyone used to playing D&D or other games derived from it...the standard six attributes, roll a 20 to attack, etc.  (However, it _doesn't_ use the OGL).  There is a skill system that is similar to the one used in _Traveler_.  You roll 2d6, add your skill level and an attribute.  There are three major classes, skill focused experts, combat focused warriors, and magic focused mages.  These can be combined with each other or mixed with various subclasses to produce a wide variety of characters.  And there are foci (feats/special abilities) that let you customize your character even further.     

**Why do I like it?**

1) I like the skill system.  There's enough meat on it that it doesn't feel like an afterthought to combat.  The skill list isn't too big, but really does a good job of covering almost everything.  And the 2d6 system makes skill rolls more consistent than d20 rolls in D&D.  There's a pretty sweet crafting system tied into it too.  

2) Combat goes pretty fast, but it's got enough options to keep me interested.  One way this differs from other systems is the addition of shock damage...if you melee attack someone, and their armor is low enough, you'll _always_ do a few HP worth of damage, even if you miss.  This represents the minor injuries resulting from close combat that occur even when there's no direct hit.  This helps keep combat moving along, since you are almost always losing HP.  Players also have options for things to do in combat besides direct attacks, but there aren't so many that they are hard to keep track of.

3) The ability to combine classes, the foci, and the skills provide enough crunch to character creation to keep me interested.  You may think a game with only three classes would be lacking in character options, but between different subclasses and the ability to combine two half-classes, plus a variety of foci (feats, basically), plus being able to specialize in different skills, there's a lot of ways to build a character.  This gets even more true if you use classes from the paid version or the setting book, _[The Atlas of Latter Earth](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/416284/The-Atlas-of-the-Latter-Earth)_.    The downside is that this does mean that you can't just spin up a character in a few moments, like you can with some other OSR games.  

4)  The GM tools are really handy.  There are lots of tables to roll on for ideas, plus methods for setting up a hexcrawl map, making a dungeon, and even a method for running factions.
 
5) Characters are really good at what they do.  This isn't a game where the warriors get outclassed at killing stuff by wizards tossing fireballs.  But wizard spells are also really powerful.  And experts get more skills and are better at using them.  

6) There's a compatible scifi version, _[Stars Without Number](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/230009/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition-Free-Version)_.  I was running a game set in a scifi-fantasy mashup (using the awesome setting of Ultraviolet Grasslands) and it was really handy to be able to draw a lot of material from Stars Without Number.  A niche use, I know, but really handy for me.  There's also an upcoming cyberpunk version, _Cities Without Number_, but it's not out yet.

7) There's a lot of compatible materials.  Like a lot of OSR games, you can pretty much pull monsters or adventures from other OSR systems or old DnD modules, which means there's plenty of content out there to pull from.

I am the author of an indie-rpg called **Slay the Dragon!** and today it came to my attention that my game has been used to start a heated argument which went as far as the post being tweeted by Indestructoboy. I am writing this to share a perspective of a creator being on the receiving end of the stick because and also to share why I think that rhetoric presented by OP is actively harmful to what he wants to achieve.

**By being oblivious to the context, you are actively discouraging foreign authors from attempts to publish abroad.** 

In certain countries such as Poland where I come from the access to D&D is not as easy as in USA. It might be expensive, it might be hard to get, and it might not be available in the local language altogether. I created Slay the Dragon to be affordable, have a box set form and be easily accessible due to the generic fantasy theme. The game was warmly received, so I decided to share it with the international audience. By being ignorant to that context and claiming it’s just another unnecessary take on D&D, you are making it harder for us to do it. 

**Instead of complaining about D&D, give few indie games a real shot and you might actually see that a lot of them are more similar to the games you mentioned as ones you like.** 

Everything will be D&D if you are so desperate to see it everywhere. I won’t deny, yes my game is about dungeon crawling, yest it uses the popular d20 die and yes it is written with generic fantasy in mind. But it is also so much more. It actually makes dungeon exploration a mechanic within the game. And it binds this mechanic with combat and other parts of the game via the system of abstract resources. Resources that are abstract in order to bring a little bit of the joy of spontaneous creativity from story games into it. But to get all of that, you actually need to read into the game. Please do not make superficial judgments, just to have something to complain about.

**The post as the one that started the conversation might be enough to bury a project such as us together with all the love and work we gave it.** 

It’s incredibly hard to be an indie creator as it is. For me, publishing my games is a way of sharing results of a process I love. My game didn’t start as a scheme to make a quick buck. Me and the illustrator of the game who is a dear friend of mine wanted to create something together, and so we did. Hundreds of hours later, we had something we were proud of. But that’s only a small part of the battle, as we have to reach an audience. And without marketing resources to rival corporations or being in the inner circle of people who like to fashion themselves indie-rpg content creators, it’s really hard task. So please, for the love of god, think about the consequence of your actions.

They've been scouring the city for any evidence of her wrongdoing, and planning to bring her down by means fair and foul. It all started to come to a climax last week when they planned, with the assistance of the local authorities, to unmask her at a party, and trap her. However, all did not go exactly to plan and the Vampire escaped (in the form of a Giant Bat) from the party and retreated to her lair.

We've had an absolutely wonderful response to the Wildsea so far, and I'd love for as many people to see it as possible. 


**Mechanics**

The Wildsea draws mechanically from Belly of the Beast, Blades in the Dark, 13th Age and Dialect, and also from video games like Bastion, Sunless Sea and Subnautica. It has a heavy narrative slant, a dash of in-character worldbuilding and a focus on dramatic action and exploration. This is weird fantasy, through and through. 


**Setting**

It takes place on a treetop sea, the canopy of a vast forest that ate the world. You play wildsailors, crews of those brave (or foolhardy) enough to set out across the rustling waves in ships of your own creation. You might be a weathered descendant of humanity, a towering cactoid, a spry fungal hunter or a hive-mind of spiders in a humanesque skin.

227,421,dswwst,"Why I stopped playing one of my favorite games, and how it affected one of my players.","So, I have been DMing for my group for a long time. Some of them are childhood friends, and were among the first people I DM'ed for, over 15 years ago. We had our ups and downs, both in ""real life"" and ""in game"", but we always have had a  crazy ammount of fun. 

Before we even finished our 10-year long Star Wars campaign, all of us knew what we were going to play next: Midnight. Midnight is an extremely well-written d&d 3.5 dark fantasy setting from Fantasy Flight Games, which explores the themes of desperate heroism in a doomed world, like a darker ""what if Morgoth won forever"" version of Middle Earth. I was a big fan of the setting since it was first published, and through the years I had purchased every sourcebook of the line.

Now, I must say that our Star Wars campaign had it all: laughs, cries, light hearted themes, dark themes, sacrifice, personal growth. I knew it would be difficult for all of us to do better than that, but we were all about to try with our new game. So I got to work. I wrote the broad script for a campaign that would take 3-4 years of gaming. We rolled characters and I designed each one's personal story. 

Sidenote: a few months after we started our new campaign, I quit my previous job and got a new one which was infinitely more demanding. I had to work 11-14 hours per day, and it quickly exhausted me both physically and mentally. 

On a ""positive"" note, my new job quickly caused my mood to go downhill, which really made writing about Midnight seem a natural process. Dark themes and desperation were living constntly in my head, so it was easy for me to bring them to our table. And it was a success. The players loved it. My beast friend wrote a poem after one particularly emotional session. As members of a doomed resistance, I even caught them whispering irl while discussing tactics/roleplaying in their hideaway. That was when I understood that I was not having fun with the game. Because, I need humor in my games, as much as I need adult themes. I need a rainbow of emotions, a changing of mood. I cannot fully express myself otherwise.

After 2 years in my ""new"" job, which caused me health problems (and depression which I kept secret from everyone even after I recongized that I had it), I quit. And soon after, I told my players I would take a break from Midnight, after one and a half years of running it. Soon after, I told them that I was not returning to the game. They never made a scene or anything. They were dissapointed, but they understood. 

 All of us began a new campaign in the Witcher rpg, which was like a healing potion for me. For the past year I am running the game, and I am driving my players crazy by buying new rpgs every now and then, ""threatening"" them that they are soon going to have to learn new systems because I want to play a ton of things, like I did when I was younger.

Only ""bad"" thing is, one member of our group didn't want to play anymore. One of my best players, with whom I always enjoyed gaming, said that he isn't motivated to play a new game. When we got to discuss his decision, he told me he needs a strong sense of nostalgia in order to enjoy a game. He loved Star Wars because he grew up with it, and he loved Midnight because he has always been a big Tolkien fan. Personally, I still think he felt a little bit betrayed by my decision to ""kill"" the MN campaign, but he is a cool dude and he would never make a scene. I offered to DM any other game he and the rest of the group would like, as a parallel campaign to our Witcher game he did not join, but he seemed disisinterested at the time. Funny thing is, I was always confident that he would flourish under the Witcher system, and he would have loved it if he gave it a chance. He has always played characters who are socially adept and he is one hell of a roleplayer, with a great sense of humor.  

Finally, we agreed to play a Cyberpunk Red game when it is released.

Still, the whole situation reminded me why I love rpgs. Different people find different reasons to play and love this hobby. My friend mainly does it for nostalgia, and I believe I mainly do it to explore different themes with each different game. Themes, that create questions in my mind which I love to see answered by my players' choices.

Anyway, sorry for the long post and my poor english, it is something that I felt I wanted to express.",rpg,1573128951.0,0,4391,828

# 📐 Structuring adventures

Adventures are single scenarios within the larger narrative of a campaign. Scenes (or nodes) are the basic building blocks of adventures \[[AG](https://theangrygm.com/between-adventure-and-encounter/)\]. An adventure’s structure determines how PCs advance from one scene (or node) to the next \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/15126/roleplaying-games/game-structures)\]. A single adventure may include overlapping, nested or blended structures \[[KO](https://knightattheopera.blogspot.com/2021/08/princess-mononoke-and-dm-prepared-plots.html?m=0)\].

**Procedural** structures encourage *emergent* narratives; require prepared *tools.*

* **Dungeon crawl:** Choose a doorway or room exit.
* **Hex/grid crawl:** Choose an adjacent hex/square.
* **Point crawl:** Choose a connected point of interest.
* **Node-based:** Collect clues that reveal connected nodes \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/45263/roleplaying-games/the-secret-life-of-nodes)\].

**Story-driven** structures encourage *directed* narratives; require prepared *plans*.

* **Linear:** Follow hooks to the next scene.
* **Branching:** Follow hooks to one of several possible scenes (often progressing to a single climax).
* **Mystery:** Collect clues that lead to the next scene.

Adventures should never have foregone conclusions. Even where the number of choices is limited, the players should still have *agency* (i.e., the feeling that their choices matter) \[[MC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqIZytzzFKU)\].

Making player choices *meaningful* requires sufficient context (information), viable alternatives (choice) and lasting consequences (impact) \[[CM](https://www.bastionland.com/2018/09/the-ici-doctrine-information-choice.html)\].

## Adventure templates

Generic structures for quickly outlining story-driven adventures.

## The Five-Room Dungeon [[JF](https://www.roleplayingtips.com/5-room-dungeons/)]

1. **Entrance:** Guardian or secret; reason why the dungeon is unexplored/unresolved.
2. **Obstacle:** Puzzle or roleplaying challenge; closes off the climax and/or reward.
3. **Setback:** Trap, trick or other unforeseen complication; foreshadows climax.
4. **Climax:** Central challenge of the dungeon.
5. **Reward:** Treasure, information and/or twist.

## The Five-Node Mystery [[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/37903/roleplaying-games/5-node-mystery)]

1. **Hook:** Introduction to the mystery; includes clues to each of the POIs.
2. **POIs (x3):** People and/or places related to the mystery; each includes clues to the other POIs and to the reveal.
3. **Reveal:** Ultimate answer to the mystery; often a confrontation.

## The Quest [[LK](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/102507/Situations-For-Tabletop-Roleplaying)]

1. **Hook:** Introduction to the situation; preparation for the journey.
2. **Acquisition:** Recovery of essential object or device. 
3. **Challenges:** Beginning of journey; predictable perils.
4. **Complications:** Continuation of journey with twist on the challenges; fallout from new information.
5. **Closure:** Delivery of object to final destination; reveal and aftermath.

# 🚀 Instigating adventures

Adventures are born from the movement of fronts (i.e., goal-oriented threats) \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/4147/roleplaying-games/dont-prep-plots)\] \[[PA](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html)\]. The PCs are drawn into and through adventures with hooks. Dynamic and engaging adventures occur at the intersection of multiple fronts and hooks \[[SR](http://rolltop-indigo.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-big-list-of-rpg-plots.html)\].

## Fronts

Dangers to the PCs and the things they care about \[[DW](https://www.dwsrd.org/gm/fronts.html)\]; advance independently of the PCs. Fronts comprise:

* **Linked threats:** Villains, hordes, organizations, cursed places, etc.
* **Goals:** Motivations or drives associated with each threat.
* **Timelines:** Sequences of consequences of each threat progressing toward its goal (i.e., countdown clocks); actions that trigger encounters \[[JF](https://www.roleplayingtips.com/rptn/how-to-spend-even-less-time-prepping-dynamic-campaigns/)\].
* **Stakes:** What we are playing to find out; open-ended questions about how the front will impact the PCs and/or the world.

Neutral or allied factions can function like fronts by replacing threats with *assets* \[[KC](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348809/Worlds-Without-Number-Free-Edition)\]. Simple threats require only a goal and a 3-step timeline \[[MS](https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/return-of-the-lazy-dungeon-master)\].

## Hooks

Dramatic challenges that the PCs are motivated to take on; primary adventure objectives \[[KC](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348809/Worlds-Without-Number-Free-Edition)\] \[[SR](http://rolltop-indigo.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-big-list-of-rpg-plots.html)\].

* **Combat:** Defeat, assassinate, interrupt or protect someone. Cleanse or defend somewhere. Destroy, neutralize or secure something.
* **Exploration:** Scout, navigate, infiltrate, escape, race or survive somewhere. Collect, steal, deliver, restore or activate something. Rescue, escort or track someone.
* **Investigation:** Discover, decipher, solve or locate something.
* **Social:** Persuade, deceive, intimidate or interrogate someone. Negotiate or administer something.

*Proactive* hooks come looking for the PCs; *reactive* hooks require proactive players to discover them \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/44541/roleplaying-games/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-scenario-hook)\].

# 🛠️ Preparing adventures

Prepared materials facilitate gameplay within an adventure structure.

**Tools** are materials that support procedural and/or improvised gameplay.

* **Maps:** Keyed \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/35180/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-the-key)\], rostered \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/38547/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-the-key-part-4-adversary-rosters)\] or blank.
* **Lists:** NPCs (names, descriptions, roles), locations (landmarks, settlements, taverns), etc.
* **Random tables:** Encounters \[[WS](https://www.prismaticwasteland.com/blog/hexcrawl-checklist-part-two)\], reactions, treasures, events, etc.
* **Stat blocks:** Monsters, NPCs, hazards, items, etc.
* **Clues:** Rumours, secrets \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/40978/roleplaying-games/random-gm-tip-using-revelation-lists)\], etc.
* **Timelines:** Calendars \[[WS](https://www.prismaticwasteland.com/blog/calendars-not-just-maps)\], countdown clocks, etc.

**Plans** are materials that support linear and/or directed gameplay.

* **Outlines:** Quest logs, scene summaries \[[AG](https://theangrygm.com/like-players-do/)\], flowcharts, etc.
* **Scripts:** Dialogue, exposition, cut scenes, etc.
* **Set pieces:** Encounters, puzzles, etc.

Flexible, reusable and/or impactful tools are more versatile and are often less work to prepare than unadaptable, excessive and/or redundant plans (i.e., scripted contingencies), even for story-driven adventures \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/37422/roleplaying-games/dont-prep-plots-tools-not-contingencies)\].

# 📋 Preparing sessions

Review checklist before each session \[[MS](https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/return-of-the-lazy-dungeon-master)\]. Skip steps addressed during adventure prep \[[MS](https://slyflourish.com/choosing_the_right_steps.html)\]. Recycle unused prep \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/39893/roleplaying-games/smart-prep-part-2-the-principles-of-smart-prep)\] \[[PA](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html)\].

1. **Review the characters:** What do the players care about? What is on the PCs’ current to-do list \[[AG](https://theangrygm.com/angry-open-world-lesson-three-part-one/)\]?
2. **Create a strong start:** Set the stage with action, roleplay or mystery. Drive the adventure forward by advancing fronts \[[DW](https://www.dwsrd.org/gm/fronts.html)\].
3. **Outline potential scenes:** Anticipate next steps for the PCs (1-2 scenes per hour of play).
4. **Define secrets and clues:** Discrete pieces of information not tied to any one source (10 total). Consider fronts, hooks, lore and PC backstories. For essential secrets (i.e., narrative chokepoints), provide at least three different clues \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule)\].
5. **Develop interesting locations:** Evocative titles each with three unique aspects (1-2 locations per hour of play).
6. **Outline important NPCs:** Description (name, appearance), personality (archetype or quirk) and connection to the adventure (motivation or hook) \[[JF](https://www.roleplayingtips.com/rptn/the-3-line-npc-method-how-to-create-story-full-npcs-fast/)\].
7. **Choose relevant monsters:** Compile stat blocks and review abilities.
8. **Select rewards:** Treasure, magic items and/or secrets. Incorporate hooks for new adventures.

Where feasible, prepare high-impact extras (e.g., player-facing maps, handouts, images, music) for greater engagement.

229,424,adyc9b,How I gave up on being a great GM and decided to be a mediocre one,"I've been running games since 1990s. 

When I started as a teen, I did all the fumbling mistakes we all do. But I learned from them. I listened to my players. I learned to play them, give them the things they found fun. Then I learned how to open new vistas for them, how to lure people used to rollplaying D&D into roleplaying something completely different and so forth. During the years I moved from place to place and ran campaigns for dozens of groups. Players would design their weekly schedule around my games, so they'd make into them. Some players became fans, driving half a day to play in my games a couple of times a year. Some groups I still run games for occasionally like that. 

I used to make handouts and props. I'd write letters the characters received and roll them around in ash and water to make them puzzles in themselves. I'd draw maps and find pictures for all the NPCs, design soundtracks for each session. My campaigns would draw from the stories the players designed for their characters. There would be personal spotlights for each character and many times NPCs from their friends, families and enemies. Some plot arcs would take years in real time to mature... and so on and so on. 

All this consumed time, of course. 

I'd spend time and effort creating those items. I'd be thinkign about the campaign plots while in shower and exercising. I'd write them down in a cafe. That was okay though. I really liked seeing the wow-faces of players or hear them talk about my old games years later the same way people talk about their favorite movies. 

I don't do that anymore. 

I've given up on personal spotlights and character-based NPCs. I no longer spend time on handouts or other material. I don't spend time thinking how player actions affect the world at large. Instead I just write down the main core for a campaign and improvise the rest on the spot. I heavily plagiarise old RPG material I've read years ago or rerun old campaigns to new players. 

The reason is pretty simple. Players have become unreliable in their attendance lately. I don't know why, is it because of social media? Regardless of their status in life (children or lack of them, whether they work hard or not etc), they cancel at last minute or don't come to the session at all. I might expect five players, but only three come or the game gets cancelled two days before the agreed day. I don't think it is that I'd be running bad games suddenly; I've still received only praise and I still run games occasionally for people from my old groups. I'm still having fun, but... the difficulty of organizing games and the way people fade from them... it has killed my mood. 

So yeah, campaigns don't feel like worth it anymore. So I don't put in so many chips either. It is a shame. I miss running those really good campaigns. But I don't think it is worth it if the effort is not respected. 

It is not a question of having just a bad group either - I've noticed the same with three different groups during the last year, with a total of twelve players. 

Pardon me if this post seems egoistic. I just wanted to say it aloud somewhere anonymously, so I don't seem like I'm blaming my current players. RPGs are just a hobby, I get it. I don't expect people to put them first in their lives. But somehow, telling weeks ahead that you can't make it versus just not coming... those are so completely different to me and they've sapped my motivation. ",rpg,1546978062.0,0,3448,624
230,426,n9dfe4,Would a system-agnostic book on how to make interesting and realistic cults be of value to anyone?,"EDIT: Ok I'm convinced, work on this book starts this week. 

A few years ago I realized I was born and raised inside a cult. In the process of leaving I've read a ton of information on how different cults operate, and how they are the same. I've been debating wiring a short book drawing from my experience and other sources on how to make cults more interesting and realistic. 

For example, many RPG cult members lead with their most insane doctrines. They may tell someone directly that they're going to sacrifice people to Cthulhu, and that's not generally how cults present themselves. Scientologists talk about mental health issues, not aliens. Mormons talk about family values, not getting a whole planet to yourself. Jehovah's Witnesses offer ""Home Bible Studies"", but don't lead by telling people Jehovah is going to kill them, etc. So a realistic RPG Cthulhu cult would talk about helping people live their life to the fullest (by killing themselves for Cthulhu). 

Anyway, just something I've been thinking about putting together. If there's any interest I'll make it a reality.",rpg,1620674058.0,0,1090,182
231,427,f4a3c3,"A ""Brutalist"" Dungeon","A couple of weeks ago I posted this thread: [\[LINK\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/evld4u/tips_for_a_brutalist_dungeon/) to /r/dndnext and this post is a follow up to that - it went well over there, so I'm posting it here too to see if anyone here is interested. 

Something is in my world which is *so unnaturally abhorrent* that the world itself (called Gaia) has had a reaction to it, and formed a cocoon around it, like a pearl around a piece of grit in an oyster. My players are trying to get to the grit in the centre of this pearl, which means travelling through a structure with the following properties:

1. It’s not man-made, there does not *need* to be any way through it whatsoever. 
2. Because it wasn't ""built"", it doesn't need to accommodate a person’s passage through it, there aren't corridors, stairs, rooms. 
3. My players do need to pass through it somehow, it is a game after all. 

I wanted to create a feeling of otherworldliness, isolation and loneliness – like they are in a place which was not built for them, and in fact an architecture which passively rejects their presence – a sort of structural violence. The inspiration was heavily influenced by House of Leaves, and [Jacob Geller’s video on Brutalism and NaissanceE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkv6rVcKKg8). 

So, here is what I did: 
First off, features of the structure itself. The entire structure is built of a disorienting material, similar to [bismuth](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1tvoZqf5TBuNjSspmq6yDRVXa4/Bismuth-Crystals-100g-Bismuth-Metal-crystal.jpg) in that the surface reflects light in a curious shifting way. It is unlike any material they’ve ever seen before, and seems to have no particular beneficial properties (so there is not a particular compunction to hack at the wall with pick axes). 
They never found a “corridor”, they were always squeezing into cracks in a wall. Every crack snaked and shifted, at times they had to squeeze through spaces no wider than a foot, and at others the crack opened up into impossibly large chasms and open spaces. Like chambers in some great organ. Occasionally, to get through to another area, they had to pull away thin membranes of the crystal – like spun sugar. 

I created a D100 roll table:

* 1 - 5 – back to the start 
* 6 - 15 – a chamber (small) 
* 16 – 30 – a chamber (large) 
* 31 - 35 – a corridor 
* 36 - 50 – a vertical shaft
* 51 - 60 – a chasm (wide)
* 61 - 65 – a chasm (wide with “bridge”)
* 66 -70 – a chasm – narrow, no discernible exit on the opposing side.
* 71 - 80 – a slope (steep)
* 81 - 85 – a slope (gradual)
* 86 – 91 – solid wall blocks path.
* 92 – 99 – naturally formed stairs.
* 100 – a dead end, turn back.  

And each time they entered a new area they’d roll on the table. Ultimately, I had them roll twice on the table and they rolled a 65 (large chasm w/ “bridge”) and, curiously, 66 (narrow chasm, no discernible exit). This translated into two interesting encounters, connected by cracks in the structure and finally leading to my scripted room at the end:

1. The Large Chasm
2. The Narrow Chasm
3. The Abyss

**The Large Chasm - 65**

As they paw their way through a dark crack in the structure, the leading party member discovers that the floor they are walking on abruptly ends and drops into an impossible deep chasm. They are wearing a robe of eyes, which gives them darkvision of 120ft, so they can see an equally sheer wall 100ft across this abyss, they also spotted a narrow crack in the opposite wall some 50ft down and right from where they were. 

The roll table called for a “bridge” but I didn’t want to just give them one – so they had to investigate and found that there were crystals jutting out of the wall on their side which might be used as a makeshift stairs (if they began to traverse them they’d spot a number of structures they could use as a bridge). My intention was to have a few dicey dexterity checks, with perhaps some usage of ropes and pulleys, or someone to fly over and affix a rope they could swing across.  

But, of course, players are infinitely resourceful – and even though, at level 10, they’ve only got one player who can fly, they do have a wizard with Wall of Force. The walls are impassable, invisible and can be arranged however you like – so our wizard arranged them step-wise crossing the abyss. Of course, it was still unnerving to effectively step out into nothingness, and doubly so when you are standing on nothingness and you have to make a drop of several feet to the next invisible platform below. Our rogue marked the hard surfaces with a chalk, to help guide the way. 
Our Totem Barbarian communed with nature, connecting with the ley of this place – and found it to be entirely natural, but incredibly hostile. Like the structure itself was violent. 

**The Narrow Chasm – 66**

They spent another hour winding through the crack on the other side of the chasm, eventually reaching a point where it looked like a dead end. Approaching the dead end, however, they discovered that there was in effect a “crawl space” of about three feet down which they could shimmy the 150ft to the ground below. Our rogue (with Second Story Work) shimmied down and explored the surface, it was spiky – like the ends of the crystals were jutting through the ground, which made it difficult terrain. Not a problem if you made a save, but you’d prick yourself for 1d8 damage if not. The rogue explored the bottom of the chasm: to the left it abruptly ended with another sheer wall, but to the right the valley curved around a corner and seemed to narrow some 120ft ahead. I made them make a save as she stepped on a piece of uncertain ground and it gave way, revealing a deep dark shaft roughly 5ft across. She clambered back up to the rest of the party, and sent the Bard down into the newly discovered shaft to investigate through the use of Fly. 

**The Abyss (part 1)**

At the bottom of this new shaft was an opening into an impossibly large and impossibly dark space. No voice echoed in this chamber, and even with his dwarven dark vision – the bard couldn’t see any other surfaces save for the one through which he had just descended. Anyone falling down that shaft would drop out into pure pitch darkness, with no frame of reference, not even a surface to fall and die on – just nothing. He began to get twitchy, hanging in the darkness – like someone who had chiselled a hole in an ice layer, but was afraid he would lose track of the hole. He likened it to dropping into deep water, where you can’t tell which way is up and which way is down. He quickly flew back up the shaft and advised the party that it certainly wasn’t the way to go. 

**The Abyss (part 2)**

The party all clambered down the narrow chasm to the floor below (well, the bard failed the athletics check and fell – taking 41 damage on the spiked ground below, but that’s neither here nor there). They avoided the gaping opening down into the abyss, and continued on and into a crack in the wall beyond. Eventually this led to my final chamber of the pearl: a gigantic featureless room. 

**The Gigantic Featureless Room**

This is the room which almost broke my players, they’d been travelling in pitch blackness for the entire day. The environment offered absolutely no respite, there was no space to camp, no natural light, not even any hostile occupants – just silent, pitch blackness. And this is the state in which they entered the final test I had for them: 
A huge room with smooth flat floors, pitch blackness as far as even the most proficient dark vision user could see. They had a wall on their right, extending into the darkness, and the wall through which they’d entered which extended way to their left into similar darkness – and the intersection of these two walls at a corner nearby on their right. Bisecting these two walls, directly diagonal to them into the blackness was… nothing… just endless nothing. 

They surprised me by immediately striking out directly into the darkness. I’d envisaged they’d explore along the walls first, but they didn’t – they tied a rope to one person and then headed out into the darkness as far as their 50ft of rope would take them – then they saw what they could see. 

Nothing, of course. The room seemed to extend infinitely into the darkness. They sent out the warlock’s imp familiar, so a straight 10 minutes walking directly into the darkness, but he reported the same thing – just nothing, endless flat plane and darkness. From their point, on the end of the 50ft rope in the middle of this yawning room, they started to feel… unnerved. They all quickly agreed to follow one of the walls as far as they could. So they took the right hand wall and started to follow it – they walked and walked for hours, no change. They even marked the wall with chalk to make sure they weren’t walking in circles. Nope – it just seemed to extend into nothingness. The frustration seemed to be growing, so they decided to camp.

**Camping** 

I knew camping in this dungeon would be surreal. Particularly in this room. There are no features, no horizon to watch, no rocks to climb to get overwatch. The only thing a sentry could do is sit and stare endlessly into the darkness. Which is what they did – they set watches and, in turn, each sentry sat for a straight two hours staring into the darkness of the room. 
Another feature of this place was a persistent mechanical pulse which reverberated throughout the structure every 15 seconds – not noticeable unless you were looking out for it, but in the darkness of the “night” each sentry noticed it more clearly. What was an indistinct “pulse” before, now they attended to it, gained a vocal quality. What was a “HHMMMMMMMM” gained an “LLLLLLLLLLL” sound, and when one of the players critted their perception check I vocalised it fully…. “HEEEELLLLLLLLL”. And it was coming… from in the darkness. 

In the “morning” they rose from their slumber and what I had hoped would happen, happened. Some players were convinced they need to strike out into the darkness, some players thought they needed to spelunk into the shaft in the previous chamber, others thought they should just try to find their way out. Inevitably, an argument broke out. All the frustration, disturbance, isolation, of the previous day boiled over. 

I let them bicker for a good 10minutes (in game bickering, by the way, they were actually quite enjoying it). Eventually the “strike out into the darkness” crew won, and they began to, with great trepidation, head out away from the safety of the walls. 

**Into the Darkness**

Within minutes they were away from eyesight of the walls, and walking on a featureless pitch-black plane. I described how they walked for hours in pitch blackness, with no change. Again, they argued if they should turn back, or try to find a way to teleport out, but for now they persisted. 
Nearing the end of the second day in the darkness, they were not looking forward to camping in this darkness. Curious, the rogue dropped a ball bearing and noticed how it hit the floor and began to roll.  The floor was, perhaps unperceptively gradated – and every few hours she did the same thing, and eventually she noticed how the gradient was become more severe the further they walked. 

**Into the Abyss**

This is where I took over. It was late (in real life) and we needed to finish. I described how they reached a point where the slope was noticeable to everyone, they’d been walking for the entire day and had no true idea which way was “back”, the only thing they knew is that moving forward, if this trend continued, they’d slip and then… they’d fall. So, this was the test – this was the point of the entire room – are they brave enough to slip and fall? 

They were. They agreed to continue, and when the first person lost their footing and began to slide, they went with it. And when that sliding stopped being simply sliding and they fell out into pitch blackness – I ended the session, with the entire party dropping silently into the abyss. And we’ll pick it up again in two weeks.",rpg,1581776954.0,0,12098,2162

My goal was to minimize early game woes by having to stop and explain rules en masse by having them read the book. That being said I can conclude that yes I was the asshole for canceling.

237,440,h93es4,"In a society where magic is present from the start, undead labor would likely be the norm, not the exception.","Assuming magic is relatively easy to learn, and a single necromancer can control a dozen or more skeletons, and a skeleton has high durability if not exposed to harm, I find highly likely that that would be the preferred form of labor.
Since the very start of life on Earth, obtaining food has been one of the most important (if not THE most important) driving forces towards progress, at an evolutionary and then societal level.
Now, imagine that to get food, all you had to do is animate some skeletons that have been lying around and order them to till the soil and plant seeds, at the cost of magical power. Settlements would form around fertile land as they have in our world, but society would center around necromancy, not phisical labour.
Populations would likely grow at a much slower rate, since there's less need for workers to feed the growing population.
Written language would be developed faster, because of the need to teach necromancy.
Necromancers would take most positions of leadership, and it's likely that religion would be centered on necromancy.
It would be seen not only as a force for good, but as the basis upon which the whole society is built on.
And that's only food - skeleton miners, woodcutters and any other form of labor that requires little decision making would be carried by undead workers, with humans keeping themselves to logistical functions, besides the necromancy.

Edit - Clarifying some points:
1. The preferred form of undead for most labor is the skeleton, because it lacks fleshy bits that rot and fall off. These skelies are animated by magic, not by binding spirits to them.
2. The morality of using undead would be defined by the societies that used them - which would likely see them in a positive light. Just think of all the daily atrocities being committed by the capitalist system that are simply taken as a normal part of life.",rpg,1592174316.0,0,1885,327
238,444,oui7rf,I hosted an RPG session for my parents. We ended after 25 minutes. They had fun though.,"_TLDR: I suggested playing RPGs to my parents during our vacation in the cabin. They never heard a word about RPGs, yet agreed to give it a try. Completely derailed from the story plot, yet they smiled afterwards, so I call it a success._

I play RPGs for years, mostly as DM. I also designed lots of small systems and yesterday I decided to present it to my parents. My SO was already asleep wit our kiddo, so it was only me and my parents sitting in the cabin, drinking wine and having a small talk. I wanted to avoid any kind of _high_ discussion (politics, neighbours, health, etc.) and as my dad doesn't like to play any games at all, I decided to present them roleplaying games. I wasn't putting any high hopes that they will actually say yes to that, yet they did and left me a little bit speechless. I was really pleasantly shocked and needed to make up a story for them.

I used my entrance-level homebrew system using a single 6-sided die, and prepared a low-fantasy setting story set in a small village that was preparing for a visit of a bishop. Every villager was participating, from the priest to the inkeeper, everybody was repairing their houses so they make good first impression.

My mum and dad were assigned roles of characters who immigrated few years ago, so they were already considered locals, yet with not very known past. My mum took a class of Knight and said that she was a sellsword in the past and my dad liked an idea of a monk focusing on a brewery (pretty interesting considering that my mother doesn't accept violence at all and my dad is 100 % abstinent for over 15 years). They were minding their business in front of the church when the priest opened the door and with the horror in his eyes told them that a blasphemy happened in the church.

They both walked inside, waiting for an explanation. A priest told them if they see something missing on the altar and they saw the giant cross is missing. _""Who would ever do that?!""_ the priest asked and the duo raised their shoulders. _""Could you, please, take a look for the church, while I try to look outside?""_ asked the priest and without waiting for their response disappeared outside, leaving them alone in the emptiness of the church.

As it was pretty late (IRL), I tried to be quite descriptive so they could spark their imagination. The knight decided to search the altar, to find anything else that could be missing. The roll was complete failure, so I told my mum that she really doesn't recall anything that she could ever saw earlier on the altar what could be missing right now. Then I turned to my dad, the monk, with raised eyebrows. He looked at me and with a stoic voice answered: _""Why should I bother to investigate some missing cross? I'm just a simple monk brewing a beer for our local community, we should call the militia to participate!""_ _""They seem to be pretty busy with other security-related preparations in your town,""_ I answered, but then my mum, ahem, a knight involved: _""Listen to this. I am going to the local carpenter and make it clear that we need new cross till tomorrow midday!""_ _""And I will try to finish my beer with my special ingredient to raise the diversion!""_ my dad joined the camouflage plan.

Let me say I am not used to railroad sessions and leave pretty much lots of space for players' creativity, but as I saw my ~players~ parents to derail completely, with a smile on my face I decided to end this intro. I asked them to roll so we can see how well they managed to fulfill their attempts. The monk failed miserably, so I interpreted it as he tried to make a new great beer flavor, but it was mediocre at best, but the knight succeeded largely. Therefore the carpenter provided an acceptable replacement of a cross before the bishop entered the city and the church was saved.

As usual, we had a small talk after the game ended. Mum & dad were confused why would anybody steal the cross, if there were certainly more valuable things to take. I suggested, maybe somebody wanted to profane the cross of the church, causing a big problems to the local people. They said _ah_ in unison and accepted that idea, but it was already too late and I ended the session by myself, so we decided to go to sleep. 

Still they joked about the session during this morning. My mum wanted to put something in the drawer, but the father was in her way, so she grumped: _move, monk!_

This goes both ways, a new GM with ""only 3 months of experience"" might have more knowledge about running an enjoyable game for a certain table than someone with ""40 years as a forever GM"".

It's great to be proud of playing games since you were 5 years old and considering that the start of your RPG experience but when it gets mentioned at the start of a reply all the time I simply roll my eyes, skim the advice and move on. The length of time you have been playing has very little bearing on whether or not your opinion is valid.

Everything is relative anyway. Your 12 year campaign that has seen players come and go with people you are already good friends with might not not be the best place to draw your conclusions from when someone asks about solving player buy-in problems with random strangers online for example.

There are so many different systems out there as well that your decade of experience running FATE might not hit the mark for someone looking for concrete examples to increase difficulty in their 5e game. Maybe it will, and announcing your expertise and familiarity with that system would give them a new perspective or something new to explore rather than simply acknowledging ""sage advice"" from someone who plays once a month with rotating GMs (""if we're lucky"").

There are so many factors and styles that I really don't see the point in quantifying how good of a GM you are or how much more valid your opinion is simply by however long you claim you've been GM.

243,451,6985rj,(Rant) I can almost guarantee I won't GM your combat-centric RPG if you don't offer this.,"A library of ready-made opponent stat blocks, **formatted for ease of play**.

* Your opponent stat blocks are in sprawling paragraph form in size 8 font? **Pass**.
* Your opponent stat blocks require me to cross reference to a huge library of powers, edges, or spells for rules text? **Pass**.

If you give me a choice between a monster book with 100 monsters in tight paragraph form with spell lists, or 75 monsters laid out nicely with critical stats highlighted and all ability text written out right in the stat block, I will take the latter every time.

Adding a monster/opponent to my session should be as simple as cracking the book and shouting, ""Roll for initiative!"" For all the complaints I had about D&D 4e, the one thing that edition did flawlessly was provide opponent information exactly as you'd want to see it in play, at the table.

Your opponent formatting isn't an afterthought. A stressed GM shouldn't have to retain the text of half a dozen spells or edges in-mind while trying to run an entertaining combat. They shouldn't have to spread sticky tabs through the manual to run all the rules widgets for one monster.

It boggles my mind that even some of today's most popular RPGs don't prioritize this.

D20 Conan had the same problem of linear fighter, exponential mage, that many D20 games (especially of the time) have. They came up with a very interesting, very thematic, solution.

To level up in the Scholar (caster) class one must succeed at some sort of check (the details escape me). It starts easy but gets harder with each level. The check is basically to see if you have in your travels uncovered some sort of inspiration to unlock the deeper mysteries of magic. IIRC it can be made easier by finding ancient spellbooks and the like. If you fail the check you reset your xp to the start of your current level. No level up for you, sorry.

""I know, it is *profoundly* unfair, but that's the way the rule is written, my hands are tied. All your friends are growing stronger, and you are left behind. You could always just abandon the path of magic next time you level, pick something easier... no?

Tell me more about how you worked hard for this new level. Tell me more about how you *deserve* it. Tell me more about how you *need* it to help your friends with the monsters they will surely face in the next adventure. Tell me about how much you were looking forward to, how much you *want* the *powers* the next level will bring. Tell me all your *frustrations and anger* about not being able to advance with the others.

It turns out... there is another way. A... creature, I do so hate the word ""demon,"" from another plane of existence whispers to you in your dreams.

It is true that in times of great stress or temptation I'll ask you to make a save against corruption. And if you fail one of these checks you turn to stage-villain evil, cackle off into the night and start a cult in a mountain of power.

And though I didn't mean for the two versions to drift apart, they did a bit. This morning I updated the swear version to more closely resemble the clean version. Though there are still a couple tiny differences because, like I said, less room when you swear a lot.

Some time ago I came across HERE'S SOME FUCKIN' D&D, a micro RPG that's been floating around the internet for a number of years. In fact, [here's a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4066um/heres_some_fuckin_dd/) on Reddit about it from three years ago. I've run it a ton of times at bars, barbeques, picnics, and camping and I'm such a huge fan that I redid it and I'm releasing that effort to you all.

**The Story:** I love gaming at bars and micro RPGs work well in that setting. Unfortunately, I never really found a micro RPG that had the crunch vs. simplicity mix just right. Then a few years ago I came across HSFD&D, which comes *suuuper* close to the mix I want—but it had a few issues that bugged me. So I rebuilt the fucker in InDesign and fixed the shit that bugged me.

It's a *complete* overhaul of the original: I reordered and reworded things for better reference, rebalanced things (bards and halflings sucked in the original), used the original fonts from AD&D, made it so spellcasters could pick their own spells, redid the spells from the ground up using the same language style, added monster creation, monster examples, some magic items, hirelings, and then rounded the whole thing out with some random tables.

Also included is a clean version with all of the swears removed: perfect for teaching young children or priests. Put a copy of it inside a pencil box with some index cards, golf pencils, and dice and you have an RPG you can take anywhere.

251,468,xgpqaq,Looking to switch from 5e? Shadow of the Demon Lord does everything better. Here are the differences:,"Note: SotDL was written by one of the lead designers of 5e who felt that calling something “D&D” came with expectations, and therefore limited innovation. So, he made his own game!

1. Shadow of the Demon Lord’s rules are much more streamlined, while also allowing for more meaningful player choices. The big examples are listed below, but there’s tons of small quality of life changes you’ll find as you read through the rules.

2. The class system is far more customizable and easily the most exciting part of the system. 
    * You choose a novice path at level 1, an expert path at level 3, and a master path at level 7. 
    * The paths are all relatively balanced and have no prerequisites. So you could start as a rogue, but decide it makes sense for your character to branch into magic, and it would be viable.
    * There are tens of thousands of combinations in the core rulebook. (Tens of millions when you include all the additional content, seriously)
     * Instead of planning out your entire level progression on day 1 (and therefore ruining any meaningful choices later down the line), this system actively encourages choosing your build *as you define your character.*

3. Combat is way more interesting than just martials swinging their sword over and over and casters using the same spells over and over.
    * Martial characters get a shit ton of available maneuvers right off the bat, about as much as 5e’s battle master.
    * Casters get castings per spell instead of spell slots, so they can’t use the same spell over and over again. Instead, they’ll have to be creative and use their whole arsenal.

4. There are hundreds more spells in SotDL than in 5e, yet choosing spells is less overwhelming because of how they are categorized.
     * There are 30 spell traditions in the core rulebook. When you learn a new tradition, you are presented with a digestible amount of spells in the tradition that you can choose from. 

5. The system excels in fewer, but more dramatic combats, not like 5e where the system encourages having filler battles.

6. The initiative system is fast and innovative, but also adds another layer of thoughtfulness. 
    * Each round, players choose between taking a fast turn and a slow turn.
 Combat order goes: player fast turns -> monster fast turns -> player slow turns -> monster slow turns.
    * If you take a fast turn, you can either act or move, but not both.
    * If you take a slow turn, you can both act and move.
    * When you have dynamic battlefields where players have to constantly be moving and a GM who skips players if they take too long to decide what to do, this initiative variant truly shines in all it’s beautiful elegance.

7. Ability scores have been reworked to make more sense. 
    * The scores are now Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Willpower.
    * It’s incredibly easy to determine what actions/saving throws belong to which score. (Don’t tell me you understood the difference between wisdom and charisma saving throws!)

8. The boons/banes mechanic is more versatile than advantage/disadvantage and allows for stacking buffs/debuffs in a way that isn’t overpowering.
    * When you have a boon on a roll, you add a d6 to your d20. When you have a bane on a roll, you subtract a d6 from your d20.
    * When you have multiple boons/banes, you roll multiple dice and only use the highest result to add/subtract. 
    * Because of this mechanic, we can have things like crazy combat maneuvers while still accounting for their varying complexities.
    * Boons and banes also cancel each other out on a 1-1 basis. So if you have 2 boons and are attempting a 3 bane maneuver, overall it counts as 1 bane.

9. Instead of keeping track of a million little skill modifiers to represent your talents, you simply write down a profession from your characters background. Then, whenever that profession is relevant, you get a boon to your roll.
    * I could go on and on about how skill lists limit player options and creativity (especially since so many players treat the skill list as a verb list), but here, we have an elegant solution that *encourages* player creativity.

10. The corruption and insanity mechanics are great and can make for genuinely terrifying moments, but they can also easily be removed for a more lighthearted game.
    * Additionally, the paths/spells that actively corrupt you / make you insane are thematically awesome.

11. Character creation is lightning fast. You choose your ancestry and professions, roll for equipment, and then you’re good to go!
    * I don’t think people always realize how important fast character creation is. When I show up to play an RPG, I want to actually *play* the RPG, not wait until the next week.

12. (Ok, this point isn’t related to 5e but I wanted to mention it in case people were concerned.) As far as lore goes, it’s purposefully light and flexible so that GMs have full reign to make the world their own.
    * Or, you can use a completely different setting with pretty much no hassle. The mechanics are not tied to the initial setting.
    * But if you really like SotDL’s lore and want more, plenty of supplements exist that flesh out areas for you.
    * It’s a win no matter what type of GM you are.

So there you have it, I believe that Shadow of the Demon Lord does 5e better than 5e. You can get a free starter guide [here](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/156576), it’s everything you need to play at level 0.

Thanks!

\---

Moral “alignment” is a common trope in RPGs, be it fantasy or otherwise. The most simple presentation being a choice between good and evil with stoic neutrality in between the two extremes. Another axis - like adherence to the rule of law versus spontaneous chaos - was added to make characters more two-dimensional. Not all characters needed to be hand-wringing evildoers or cat saving boy scouts.

Although, even with the two-track approach, options are limited. The other problem with this type of black and white morality is that it doesn’t speak to *why* a character is “good” or “evil”. **Master of the Rogue Spire** presents a more piecemeal approach to personality generation for players and Game Masters. Those familiar with the traditional nine alignments will be able to find some overlap in the new system, but there is much more room for customization and experimentation in your character’s Personality Traits.

## PERSONALITY TRAITS

When deciding a character’s personality, players and Game Masters should think of what motivates their character into action or inaction. Below, **Chart 5.1** shows the relationship of the 10 general personality traits. They form a circular pattern from altruistic motivations to dominant motivations and back around again. Altruistic characters take action selflessly, while dominant characters focus more on what they can gain from each situation.

One the left side of the Personality Wheel are personalities focused on individual action while the right side is more motivated by social structure. Traditionally, this was called the axis of chaos versus law, but while chaos implies randomness, those motivated by their individual wants may be very focused and organized.

[Chart 5.1: The Personality Wheel](https://i.imgur.com/XvE42ym.png)

## CHOOSING TRAITS

Characters can have up to four different personality traits, but most have only one or two. After choosing an initial trait, remove all opposing traits - these are traits more than three spaces away on the Personality Wheel. Opposing traits may be admissible by your Game Master, but **a character cannot have two diametrically opposing traits** as they stand for the exact opposite motivation. These diametrically opposing traits are highlighted in *italics* in the Trait descriptions.

Characters can be motivated by something other than what their Personality Traits dictate, but the traits should take precedence in any important decisions that have real repercussions in your game world.

>**RANDOM TRAITS FOR NPCs**If a player or the Game Master wants to quickly determine traits, they may roll for 1-4 random traits for each character:

1. Roll 4d10 and place them in a row.2. Record the Trait selected by the first die number.3. Remove all dice with opposing Trait numbers.4. Remove the first die. If any dice remain, go to step 2.5. Repeat until no dice remain.

## ENCOURAGING ACTIONS

Game Masters should keep track of a player’s traits and have them available during gameplay. If a player is making a tough choice with two wildly different outcomes, there are benefits they can be given for choosing the outcome that coincides with their character’s motivations. At the appropriate decision point, adjudicated by the Game Master, they may gain the Encouraged status. This can be a personal decision or a decision that the entire party makes. In the case of a party decision, the Game Master may give multiple characters the Encouraged status for the same action.

A Selfless character could be encouraged if he stayed an extra day in town to heal the sick even though a storm is coming, an Independent character could be encouraged to disobey the direct orders of his leader because he saw an interesting shop on the street, or an Imperious character could be encouraged by forcing his way into a leadership role in his gang over someone that better deserved it. Characters need to make an actual choice to receive the Encouraged status, which usually means facing some repercussions.

If a player already has the Encouraged status, they may choose to spend the new Encouraged status at that moment or lose it forever. If a player has the Discouraged status they remove it instead of gaining the Encouraged status, or if applicable, downgrade Stressed to Discouraged or downgrade Overwhelmed to Stressed.

## DISCOURAGING ACTIONS

When players go against their character’s motivations, the Game Master may give their character the Discouraged status to represent the regret they are feeling. Characters can also be affected negatively by the actions of the other members of their party. If someone in their party makes a decision that is diametrically opposed to their personal beliefs, the Game Master may give the Discouraged status to any characters that were aware of the action happening and could have stopped it. If a character has the Discouraged status, they upgrade it to the Stressed status, and if they already have the Stressed status they upgrade it to the Overwhelmed status.

>\*\*DEGRADING STATUS ORDER:\*\*DISCOURAGED -> STRESSED -> OVERWHELMED  
>  
>More information will be provided in later content.

A Dogmatic character would be Discouraged when another party member steals from the inn where they are staying, a humane character would be Discouraged when another party member tortures a captive orc, or a Righteous character would be Discouraged when the party decides not to intervene when the town is being unfairly punished by their leaders. A Game Master cannot bar a player from taking an action opposed to their Personality Traits, but players that continue to take Discouraging actions should be allowed to change their character’s Personality Traits.

## NPC REACTIONS

NPCs that already have the Discouraged or Stressed status will refuse to take another action against their beliefs and can be further discouraged by the actions of their group if their happiness is not managed. NPCs that have the Overwhelmed status will immediately leave the party if they deem it safe to do so. Once they have left the party, they will not return without some intervention from the players to explain their actions or how they have changed.

## CHANGING TRAITS

Changing Personality Traits should not be done on a whim, but if a player is consistently being discouraged by their own actions or by their party, they may petition the Game Master to change their traits. If done in the first few sessions of play, there should be no problems switching out traits - the purpose of the traits is to give the players a basis for their role-playing decisions and reduce table arguments over character motivations, not to punish players for trying to refine their character's personality during play.

If a penalty for changing traits is needed to reduce players taking advantage of the Personality Trait system, Game Masters may give the Discouraged, Stressed or Overwhelmed status to characters that change Personality too drastically or too often. They may also bar a character from getting XP for the next session to represent the stress of their character's emotional upheaval.

## TRAIT DESCRIPTIONS

## 1. CRUEL

**Motivation:** Malice

**Motto:** “Show no mercy”

**Opposing Traits:** (6) *Humane,* (7) Selfless, (5) Principled 

Cruel characters take great pleasure in hurting or dominating others, especially their enemies. They may extract a steep penalty for any wrongdoing or serve a cruel master, but they aren’t concerned about helping anyone or progressing the greater good through their cruelty.

* They want to hurt others.
* They would only show mercy to inflict more pain.

## 2. IMPERIOUS

**Motivation:** Power

**Motto:** “Might makes right”

**Opposing Traits:** (7) *Selfless,* (8) Righteous, (6) Humane

Imperious characters wish to take power over others and feel no need to help other characters whether they are in trouble or not.

* They want to dominate others.
* They would only help someone to gain power over them.

## 3. DOGMATIC

**Opposing Traits:** (8) *Righteous,* (9) Independent, (7) Selfless

Dogmatic characters follow the law to the letter, whether it be the law of the land or their religion or their group’s ethos, but never their own personal whims. They may be ambitious for status and wealth or kind to the unfortunate but they do not seek out independence in action or desire to give their life in service.

* They want to follow the rules.
* They would only do what is right if the law allows it.

## 4. OBEDIENT

**Motivation:** Duty

**Motto:** “Just following orders”

**Opposing Traits:** (9) *Independent,* (8) Righteous, (10) Ambitious

Obedient characters follow the orders of their commanders, whether they be good, evil, legal or illegal. They may serve selflessly or as an extension of their personal cruelty, but they aren’t concerned with their personal ambitions or what is the just course of action in any situation.

* They want to serve their leader well.
* They would only do what they want if their leader allows it.

## 5. PRINCIPLED

**Motivation:** Unity

**Motto:** “For the greater good”

**Opposing Traits:** (10) *Ambitious,* (9) Independent, (1) Cruel

Principled characters try to do the best for all, even if would cause suffering for some - some would call it the pragmatic side of good. They may try to consolidate power around themselves to do this or have their own sense of right and wrong, but they not driven by selfish or cruel motivations.

* They want to make the world a better place.
* They would only act for themselves if society would benefit.

## 6. HUMANE

**Motivation:** Altruism

**Motto:** “Kindness is never wasted”

**Opposing Traits:** (1) *Cruel*, (10) Ambitious, (2) Imperious

Human characters are always kind and never cruel, even to their enemies. Their kindness does not have an agenda. They may take personal joy from kindness or it may be part of a deeply held belief system, but they don’t care about status, competition, or hierarchical dominance.

* They want to be good to others.
* They would only hurt someone if it can not be avoided.

## 7. SELFLESS

**Motivation:** Service

**Motto:** “Living is service to others”

**Opposing Traits:** (2) *Imperious*, (1) Cruel, (3) Dogmatic

Selfless characters live in service to helping others even if it may be detrimental to themselves. They are independent agents serving causes that they believe to be just and good. They may blindly follow the orders of a just leader or seek to gain prestige and fame for their service, but they don’t enjoy cruelty or following rules they believe to be unjust.

* They want to serve the cause.
* They would only take power over another to save them.

## 8. RIGHTEOUS

**Motivation:** Justice

**Motto:** “More justice, less law""

**Opposing Traits:** (3) *Dogmatic*, (2) Imperious, (4) Obedient

Righteous characters do what they think is fair and just and are not concerned with what the law says they can or cannot do. They may fight for the greater good or enjoy handing out cruel punishments, but they are not interested in power for power’s sake or following their leaders blindly.

* They want to right wrongs.
* They would only follow the law if they agreed it was just.

## 9. INDEPENDENT

**Motivation:** Freedom

**Motto:** “Live in the moment”

**Opposing Traits:** (4) *Obedient*, (3) Dogmatic, (5) Principled

Independent characters do what they want to do and are not concerned about what others think. They may thirst for power or do good for others, but they care nothing for the rules of society or a nebulous sense of the “the greater good.”

* They want to enjoy life.
* They would only follow orders that they wanted to follow.

## 10. AMBITIOUS

**Motivation:** Achievement

**Motto:** “First come, first serve”

**Opposing Traits:** (5) *Principled*, (4) Obedient, (6) Humane

Ambitious characters want to be the best, the richest, the most loved or if they cannot be any of those, simply be most famous. They may get there while slavishly following the rules or through heroic self-sacrifice, but they are not concerned with being nice or following the will of others.

* They want to improve their holdings and status.
* They would only help others if it helped them personally.

What happened next? Eight hours spent making (completely wrong I'm sure) a wood elf ranger named Arenoth. Thanking God I bought that 1970 Firebird from my brother’s ex-girlfriend after it had been totaled. It should have been able to make it 12 miles to the kid’s house.

What didn’t happen next? The session. A father’s business trip. A sister's cheer tournament. Some of the other players decided it was easier to play Super Mario Brothers than to figure out a ride. Whatever it was, the session didn’t happen.

What did I do? I went back to running WEG Star Wars for my friends and GMed everything for the next 20 some years until one of my players finally decided to run a game (after non-stop begging from me).

The hot take here is that it was easier back in the day when the glories of the OSR were blooming like the fresh flowers of spring to run games, so we had more DMs. Not true.

When a session began at the entrance to a dungeon, and there was no outside world and characters were easy to make and had no backstories, still hardly anyone wanted to the DM.

Why, you say, why? Because it's more work than being a player. The DM needed monsters, and room items. They needed dungeon maps. They needed to know the rules because the players didn't own the books (or had never heard of an RPG before) and couldn't look them up online. Plus only one of the players actually wanted to play. The other three people were strongarmed into playing by the DM filled with dreams wafting from the pages of Dragon magazine of mythical things called campaigns.

You see, there's always been a GM shortage. It is just the nature of the hobby. Being GM or DM takes more work than being a player, so fewer want to do it. Though, it doesn't take as much work as some would like to say it does.

But it's gotten worse for DMs since then. Now, we place so much pressure on the GM that is a surprise anyone wants to run a game. Just look around the web.

Bad game mastering turns off players. GMs have to cater to every whim of the players. GMs have to know every single rule. If they don't know how to run mounted combat they've failed and should be cast into the lake of fire. GMs need to spend hours each week planning sessions. GMs need to write epic campaigns the likes of Tolkien or Shakespeare couldn't produce. Bad D&D is worse than no D&D.

Lies, lies, all lies from the pit of the nine hells. Hot take: If you want your DM to be Shakespeare, you had better be Michael Caine, Patrick Stewart, or Maggie Smith.

However, there is another truth at the heart of the matter. While there is a GM shortage, and there always will be, there are currently more game masters than ever before.

In the last seven years, I have only GMed when I wanted to. All of the players in my group now regularly run D&D or another game for our group and even for other groups. The popularity of 5e caused more people than ever to take up the mantle of the dungeon master. Hop on Roll20 any day or time and you can be in a D&D session in less than 15 minutes.

We should stop complaining and realize we are in the Second Golden Age of RPGs. More people are playing and running than ever before in history. Let that sink in, and think about what it means for the future of the hobby.

Soon D&D will go into a downturn like all the cycles of the past. The players 5e brought in will play other RPGs, and the hobby will move a little less mainstream until D&D makes another resurgence. But the end result will be a thriving hobby with many more people willing to run games.

Let's encourage new role-players to run sessions, not berate them if they don't know a rule. Let's encourage players to learn how their characters work and to be active and helpful.",rpg,1672863899.0,0,4481,799
269,498,kd1nnw,"Please, give your GM a break.","Sorry if this  is kind of ranty, but I have to get this off my chest.

I have been playing Table Top RPGs for close to 20 years and primarily GM a number of different systems. I ran our normal online 5e session with our normal group and a newcomer that a player invited with my approval. Last session was the first time in my entire GMing career in which I had a player (the new one) treat me and the session like a ""commodity"", ""product"" or ""transaction"" as opposed to a collection of friends enjoying each other's company and playing a game. As a GM, I failed  to meet this player's unstated expectations, norms, and sensibilities which I read all about in a rejection letter of de-constructive criticisms.

I am not upset that this player doesn't want to play our game. Part of the beauty of Table Top RPGs is that there are so many different systems, styles of play, optional rules, homebrew rules, tones, and themes. There is a game out there for everyone, though it may be difficult to find. I totally get it, this wasn't the type of game for this player and have had players back out many times in the past. What bothers me was that in running my normal campaign, I was made to feel as though I failed this player. I was made to feel that I didn't provide the product which I advertised despite never meeting this player before. I wasn't treated as a person that has my own interests and makes my own mistakes or misjudgements, but a means to an ends. The ends, in this case, being some nebulous version of ""fun"".

So please, if you are a player who is sitting in on a game that isn't fun or has problems, by all means bring it to the attention to the GM and even back out of the group if you want. But please remember, your GM is a person with their own schedules, limitations, anxieties, insecurities, interests, and methods of doing things. The GM isn't always in control of the campaign or session (which can be a ton of fun, but can be a nightmare), or the GM can be experimenting with some ideas, or the GM can be having an off day. Please don't take it personally. Your GM probably isn't trying to keep you from having a less than stellar time. But don't be cruel just because an itch wasn't scratched (especially if you didn't make that itch known). If you are at a table and find yourself not having a blast, try to enjoy the company of the people playing around you (to include the GM). Nobody at the table exists to ensure that you have fun. It is OK to just play the game to melt away a few hours but enjoy being with friends or potential new friends.

So please, give your GM a break. They may be a narrator in what has to be the most complected genera of board games ever, but they are still very much a human being at a table.

&#x200B;

EDIT & UPDATE

Wow, this blew up a bit bigger than I expected. I cant say enough how thankful for all your encouragement and input. Honestly, I am thrilled with how healthy the tabletop community can actually be and it was nice to be reminded of that. I wanted to respond to everyone, but sadly, work today is turning out to be a bit busier than a typical Monday. Addtionally, people have been wanting to know what happened specifically, when I would be willing to post, but don't really have time right now. I am open to doing so later. 

I must admit, I was kind of vague about details because I don't really want the discussion to turn to, ""you did this wrong,"" or ""next time do this."" I recognize that there were strengths and weaknesses of my last session. I have been experiments a bit more when I play 5e lately, so I fully acknowledge that I made some mistakes and I totally own them. My overall message is that it is OK for a GM to make mistakes, have a bad session, or do things you don't like as a player. As a player, you should communicate your concerns and even quite the campaign, but not be petty, rude, or de-constructive with your criticism. 

That being said, I would be open to telling the full story because I do think it can be something that players and GMs can learn from. So hopefully I will get time later. 

In the meantime, here are some key takeaways. 

For players. GMing is a difficult job and which is made even more stressful because their isn't a right way to do it. Sure, GMs can get overly defensive, but a lot of GMs put a lot of themselves out there. This is very often true when you are having a blast, but also true when you aren't feeling it. By all means, be critical, but make sure your criticism is fair, tactful, and constructive. Also, please be open to an explanation for why a GM may have made the decisions that they did and be willing to be part of the solution. I misread players all the time. This can be even more difficult with role-playing since the actions and attitudes of the character may not match up with those of the payer. So please, be mindful that the GM is probably trying everything they can to run a fun and rewarding experience. Please be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and to give them a break. 

For GMs, especially new GMs. You can be doing this hobby for 20 years and still make mistakes and not have all the answers. I am nervous before every session, without fail. Additionally, even after 20 years you can be still trying to improve your skills and become a better GM. Lately I have been racking my brain on how to better introduce and run villains and I agonize how to pace a session, especially an online session. Not being able to read the room makes it so hard to pace a session and get it to move smoothly. With all this in mind, if you are a GM, be open to feedback (both positive and negative, so long as it is respectful) and be willing to give yourself a break. You should be having fun too. 

For everyone. You are sitting down to play a game with acquaintances, friends, or potential friends. My group is made up of players from all over the world and it is an amazing opportunity to learn about other people, their views, and their experiences. Even if you aren't having a great time GMing or playing, try and cherish the opportunity to totally lose track of time by just having a silly conversation about the lifestyles of elves and gnomes.

270,499,3x3p7g,The Best Advice I've Ever Gotten for Running Games,"One of the handiest tips I've come across for DMing games is something I like to call ""The Four Whats"" though it has an optional 5th one for linking quests. Essentially, when you are making a quest you apply these 4-5 questions to the base concept (""go kill goblins"", ""find the orb"", etc). Not only can it help you check for plot holes; but it can turn mundane side quests into fully fleshed out ones with little effort. The optional 5th one can even aid in creating an entire campaign if an earlier one didn't do it.


The Four Whats:

- What are the quest giver's motivations?
- What are the bad guy's motivations?
- What are the quest giver's sources for his information?
- What reason would the players have to accept the quest?


Optional 5th: What are the sources for the bad guys' information?


For example, let's run a simple quest through this: ""Bart wants you to go to this cave and kill some zombies.""


- Bart is a paladin that crusades against undead.
- The zombies are there because a necromancer found a powerful necrotic wand there and set up a base there.
- Bart knows about the zombies there because he was defeated and badly wounded trying to stop them.
- He will pay them, and helping a paladin might put them in good with his order.
- Optionally, the necromancer may have heard tale of the wand from a local bard... but where did that person hear of it? Plot thread!


With ease the process turned a mundane quest of a generic person sending you to kill generic enemies into a quest to redeem the honor of a defeated paladin and stop a necromancer from using a fell wand to threaten the nearby town. Two possibly recurring NPCs (ally and villain) plus a bit of loot or plot macguffin were also introduced, with the fifth what giving another thread to follow up with.


Post applying these I also like adding four secrets to discover. Either hidden loot or just interesting baubles or bits of the past. Let's add these to the example for seasoning.


Four Secrets:

- One of the zombies has a key to something that is elsewhere.
- In a side passage two lovers have been slain who were hiding there until nightfall so they could flee town. Seems they were killed before the necromancer got there.
- In a pool of water the party finds some gold dust.
- The necromancer dropped his pocket watch in a side room. On it is an engraving that hints that he was once very different, but the party may not figure out it is the necromancer's.


And there we have it. Quite the fleshed out quest from basically nothing and pretty easily done. Though this might be an obvious process for some I just thought I'd share it for those it might help.",rpg,1450287346.0,0,2653,488

1. **Character's Name** - something appropriate to a small midwestern town ca. 1953 [or whatever setting - that was just my mood that day]
2. **Role In Town** - What the person does from day to day, be it  a job, a cliche, or whatever
3. **A Brief Description** - Just a few words about the character's personality, background, what have you.
4. **Dramatic Question** - An open-ended question that suggests a mystery to solve, a conflict to play out, or a secret to discover

Obsessive collector of old and obscure books; particularly of histories, and atlases.  •Only in his early 40s, but seems much much older, as if time had worn harder on him, prompting many to wonder if they know his real age. Pays his workers well, but has unusual business habits. Why did he unexpectedly close his most productive mine, build a heavy locked door and barricade across the entrance, and then move all the miners to multiple less viable shafts?

>Emerson Rankins. He works as a private accountant, mostly doing taxes for folks around town. He showed up 4 years ago and moved into the abandoned Rankins house behind Zip's.

277,511,ejjgtp,"I'm a bit sick of the false dichotomy of ""combat vs RP"".","Now, this is not to say that combat can't be a drag or that it can't be completely disengaged from the story. It can, and, most of the time it is.

But here's the kicker.

That's the DM's fault, that's OUR fault, (and, in part, the Three Pillar's fault, but we'll get to that).

Now, what do I mean by it's our fault? Well, let's take a step back.

Raise you hand if you've ever seen Star Wars, Episode I and Star Wars, Episode IV. Now, people always blab on about how Episode I is boring (it is) and Episode IV being the shit (which it is). But, compare the action between the two of them. Which one has more action? Episode I. Then, why is it that the movie with less action is, in this apparent paradox, more entertaining?

Well, if this was an RPG, we would be quick to say,  ""See?! Combat is boring! Give me a non-combat RPG any day!"". But that I'm here to make the case that this reasoning is completely flawed. The problem, the issue, lies elswhere.

The issue, my friends, [as a famous serial killer, kidnapper and reviewer extraordinaire once said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHUj90XDYE0), is that you don't give a shit to what happens to Qui Gon, Amidala and all the other clowns. You don't care about them or that planet, or who the fuck Darth Maul is because you, as an audience, doesn't know them, and, more importantly, *the characters, the actual characters in the story, don't interact with Maul other than to fight him*. Yeah, the visuals in the scene are ok, the choreography is good, but, ultimately, the scene leaves you... eh... alright, they killed the BBEG of the week, but... what about it?

Compare to what happens in Episode IV. The lightsaber fight there is between an actor who, at the time of recording, was in his 60's and a guy in a rubber suit that could barely move and much less see. But that fight bears more significance, more emotional charge than two guys fighting a double-bladed lightsaber in a reactor core while flashing lights are going on.

Now, You could still say ""hey, right, but, then you need to take time away from action to invest in the characters, see? Less combat is good.""

Now, pump your brakes, kids, we're not finished with Star Wars.

Episode VI.

Episode VI is almost pure action. Starts with a failed heist, an action scene in the desert. In the end, we have, at the same time, a Battle in the woods, a space clash and a fight between father and son, all culminating in a space station 160 km wide being destroyed, the carebears defeating the empire and Darth Vader YEETing emperor palpatine out the goddam window, with luke helping him escape. There is some interaction inbetween scenes, yes, and there are some powerful scenes in those interactions, but the action scenes are the most memorable. Now, again, we cared about those people involved in the fight, and we cared about the outcome of those, we understood what was at stake, so we were invested.

Now, let's go back to RPGs in general. Let's focus of a typical culprit of ""combat is boring"". Let's take a look at D&D/Pathfinder.

*So, you guys have entered the jungle plains of Galgathor, in search for the fabled ruins of the Dragon City of Valnaxar. You fo to sleep at night \*DM Rolls dice, looks at random encounter table for his humid jungle CR5 list\* and you are attacked by a group of... uh... giant... centipedes. Ok, roll initiative.*

Now, does that sound entertaining? Well, mechanically, maybe, if the DM knows how to handle a multitudinous enemy, and if, maybe, the ranger can use his favored terrain/favored enemy, and clumped enemies means more opportunities for AoE attacks from the wizard. Neato, right?

But, what does this fight tell us about the mission, the plot, the characters, the country? Anything? Will the characters be the same after this fight? Will the mission have advanced? Would it have been any different the morning after if the characters hadn't fought at all? No, not at all. Then, why have the fight there? Why not postpone the battle until there is something interesting, or something that is relevant? 

Consider the same example, characters exploring a city, and a large group of CR 1/2 enemies. Ok, but now, let's make it kobolds (more fitting, kobolds, dragons, you know), and now, let's make it so that some of them are wearing an oversized piece of armor or weaponry with the emblem of Quixulan, the ruling noble house of Valnaxar. Shit, suddenly, those kobolds tell us something about this country, about Valnaxar, about the mission. Now, let's make it so that they are speaking in draconian, and they are saying things like ""Death to the invaders! Let the earth of Valnaxar feast upon the blood of the unworthy!"" Now, they may not know draconian, but they might recognize Valnaxar amongst what they are saying.

Ok, so, in the previous example, it was all flavor, and that's a good starting point, but now, let's do something CRA-ZY, let's involve the *mechanichs* into the *storytelling*. We have a conflict here, which is the prime material for drama, or RP, as we call it, and yes, we don't know much about these kobolds, but the characterse might want to know more. ""Where did they get their armor and weapons? How did they find out about Valnaxar? Are they original residents that just endured over time or are they new inhabitants?"" To answer these questions, the players have a number of options: they can capture one alive and see what they can gather from him. They might want to route them, and then follow them through the jungle, or they might just kill them and follow their trails back from where they came, or a myriad of other things that they might think of.

Now, how do we involve the mechanics in the RP? Well, if they want to capture one, maybe the kobolds know this, and, like many people, know that if they are captured, a fate worse than death might await them, or that a comrade captured puts the location of the city at risk, so instead, they outright kill themselves/their companions before being captured. This might not need a new outlandish thing, but a simple drank poison, or the other kobolds attacking their fallen brethren until they are sure it's dead. And about their combat tactics, kobolds are a great example of how combat can define a character or a society, how the RP, the worldbuilding, can inform the mechanics, and vice-versa. Kobolds are small and fragile, that's why, against a group of adventurers, they will probably use guerilla tactics, specially when they know the terrain, and the party doesn't.

Now, let's take this characterization of combat a bit further. Consider another scenario. The typical bandit/thief attack in the middle of a city. Tried, grinded, boring. Yes, I admit it. Why? It's a bunch of low-level npcs that pose no threat to the party whatsoever. It's an opportunity to roll some dice at best, a nuisance at wrost.

Now, remember when I talked about star wars. Remember I said that all fights had meaning, because we cared about the results and the characters. Does that mean we cared about the rancor? Well, certainly not, but we cared about Luke making it out alive of that pit, and, more importantly, we bought that a guy like Jabba the Hutt would have a Rancor-Pit-Of-Death right under his throne, because he's a slimy guy like that.

So, with that in mind, let's take the previous bandit attack on a city^(TM) and let's turn it into something interesting. Let's say the BBEG that they guys are following is a secretive wizard, that has been plotting in the dark, and no-one know its true identity. They don't even know their true motivations. But they have a lead on a guy that might now something about someone who might know this wizard. It's a far-fetched thing, but, hey, it's a lead. So they go visit him, an interaction ensues, and the bloke flees the scene, leaving his low-level henchmen behind as he makes a run for it.

Notice, his low-level henchmen are, exactly, the same low-level henchmen as before, they are going to die as easily as before, perhaps 3-4 turns tops. Problem is, now there is a rush, because the more time they spend with these bozos, the more time the lead has to escape. Now, the monk might make a run for it, but it will also mean that he's alone, against him, and that guy might not want anything to do with a party of 5 adventurers, but he might be experienced enough to take this one guy out, specially if he has a backup group waiting for him. The fighter and the rogue might not spend as much time flanking and sneak attacking if they have to rush it, etc.

And as such, there are plenty of examples, Why did the usually calm and protective paladin NPC? rush through enemies, risking attacks of opportunity, when she saw that particular guy behind the enemy lines? Why does the Toreador primogen have Protean claws? etc.

tl;dr: What I'm getting as with such a long post is that combat and RP aren't mutually exclusive, but rather, they stand in a dialectical relationship. One informs the other, and vice versa. Combat can BE RP.",rpg,1578076158.0,0,9020,1593

279,514,6us2fp,A Eulogy for My Group,"*TL;DR: I had an amazing gaming group and I want to offer remembrance for them.*

**The backstory:** I am a Franciscan friar -- meaning Roman Catholic, I live like a monk but instead of being in a single monastery for my whole life, I move around.  I'm now moving from one friary into another. At my last friary, three of us friars would gather at least weekly for a role-playing game (a homebrewed Tunnels and Trolls campaign, for the curious).  I'd frequent various Reddit subs for advice.  It wasn't until this week, where I attended my first Adventurer's League game at a game shop, that I realized just how special my group was, which has inspired me to immortalize my group by sharing with this sub the joys that we had.

**The game:** Living in a friary is literally the BEST place to do role-playing. It's an entire house filled with multiclassed cleric-monks. We're already walking around wearing robes, looking like it's the Middle Ages, plus we've got access to everything from the church -- candles, incense, ancient-looking books. Hence, when we did our games, we went all-freaking-out.  

We were all new to tabletop role-playing, but we got into our characters and soon an elven wizard looking to bring his friend from the dead had struck an uneasy and eventually trusting friendship with a thieving fairy, and the adventures were on! Among my favorite moments were the following:

* The introduction of an NPC panther to the party, who could communicate to the others by changing his color (later revealed to have been a wizard who stayed polymorphed too long and only had that  one last transmutation trick left).

* The taming of a warg -- it took a long time, but once tamed, the elf rode the warg and the fairy rode the panther.

* A pair of bounty hunters, who, rather than being killed, were beaten into submission, tied to a tree, and forcibly sent on a vision quest using psychedelic mushrooms and poetry to the wizard's deity.

* Sneaking around a mansion, trying to go undetected using fly and invisibility spells, with both running out at exactly the most tense moment.

**The extras:** The game itself was great, but only half the fun. Our environment kicked ass. We had music, atmospheric lighting, location-appropriate decorations (including ashes and bones when they were clearing out an undead-infested temple), and even used homemade incense when receiving oracles from a visionary witch. And here, check out our [game board.](http://i.imgur.com/WoFpRmZ.jpg) Those candles are homemade jar candles with wax melted down from old altar candles. The red bottle in the front left? That's a home-made health potion (drink it whenever your character does.) It was a guava/hibiscus/paprika potion, and the color was on-freaking-point.

Oh, and the food. We took our Saturday afternoons to prepare for the evening's game session. We're talking homemade curries, quiches, cheesecakes, cheese plates -- we even had bacon-wrapped dates once! And those bottles towards the back of the picture were soda water which we'd mix with homemade syrups to make homemade sodas when we didn't have a beer or wine handy. Every week was a new and unique drink. Ever tried white chocolate soda? I have. Thanks to my players' creativity, we tried it and loved it. Between the food, the environment, and the role-playing, everybody put in a ton of effort to make each game session memorable.

It lasted a year. I thought I'd be there longer, but I was moved. And I'm not only sad to leave, but I really miss those nights with the guys and will probably never have a table quite like it.

So, to my gaming brothers: I miss you, and thank you so much for making that year so memorable.

*Sadly necessary addendum:* In case there are any Christian readers who might be scandalized to know that friars game: we have fun. It's a human need. You like us Franciscans because we're happy people. It's inexpensive entertainment, it brings us together, and I could write a whole treatise on why role-playing games can contribute powerfully to ethical formation. And no, playing the game didn't cause us to get possessed by demons. No matter how hard we tried. ;)

Anyways, thanks Reddit for reading. If you see an excitable friar at a gaming shop who really likes RPGing and isn't cosplaying, come on over and say hi cuz there's a good chance it's me. :)

So FriaLigan is celebrating their Forbidden Lands: Bitter Reach expansion kickstarter launch and they just Tweeted out that they're giving out the Core Game of Forbidden Lands for Free for one day only.

I've ran a few sessions so far with my group and we all completely fell in love with it. We all started from Pathfinder, into D&D 5E and this game is a nice departure from it.

You get the Gamemaster book, Player manual, Legends and Adventurers Booklet, and the Hex Grid Map.

The game's already a steal of a deal in terms of price to content so it being free is pretty great.

~~That being said I am not sure on if it's the updated version? We recently got access to the next ""printing"" in PDF form which had some updated rules. I'm not sure if DriveThru's version is up to date. Either way highly recommend.~~ This is the latest version too! 2nd Printing has some updated rules that were just recently implemented.

If you have any questions about the game I'd be happy to answer! I've not done a super deep dive into anything but from the few sessions I've run I've got a decent handle on things. This is definitely a game I hope more people check out!

EDIT: Now that the event is coming to an end, here's the kickstarter for The Bitter Reach: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/forbidden-lands-the-bitter-reach-campaign-and-reprint?ref=nav_search&result=project&term=forbidden%20Lands",rpg,1568896291.0,0,1477,232
283,519,1cnc7vw,"Remember, Session Zero only works if you actually communicate to each other like an adult. ","Yeah, yeah, this *should* be obvious, but right now I'm watching five months of investment in a campaign implode because people at the table agreed to a session zero, sat down, and then failed to fully voice their expectations and boundaries for the game. I reserve the right to vent a bit.

When our group sat down for our preliminary session of *Monster of the Week*, I walked away feeling like I'd hosted the ideal setup. MotW is a game where character creation is also worldbuilding, so players are effectively building out the campaign from first principles at the same time they're building out their characters. It's the ideal time to nip any concerns about content in the bud. I printed off a common safety checklist, we went around the table doing our Lines & Veils, and we had an open discussion about what we wanted the campaign to be about; on paper, we did everything you're supposed to do.

One of the playbooks in MotW is ""The Monstrous,"" a character born of the campaign's main chosen monster-faction but currently rebelling against their kind. One player quickly settled on playing a vampire-spawn hunting her own kind, and took the ability to mentally dominate humans as a starting ability. She wanted to play a character who struggled a bit with her own toxic impulses and the ease with which she could manipulate other people, because she was interested in playing the kind of character at serious risk of eventually becoming a Keeper-controlled threat, as is one of the fates that can befall The Monstrous as a playbook. As a full group, we discussed our level of comfort with these themes, revisiting our Lines and Veils to discuss how far we were willing to let this go in-game. We set our hard lines, we all agreed emotional abuse was not a line or veil; to reiterate, *we did everything you're supposed to do*.

Except, I guess we didn't. Five months later, eighteen sessions deep, midway through an adventure partially concerned with either freeing the Monstrous character from her curse or losing her to bestial hunger, another player has said OOC they don't want the character on their team anymore. She's crossed too many lines, used too many people; in their opinion, it's deeply uncomfortable that we're discussing redemption for this kind of character at all.

And I'll admit that I'd noticed the friction once or twice before now. Long, quiet streaks after scenes where the Monstrous used her powers to flippantly command civilians, and especially after scenes where she'd use this power on another player who played her partner to shut down arguments (with both players' full consent in playing out a toxic relationship). It's why I'd reached out to this player, repeatedly, checking in to make sure everything happening in the game was okay with them. I was told yes. Now I'm being told no, it's been upsetting them more and more for months, and they aren't having fun playing as a character who would associate with this other PC. In fact, the whole concept has been upsetting them from the start.

Why wasn't this brought up during session zero, when everyone was invited to set their boundaries for the game? *""Because everyone else seemed so excited about the idea,""* so they didn't want to rock the boat.

And I guess... I don't know. I don't know what I could have done differently. I sat everyone down, asked them to discuss what they were comfortable with playing, invited them to reach out in private for anything they felt uncomfortable disclosing in front of the group, and blatantly had that ignored until it festered into a problem beyond salvaging. Everyone is angry at each other now, and losing either player is going to take at least one other player with them, killing the whole game dead in the water.

I get that there's a lot of social awkwardness in this hobby, but what's even the point of building such a culture around safety tools if players are going to be too conflict-averse to use them? We had every chance to solve this five months ago, on the ground floor, before we'd invested all this time into a story at least one player quietly resented the whole time.

285,523,gr2zr9,"Unpopular Opinion: I Buy Games For Mechanics, Not Atmosphere and Lore","I've had a lot of discussions recently regarding what makes someone love a game, and a majority of the time people say that it's the lore, the setting, the atmosphere, and similar aspects that makes them fall in love with a game. Mechanics are a secondary concern more often than not, and a lot of players are more than willing to put up with sloppy, confusing, or messy mechanics if they love the look and feel of the game's world.

I'm on the exact opposite end of this spectrum.

Don't misunderstand me, I am here to tell interesting stories in fun settings. However, spinning story and making a setting is something I can do on my own if I have to. That sort of surface-level stuff is a snap of the fingers. Making a game that functions at a mechanical level, that's balanced, fair, and which isn't going to make me re-write half the rule book for it to actually work, though, is not my strong suit.

On the one hand we all agree there's a lot of room under this big gaming tent that we're all hanging out in. It takes all sorts, and everyone is free to like what makes their game nights better. On the other hand, it's important to know where other gamers are coming from when they talk about games they love. Because one gamer's feature is another gamer's flaw, so it's not enough to know *that* someone loves a particular game... you need to know *why* they love it so you can judge if it's going to be a game that you will also enjoy.",rpg,1590518940.0,0,1442,271

287,525,12vcxn6,"Does anyone else do the ""Zelda thing"" for character and place names?","So, coming up with good names can be difficult. I also happen to be rather picky on that kind of stuff, which means that I often feel a bit restricted when I need a lot of different names. The solution I have found to this issue is simply to reuse names from previous games. At first, I was only doing it sparingly, and only with different players but, as I kept doing it, I realised that it could also be a fun little narrative device for me to play with the players' expectations, *Commedia dell'arte*\-style. 

So what I do now is that I willingly reuse place and character names for ones that have some parallels from one game to the other. For example, I've included a couple shaman/witch characters all named Ruhi, or multiple great cities (usually with some connection to the divine) named Alhandra. I've found that players usually enjoy this type of thing because it makes them feel like they know the world, but without the spoilery part (since each iteration of a name is at least a little different from the previous one).

288,528,dbaz5r,Death by Debt at TSR,"In April of 1996, Random House sued TSR for lack of payment on a $9.5 million loan.

You may ask yourself how TSR came to owe its distributor such a large sum of money. The answer lies in the 1979 distribution agreement between Random House and TSR, in which Random House became TSR's exclusive avenue into the book trade. In that agreement, signed by Gygax himself, Random House agreed to advance TSR 27.3% of the retail value of their product upon receipt. Random House could also return the product to TSR for a refund. All this meant that TSR could produce cash by shipping to Random House instead of waiting for actual customers to purchase their products.

The arrangement seems bizarre, but Jim Fallone, a TSR alum familiar with the agreement, said there may be an excellent reason for it. TSR's books were beautiful, and therefore expensive. Also, TSR had a back catalog that sold well. Sometimes, TSR faced a choice between printing new material, and reprinting old material that sold well, but might take time to make a return on printing costs. The Random House agreement was a way around this problem. TSR could print and ship new copies of the *Player's Handbook* knowing that they would get paid for it soon, and then also afford to print new material.

According to Fallone, the math on all this works out fine, so long as no more than 20% of TSR's products are returned. But in the 90's, TSR's many forays into creating new game worlds increased their levels of returns to more like 30%. At the same time, TSR began overprinting products. *DragonStrike*, for example, was a hit game that was driven into the red by overprinting. The game sold 100,000 copies, and had reorders for 50,000 more. Management, however, decided to print 150,000 copies of the game, which never sold.

Also, TSR began to use Random House to generate ready cash. Fallone said that TSR began to “abuse the loan aspect of the contract by shipping product to Random House that there is no actual sales demand for just to generate the advance payment in order to cover printing debts then you pour gasoline on the fire.""

These practices helped cause TSR's near bankruptcy in 1997.

If you're interested, I talk to TSR alums Jim Lowder and John Rateliff [here](http://plotpoints.libsyn.com/death-by-debt-at-tsr-ep-161) about the contract.

290,530,od2afo,"So I accidentally convinced my players of an Illuminati style conspiracy, and I’m not sure what to do about it.","Just doing a few oneshots for a bit, and for fun, made my own list of random encounters for when they’re traveling. Nothing ridiculous, just stuff like bandits, random traders, a wagon train of people, etc…

I made it so one of the players got to roll percentage dice to determine their random encounters so they felt like they were involved, and everything was working fine, until they rolled a joke encounter I made that was the only 1% chance, the next lowest being 9%, followed by the rest all being 10%. 

This one percent encounter was they come across a campfire just off the road, and if they sneak up to it, which they did successfully, they would hear talking. 

Well, our rogue who had dark vision, which I forgot about, snuck up close enough, and saw the talking was coming from a set of 6 mimics, all in chest forms, speaking common, and talking about business dealings they had, at one point, without thinking, I said one of them mentioned a monopoly. 

The joke was going to be they would hear the talking, but once they got close enough, the mimics would clam up, and never speak again. When confronted, they would offer silent trades like little vending machines, by showing a treasure item in their mouth, and waiting for the players to make an offer. 

I’d had mimics act like simple, and sometimes fun little traders before so this wouldn’t be new for the players, but I’d established that mimics couldn’t verbally communicate.

I forgot the rogue could see them clear as day in the dark, so they didn’t get close enough for the mimics to notice him, but he could clearly see their lids flapping as they talked.

The group retreated, and chatted about this, and I immediately realized my problem when they mentioned the Illuminati. 

My players are now convinced there’s an Illuminati style group made up exclusively by mimics, controlling multiple trade monopolies like a council of business villains.

Luckily it was getting late anyway, so I managed to stop the session after they set up shifts to watch the camp from a distance, and plan on following them when they leave.

So now I have the party convinced a group of joke mimics are somehow evil business masterminds, and they plan on following them at the start of next session.",rpg,1625332856.0,0,2255,397

This is as true of an rpg campaign as it is of meal at a new restaurant or a bad commute. Having an image in your mind of how the game is going to unfold, how cool the epic moments are going to be, and how immersed your players are going to be in the story all invite disappointment.  


Beyond that basic problem with expectation in all walks of life, rpgs have something special about them no other form of entertainment does, or even can: uncertainty is built into the form as a major feature. Not knowing where ""the story"" is going is the point. Not knowing which NPCs will be important, which PCs will live past the first session, what plot threads get pulled, and so on are all important aspects of play that make the thing work as a whole.  


It's the difference between world building and campaign building. The former can create a sense of depth that really immerses the participants and allows the GM to respond with consistent and agile improvisation. The latter can make players feel railroaded and lock out opportunities that would otherwise have been awesome.  


If you are spending a long time crafting a ""story"" before the players hit the table, ask yourself why. What are you trying to accomplish? Are you setting up yourself for disappointment when the players inevitably disrupt or, worse, ignore your carefully crafted narrative? Are you trying to show the players how great a storyteller you are, instead of helping them show one another how great a story they can create together?  


None of this is to say you have to start a campaign blind. (I mean, you can, and I think everyone should try it once just to experience what a truly beautiful chaotic mess it can be.) But instead of deciding how it is going to go, just set up the situation and have a solid idea of what would happen if the PCs did not get involved. Then let them loose on the setting and situation and see what happens. Allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised by their strange choices and the unexpected fallout from die rolls.

299,543,ecat7a,"Unpopular opinion: RPGs with ""easy to learn"" rules are actually not beginner-friendly.","_TL;DR: Having more rules helps unexperienced players and GMs to deal with uncommon/unexpected situations. Therefore so-called beginner friendly systems are often not very beginner friendly._

&nbsp;

First of all I should mention that I don't have a ton of RPG experience. I've only played/mastered 5 different systems now. The one that I played (and GM'ed) the most is called ""Aborea"". It is a German system that is marketed as very beginner-friendly.

&nbsp;

Getting more and more into different RPG systems, I feel like it was a mistake to spend so much time with Aborea. The ""easier"" rules of Aborea often times led to situations being unclear, searching for a possible rule or discussing the (rather short) rulebook. Being an unexperienced GM, I was forced to improvise a lot or to tell my players that some actions didn't have an effect because there was no rule for it.

Example: The players manage to set an enemy on fire, but there is no rule for the damage dealt by this action. Now the GM either has to improvise (by considering an appropriate amount of damage that the fire deals) or has to claim that it has no effect.

&nbsp;

We are preparing for a ""Das Schwarze Auge"" (I think it's ""The Dark Eye"" in english) campaign at the moment. While being the most popular system in Germany, DSA is said to be not very beginner-friendly.

Getting into DSA though, it actually seems easier to play (and master), _because_ there are more rules. It feels like there is a rule for everything, nothing remains unclear. You sure have to look up many things, but the detailed rules (and lore) can provide more solutions for uncommon situations/decisions. This certainty can help unexperienced GMs.

&nbsp;

So, in my opinion, RPGs with fewer/""easier"" rules should not necessarily be described as beginner friendly. It could even be reversed, like less rules = more experience needed. Am I totally wrong here?",rpg,1576664424.0,0,1908,323

302,549,np4c5p,What overused trope in RPGs do you still enjoy no matter what?,"I thought about this recently and even after 15 years in the hobby, I always enjoy a good **Sewer crawl** in my game either as a GM or as a player.

Be it in sci-fi or fantasy games, there is always so much to do in a game with sewers and I'm not even talking about fighting dire rats.  


* **Bandits**. You find locals trafficking or hiding stashes of loot down there, black market and escape routes. Perfect way to find the literal underworld from your city;
* **Methane pockets**. Careful where you bring that torch, keep track of the air stench even through all this foul smell;
* **Disease**. Such a wonderful to scare players of even more experience. Any open wounds could result in longer term consequences to deal with;
* **Mutated monsters**. The weird discarded things people just throw down their toilets is enough to create a bunch of monsters with unexpected variation type. What about a two-headed crocodile instead of a regular one?
* **Mushrooms and fungi**. You can find some rare and poisonous growth there that could make any dire exploration even more disastrous. Hallucinations are no joke;
* **Undead**. Mix monsters with fungi and you got yourself a nice recipe for a walking parasite that reproduce by murdering people and  getting spores into open wounds to repopulate.

There are a lot more things you can do with sewers such as dumping lore about the city or what is being hidden from the people here. The claustrophobia of the environment + the danger of the darkness and murky water + the constant threat of disease and longer terms penalty for a mistake always make for tense sessions.

It's like walking next to lava but that could bring a slower and more painful death. Also it's easier to access in most campaign than a volcano.

Anyway, as I was thinking about that I thought that more people probably have some tropes they enjoy and put some twist on to keep fresh or something and I might as well ask to get some ideas for later date right?",rpg,1622470371.0,0,1977,351

306,554,1fbklo7,I think I realized why I don’t want to play D&D anymore,"It’s the fucking D20 dice mechanic. 

I’m 47 and have been playing since AD&D. But I’ve found myself in a situation where I feel like I have to min max my D&D characters for them to be fun. 

When I roll up a fighter, I have to optimize every weapon, feat, and subclass for combat because 1)it’s such a huge part of the game and 2)even if your character is reasonably good at something, the d20 is so swingy that unless you’re TEH BEST you have these feel bad moments where your supposedly capable character comes off feeble because of the dice. 

Those kind of ridiculous failures then make it hard to pursue the narrative ideas I have under-pinning the character.

To get around this I find myself playing characters with more open-ended abilities. Mask of Many Faces and minor illusion come to mind because they allow so much consistency and flexibility. But why can’t I have that kind of open-endedness or expect that kind of internal consistency with all classes?

I might try the whole “roll 3d20, choose the middle value” approach to kill some of that swingy-ness. Draw Steel seems interesting because of the 2d10 roll mechanic. 

I’d love to play D&D, but that just kills it for me. Any other alternatives?

Edit: First off, thank you everyone for such an amazing discussion. There are discussions around everything from dice mechanics to DM style to whether I secretly love min-maxing. 

This topic seems to be a Rorschach test of some sorts and that’s fair because the topic goes beyond just the dice roll. The reason I love this hobby is because it’s personal. It’s so innately human and everyone has brought that fully to this discussion. Thank you. ",rpg,1725752884.0,0,1662,290

308,558,9jvttp,Never put a Brothel in an adventure.,"Story time. So me and about 5 or 6 of my friends we like to make our own P&P adventures. Its really fun, the GM gets to be creative and watch how others tear down his perfect story. This is exactly like that.   


The start of the story was that our group was supposed to save the daughter of a millionaire. There was a certain terrorist organisation who could've kidnapped her. So me and my team, being a human detective, an elf healer, a human wizard and someone you could describe like an ork but stronger and even more stupid and one dwarven technician. So we went into a tavern and got a lead, that maybe the local Brothel could have some ladies who know about the terrorist group, since they were known to hang out at such shady places.

&#x200B;

 So our group went to the Brothel (I don't know any other word for brothel other than whorehouse, so I'll just keep on writing Brothel)  and started searching for clues. The Healer and wizard both went searching for some hidden passages/doors where some could possibly hide. The dwarf went ahead and got himself a lady and the detective (me) wanted to talk to a ""lady or the evening"". So she took me in a room where we talked about the terrorist group and what maybe going on in the Brothel, since the workers just disappeared. This is where it gets funny.  


I realized that I didn't have any money on me. The prostitute wanted some money though, which is why I, backed up into a corner by my own stupidity, decided that killing the prostitute who was actually made a pretty nice character wasn't the worst choice. Wrong.  


So I went ahead and, did that. I got a malus on every single aspect of my character. Meanwhile my friends found stairs leading to a dungeon of sorts, lots of closed and empty cells, much like in a prison.  


So I decided to tell the boss that her worker would be downstairs shortly with the money I gave her. Yikes.   


The GM trying to make this a good round, punished me by making me forget to clean my hands. So I stood in front of her with blood all over my Hands. Instantly ran downstairs where we killed about 4 bouncers from the Brothel. 2 of them, we found out later by the GM, weren't supposed to be killed. Then the dungeon got infiltrated by Guards with man-high shields. Obviously Guards from the City, who were there to arrest us, and once again, to not die at our hands.  


There were a total of 6 Guards, everyone died because of us. They had awful throws after awful throws, while we were getting quite lucky. The Ork just straight up Ran into the first 3 Guards and killed them almost immediately while the rest were on the other 3. It was a disaster, from a moral point of view. We ended up fleeing the Brothel while we were chased by a magician who told us that we could run but never hide. When our group came to the realization what just happened, we agreed to join the terrorist organisation because apparently we are the bad guys now.  


TL;DR: My group went into a brothel the good guys and ended up joining a terrorist organisation and were wanted state wide because I was too stupid to pay a hooker.

309,559,i7f8tp,How I Turned a PC Into a Pig and Handled Them Being Happy About It,"Context: I'm running a homebrew system/setting about students studying to become licensed adventurers. During their final exam for their first semester, they came across a boss inspired by ""The Wolf"" character from fairy tales, One of the signature moves of the boss was them turning to a PC and shouting ""RUN! RUN LITTLE PIGGY!"" forcing them to make a very high save DC or be turned into a pig for 1 hour. I intended this to be a hard debuff, something they'd have to play around, but something that would go away after the climax of the adventure concluded. After an extremely close fight, they ended up winning with the PC (now a Pig) landing the killing blow. We ran out of time and the session was over. But I had a new problem.

In the post-session chats it became clear that the player turned into a pig was super excited about the role playing challenge of being a Pig, especially since he was transformed while none of the other PCs could see it happen, and the players were spending time talking trying to figure out how long the curse would last, how they would break it, how they'd figure out the Pig was their classmate etc. I only intended this to last 1 hour, and break on its own, but considering all the excitement in the team around this, I felt that starting the next session by informing them that the PC turned back into a human during a short rest would be very disappointing to my players. However, I wasn't prepared for having the PC be stuck as a pig for an extended period of time, and furthermore didn't want to penalize the player for being interested in the role-playing opportunity by upgrading the curse to a permanent curse.

So at the start of the session I asked the PC controlling the pig how their character felt about being a pig, what the internal monologue was about. The response was ""at first it was inconvenient, but now I see it comes with advantages. For the first time in my life I can eat whatever I want and people think it's cute not disgusting."" I told them to tell me if that inner monologue changed. The idea being, if it did, and he resisted, that he would turn back into human, though I didn't communicate this to the players. We then played out the rest of the adventure with the party finally learning that the pig was their classmate, navigating back out of the enchanted forest to the exam entrance, and rolling a random encounter against... boars and the PC using his new pig form to successfully negotiate safe passage through their territory using their animal handling skill and a large supply of extra rations.

After finishing the exam, the player eventually sought out the Druid Professor specializing in Beast Forms. In this meeting he learned that the curse had mostly expired and that if he wished to return to being a human he need only see himself as a human, but once that happened he would no longer be able to be a pig. Unless he signed up for his class of course. 

We then spent some remaining end of semester downtime with the character as a pig, until a random event happened with him reporting to the kitchen to serve time for his work study with the cooks, and the ogre chef saw this pig, not recognizing it as the character, and tried to capture him and berated him for making a mess of his kitchen. This insulted the character, since he had earlier earned the title of ""Award Winning Chef"" for winning the school festival cooking competition, and in thinking of himself as the Award Winning Chef, the PC narrated his character turning back into a human, much to the shock of the Ogre Chef. 

So instead of getting a combat debuff, I ended up with some fantastic story beats that would never have happened otherwise. 

Anyway, thank you for attending my story time. Do any of you have related stories of throw away debuffs turning into minor or major plot points in your games? How did you handle it?",rpg,1597098522.0,0,3879,704

You may also want to have a long-winded epic tale, but consider that you need to explore more types of games and even systems.

- Even if you're in love with a system you play, you may get insight from playing other systems.

- Even if you do three different short games in the same system you're 100% sure you love, you were able to do have different approaches to it. Imagine investigating and fighting an active cult in the 1800s, finding old secrets in a manor long abandoned in the present and discovering a very scary conspiracy in the 1500s in CoC instead of just the first option. You'll learn a lot from diversity.

- You will be able to run all cool ideas on your mind.

- Games that have an ending are very cool. Ever had one? If not, try it. Taste the satisfaction of an ending and an epilogue. Make the epic sacrifices really mean something.

- You may experiment with a lot of ways to GM. You may not like to GM what you like to play. I like to play adventuring dungeoncrawls! I sure as hell hate GMing them.

- You may experiment with a lot of ways to play. The first time I ran political intrigue and conspiracy, I was a GM. I discovered then that I have a very found love for political intrigue and conspiracy since.

Don't plan any game to take over six months (this is a different number of game sessions for each group). If you like the short game, you may build a new one as a sequel. If you didn't like it so much but liked it just enough to continue playing, at least you can find something better to play without a premature end.",rpg,1655138726.0,0,1638,313

Here's the thing, though.  As a GM, you have pretty much the authoritative view of the world in your head.  Like, for the most part, if you believe something to be true, it is.  And that doesn't just go for actual facts, but it also goes for cultures, reactions, etc.

One actual story I saw involved a character insulting the king of the country, and then being surprised when there was an extremely negative reaction (which I don't recall if it were imprisonment or straight up murder death kill).

Clearly, the GM thought that was reasonable.  Clearly, the player did not expect that.  And that's fine, the problem is that the GM's opinion is *objectively correct* in terms of the actual workings of the world.

So, when players suggest something suicidal, or with obvious negative consequences, *clarify the situation*.  Presume that this dumb move is not actually dumb, but is in fact a rational (ish) choice *based on inaccurate or incomplete information*.  And since you're the only one who *knows* the actual information, it is your job to ensure that the players know as much as their character would, and that they see what their character sees.  If anything, err on the side of over-disclosure, because your words are the only conduit that the players have to the world.

Apocalypse World calls it ""Name the consequences and act"".  And that's a way better approach than the typical ""are you sure?"" question that GMs typically use.  Because if you ask a player that, and give them no information, of *course* they're going to come up with the same answer!

A player might say:  ""I insult the King!""

You know this is a terrible idea, and will result in quick retribution or punishment.  So.... let's assume the player isn't dumb.  They would then only insult the King if they felt that doing so wouldn't result in quick imprisonment or retribution.  So clarify this with what the character would know, and ask.

""Yeah, you totally want to do that, and that's understandable.  But, you know that the rulers in this land are pretty sketchy on the topic of insults.  Heck, someone was hung just last week for impugning the King's honor.  And all the guards look a little on edge due to having you unkempt adventurers in there.  They're pretty obviously willing to throw down, and they look dangerous enough that things probably wouldn't go well for you.  So, is that something you still want to do?""

Here, we've clarified any misconceptions, and told the player everything the character would know and see.  Now, there's no way for them to claim that they didn't know what would happen, and if they choose to continue on that path, they can *own* the decision.

You're the only one who knows all the things.  It's *your job* to ensure that the players have correct and complete information, to the extent of their characters' knowledge and perceptions.  And, if anything, err on the side of giving out more info.",rpg,1599602019.0,0,3203,552
322,578,qtxqm1,Why GMing Isn't More Popular (& How Players & GMs Can Help Change That),"Recently, a post on r/dndnext [posed a simple question](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/qok9yr/how_can_we_make_more_people_want_to_dm/): How can the community make more people want to DM? It's not an easy question to answer, but it is one I think about a lot as someone who runs two (sometimes three) games a week - so I figured why not give my two cents. 

I want to explore why GMing isn't more popular as-is and follow up with suggestions the community or potential GMs may find helpful in making the role easier to access. This is far from an in-depth exploration of this topic, but hopefully, some will find it useful as an overview. 

## 5e Is Hard to GM. Like, Really Hard.

When I tell other GMs I run more than one game a week, they usually follow up by asking how prep doesn't monopolize my whole week. The answer is pretty simple: I don't run 5e, because 5e is hard as fuck to GM. 

**Although 5e is an awesome, jack-of-all trades system for players with a lot of versatility, it places a** ***huge*** **amount of responsibility on the GM.** While 5e is seen as the default ""introductory"" system for most players, I'd actually argue it's one of the hardest games to GM efficiently. 

I run my games in Pathfinder Second Edition and Worlds Without Number, and both are *leagues* easier to prep for and actually GM than 5e, albeit in different ways. **Let's look at some of the reasons why 5e is difficult to run:**

* **The books are poorly organized.** You never know how many pages you'll need to jump between to answer a simple question, and it's tedious. The fact that most books released in recent years were aimed at players instead of GMs also makes the GM role feel less supported than it deserves. 
* **The lore of the Forgotten Realms is difficult to parse, and most official adventures don't continue past lower levels.** As a result, making a game in the base Forgotten Realms setting is challenging, so many GMs will want to homebrew something or run a game in another official setting. While that's not terrible, it does mean contributing more effort or money to the hobby, which is just another barrier for new GMs to surpass. You'll also need to diverge from official adventures eventually if you want to run a 1-20 campaign (unless you want to use *Dungeon of the Mad Mage,* but c'mon). 
* **Combat is difficult to design and run.** Creature ratings aren't exactly known for their accuracy, and 5e stat blocks tend to be pretty simple, so GMs often end up homebrewing new abilities or scenarios to make encounters more engaging. It's a huge drain on prep time. Combat also becomes a slog in tiers three and four, making high-level play challenging to run. 
* **The ""rulings, not rules"" philosophy of the system burdens the GM with making moment-to-moment decisions.** As a result, the GM must often make consequential choices that players may disagree with. I've had more player disputes about rulings in 5e than any other system I've run. This isn't even getting into how auxiliary rules ""authorities,"" such as Sage Advice, make understanding or finding rulings even harder. 
* **The system isn't designed for the popular style of play.** D&D 5e encourages a high magic, combat-heavy, dungeon-delving playstyle (as the name implies) with lots of downtime between dungeons and fast leveling. There's a reason plate armor takes [75 days to craft](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/o8acsd/1_workweek_to_craft_a_50gp_comon_item_is/) RAW, but it only takes [37 adventuring days](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/65wikz/on_average_how_long_does_it_take_to_reach_level/) of medium encounters to get from level 1-20. This foundation is in stark contrast to the RP-heavy, day-by-day style of play most groups prefer. Groups can - and should - play as they want, but since the popular style of play contradicts the system, GMs have to do even more work to make the system function well if they run against it. 

These aren't the only things that make 5e hard to GM, but they're some of the big culprits that I think push GMs away. These issues are not mutually exclusive, either - they work in concert to make 5e uniquely challenging to run. Yes, you can address many of them by consuming supplemental material, such as Matt Colville's magnificent series [*Running the Game*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-YZvLUXcR8), but that makes sourcing and consuming third-party information another obstacle for new GMs to overcome. 

I purposefully avoided talking about social issues in the above section to illustrate a point: Even with an ideal group of players, 5e places so many hurdles in front of prospective GMs, it's little surprise many decide not to run the race. 

In contrast, I find both Pathfinder 2e and Worlds Without Number significantly easier to run. While the systems in and of themselves are considerably different, **they share similarities that contribute to their ease of use:**

* **The system materials are well-organized.** Finding answers to rules questions is easy and intuitive. More importantly, these systems actively eschew the ""rulings, not rules"" philosophy. Instead, they have clearly defined rules for everything that is likely to happen in an average adventuring day (and in the case of Pathfinder 2e, more besides). Having a clear-cut answer to every commonly asked question - one that's easy to find, no less - leads to fewer rules disputes at the table, and less time spent on navigating the material. 
* **Combat and exploration rules are easy to utilize (and they** ***work*****).** In Pathfinder 2e especially, creature levels (equivalent to creature ratings in 5e) are incredibly accurate, and statblocks have a wide range of flavorful abilities. Creating dynamic encounters is as easy as plugging creatures into the encounter-building rules and trusting the system, which is a far cry from the hours I'd spend trying to finagle and balance encounters in my 5e games to make combat more dynamic and enjoyable. 
* **The systems work for one encounter per day games.** In my experience, most players today prefer exploration and roleplay to combat encounters. You can easily run one encounter per day in Pathfinder 2e and Worlds Without Number (although they handle exploration and combat in vastly different ways) and come away with a challenging, fulfilling adventure without making the adjustments you'd need to achieve the same experience in 5e. 
* **The base settings are compelling**. Both Pathfinder 2e and Worlds Without Number have very digestible, compelling worldbuilding and timelines, making it easy for new GMs to design homebrew campaigns without building a whole new world (or purchasing a book for one). Pathfinder 2e's Adventure Paths also go from level 1-20, allowing new GMs who want a classic 1-20 campaign but don't feel comfortable homebrewing one to run a fulfilling game with minimal barrier to entry or need to consume third-party materials. 

Choosing to move away from 5e and run Pathfinder 2e and Worlds Without Number has made my life as a GM notably easier. I would *love* it if we saw an effort by WotC to make 5e easier to run. I'd be lying if I said I have hope that 5.5e will be more GM-friendly, but it sure would be a pleasant surprise. 

I'm not just here to bash 5e. Other systems also have a relatively small number of GMs compared to players, so let's talk about some other reasons GMing is hard. 

## GMs Act as Social Arbiters for Tables

At most tables, GMs are responsible not only for running the game (which is already a lot to handle), but they also have the final - and frequently, the only - say on any interpersonal conflicts that occur at the table. 

Problem player making someone (or everyone) uncomfortable? It's usually on the GM to call them out, in or out of game, and see if they can resolve the issue or need to kick the player. 

Player has an issue with RP or game balance? They usually have to go through the GM to resolve that issue or choose to leave the game. 

Player(s) need to cancel? It's on the GM to decide whether the game goes on or not, and if not, when the table should convene next. 

Players don't take notes? It's up to the GM to dig out their record of the last session and remind everyone what happened so the game can keep functioning. 

On the one hand, I get it. Nobody likes conflict. Even if a player breaks the social contract of a table, it can feel shitty to tell them they need to leave, especially if the table is a substantial part of their support network. Nobody likes being the ""bad guy"" who tells people to get their shit together so a game can happen regularly or notifies a player that they're taking too much spotlight. 

The GM also naturally has an increased responsibility at the table due to their role. If the GM doesn't show up to run the game, the game doesn't happen. In most groups - especially those formed online - the GM is responsible for bringing all the players to the table in the first place. As a result, the GM often becomes the Judge Dredd of TTRPG social issues.

It's a lot of responsibility to take on in addition to putting a game together. Worse still, it contributes to the GM vs. Player mentality some players have. Most GMs I know often complain about feeling like schoolteachers as much as Game Masters, which obviously isn't great. 

In an ideal world, GMs would be able to expect mature behavior, a fundamental understanding of tabletop etiquette, and the social contract of the table from players. Unfortunately, the standing precedent that GMs are responsible for solving the majority of conflicts that arise at tables pushes away prospective GMs who are either conflict-avoidant or just don't want (understandably) to have to police the behavior of adults over a game. 

## You Have to Love Prep (& How Your Players Ruin It)

Most acting coaches tell students the same thing: To be a successful actor, [you have to learn to love auditioning](http://www.workingactorwisdom.com/blog/2015/9/15/learn-to-love-auditions), because you'll spend more time in auditions than you will on screen. 

GMs need to have a similar relationship to game prep. Of course, the amount of prep you do as a GM is system-dependent to a large degree. **But at the very least, you have to enjoy the process of things like:** 

* Creating NPC personalities and speech patterns or voices;
* Sourcing or making battle maps; 
* Balancing encounters;
* Piloting the plot and establishing story beats;
* Working with players on backstories and weaving said backstories into the campaign;
* Deciding how the world moves and breathes around the players;
* Learning the ins and outs of the system mechanics;
* Remaining updated on the newest developments of the system;
* Collaborating with players to ensure everyone's having a good time;
* Taking notes on player actions and how they interact with the world;

The list goes on and on. Point being, prepping for a game is a hell of a lot of work, and it doesn't stop when the game starts. Even in relatively rules-lite games, such as *Dungeon World, Worlds Without Number,* or *Stonetop*, you'll end up doing a significant amount of prep - and if you don't like it, you're probably not going to find GMing much fun. 

As a result of the time investment required to GM, most GMs feel incredibly attached to their worlds and characters, and rightfully so. Of course, another crucial aspect of GMing is rolling with the punches and having players fuck with - or up - - or just period - the things you create. For many GMs, that's hard - and who can blame them? 

*I'd like to note here that I'm not talking about players who try and purposefully fuck with their GM or the table. Amazing, well-intentioned players will come up with solutions the GM never considered or want to try things unaccounted for during prep. Learning to enable such experiences if it would enhance the fun of the table is essential, but can be challenging.* 

The lack of investment many players have in their games further complicates issues. For many GMs, their campaigns and worlds occupy a significant portion of their lives and thoughts. Not so for many players, or at the very least, not to the same degree. 

The obligations of players and GMs are inherently imbalanced in a way that can make behavior most players wouldn't think twice about - such as constantly joking when a GM attempts to foster a serious moment, barbing the GM about a missed ruling or failing to add something to a character sheet, etc. - much more hurtful and disrespectful from the GM's perspective. As a result, many GMs seem overly protective of their worlds and games, at least from a player's point of view. 

For new GMs who aren't used to navigating this dynamic, the process of painstakingly creating a world or session and then handing it off to players can feel like pitching an egg at someone and hoping they catch it without making a scramble. 

The good news, of course, is that a table of players who understand the social contract of TTRPGs can help Gms make a world far more vibrant, fun, and interesting than anything they could create on their own. 

The bad news, is that when a GM is attached to their world, they'll get hurt when players don't treat your game with respect. Having players cancel on you last minute or fail to take notes isn't just a bummer because you don't get to play or have to explain something again; it feels like your friends are actively choosing to disrespect the amount of time it takes to prep for and run a game - valid feelings that should be taken more seriously if we want more people to run games. 

At the end of the day, GMing for any system takes a hell of a lot of work, love, and effort (and even more so for 5e). With so many obstacles in front of the average GM, it's little wonder most choose to forego running games entirely, or abandon GMing after their first attempts. 

## Give Ya GM a Break - Player Practices to Encourage More GMs

So, let's return to the premise of this discussion - how can the community encourage more people to GM? I'll break this into two components - things players can do to make life easier for GMs, and things GMs can do to make life easier for themselves. 

**First, let's cover some things players can do to help GMs out:**

* **Go with the plan.** I get it. One of the best parts about TTRPGs is the ability to just kinda do... whatever (within reason of the boundaries set by the table and the basic social contract of not being a bad person). Despite how tempting doing whatever can be, respect where your GM is guiding the story. Going off in a completely different direction just because you think it may be fun will almost always lead to a less satisfying experience than working with the GM to engage with prepped content, and it often has the additive effect of pissing off players who want to follow a main or side quest delineated by the GM. 
* **Trust the GM.** At a mature table, everyone is there to ensure each other has fun - GM included. Unless your  GM is clearly fucking with you, try not to second-guess them regarding enemy or NPC behavior and dice rolls. It can be very easy to view the GM as someone playing against you, but that should never be the case - the GM should be there to give the party a guiding hand towards a fulfilling gameplay experience. Giving some trust to the GM is a vital part of the social contract of the table. 
* **Make discussions tablewide.** As we discussed, concerns about player behavior or other tablewide mechanics often become discussions few are privy to. Players can help alleviate some of the burden of GMing by encouraging tablewide conversations about concerns and feedback. Making the table an open forum for more matters can help everyone trust each other and quickly identify acceptable compromises. 
* **Do your own bookkeeping.** I never mind reiterating a point or two to players, but keep in mind that failing to remember an important NPC's name after the third meeting makes it looks like you just don't care about the story. This also extends to character sheets. GMs have to deal with NPC and monster stat blocks; they shouldn't be responsible for figuring out how your character operates. You should know your attack bonuses, saving throws, armor class, what your spells do, etc., without the GM's aid. 
* **Notify the table of scheduling issues in advance.** Scheduling issues are one of the most oft-cited issues at TTRPG tables. Failing to notify the table of your absence at least a few days in advance is simply disrespectful (outside of emergencies, obviously). If your GM can spend hours in the week leading up to the session prepping a gameplay experience for you, you can spend 15 seconds on a message saying you won't be able to attend in advance. This is particularly vital in games where player backstories are a focus - nothing feels worse than prepping a session for a player's backstory, only to have them cancel at the last minute. 
* **Be an active participant at the table.** You should always try to stay engaged, even when your character isn't the focus of a scene - or hell - is off-screen entirely. These are your friends you're at the table with. Give them your time and respect. The more invested everyone is in each other's story, the more fun the game will be in its entirety. Don't be the person who pulls their phone out or interjects anytime their character isn't the focus. 
* **Make a character for the party.** Antagonists and anti-heroes work well in other forms of media because we can root against them - Boromir is one of my favorite characters in *Lord of the Rings,* but I'd hate to share a table with him. It takes a hell of a player to pull off an evil character without making it an issue for everyone else, and a hell of a table to make that kind of arc fun for everyone. Unless the whole table agrees evil characters are kosher, players should make someone who will, at the very least, work with the party. If a character is only kept at the table because the players don't want to make a friend sad by exiling his weird edgy mess of an alter-ego, that's not a good character. Dealing with such dynamics can also be very troublesome as a GM. 

This is far from an exhaustive list - another blog for another time, perhaps - but I think if more players made a conscious effort to take these issues into account, GMing would undoubtedly be a lot more inviting. 

## Give Yaself a Break - Making GMing Easier

**With ways players can make the GM role less intimidating covered, let's look at how GMs can help themselves:**

* **Set defined boundaries.** It's okay to tell players that certain races/ancestries/what have you aren't allowed at the table, or that characters can't worship evil deities and should all be part of the same organization. You should collaborate with the table to find a premise for the game everyone is happy with (yourself included!), but setting boundaries is extremely important. You're there to have fun, not headache over how to incorporate outrageous homebrews or character concepts that don't fit your campaign into your world. 
* **Consider other systems.** As I mentioned, 5e is hard as fuck to GM, at least in my experience. If you want a more narrative-based experience, I'd suggest looking into Dungeon World for something analogous to 5e but much more RP-focused. Stonetop, Blades in the Dark, Apocalypse World, and other Powered By the Apocalypse games are also great for more narrative experiences. If you want tactical combat and lots of character options, consider something like Pathfinder 2e. You don't have to move away from 5e by any means, but it never hurts to have alternatives. 
* **Allocate prep time wisely.** No, you don't need to know the names of everyone in the town - that's why you keep a name generator open. When prepping for a session, always think about where you would go and who you would want to interact with as a player. Focus on quality over quantity - make a few memorable NPCs or locations where your players are, and steer them in the direction of those individuals and places. The truth is, few players will care about things like exactly how much gold the local currency translates into, or what each townsfolk's background is. But topics such as *why* the town doesn't use gold, or a vignette showcasing the types of lives townsfolk lead may go over better. Prep should be enjoyable and help your world make a lasting impression on the party, not be a chore. 
* **Steal shit when possible.** I won't say how much my Patreon bill amounts to out of shame, but I use other people's shit *constantly* (although, I suppose it's not exactly stealing if it's paid for). The wealth of resources surrounding TTRPGs on the internet is mindboggling. The amount of free and paid content GMs have access to is ridiculous, so make like a renaissance painter and co-opt as much of it as you possibly can for your game. Two heads are almost always better than one - even if you end up entirely warping the concept of something you find online to make it suit your world, third-party material is extremely useful as a source of inspiration. 
* **Accept imperfection.** Unless you're a GM who happens to make a lot of money off their game and also be a trained actor, don't hold yourself to the standard of a Brendan Lee Mulligan or Matthew Mercer. Your games won't always be perfect. You'll have plot holes. Some NPCs will use the same voice. You won't always be prepped for every path players take. Sometimes an encounter won't be as fun as you'd hoped. And you know what? Good. You've got a life to live and shit to do. GM because it's fun, not because you feel like a slave to how perfect your table could be if you only had this or did that. Always strive for improvement, but accept imperfections. 

At the end of the day, TTRPGs work best as a medium when everyone is as concerned about each other's fun and experiences as they are about their own. GMing is unpopular due to the obstacles in front of new GMs and how the role currently functions in TTRPG pop culture, but both GMs and players can take steps to make running games less daunting.",rpg,1636919234.0,0,22194,3840

They aren't released yet, but when they are they will probably be between £12-15 (printed customs are tough to make, man). We'll be offering plenty of accessories and weapons to go along with them :)

The plan is that people will be able to buy their own character as a custom printed LEGO minifigure. We've made outfits for 12 classes, and heads for the more common races (and a couple of extra heads that seemed like they'd work well with specific classes). We'll also be selling a variety of hair types made by LEGO, including some with elf-like ears, and also some hoods and capes.

The thing is, there's a lot to do and you all seemed like you'd have pretty useful feedback. So here's the first draft!

1. Do the outfits and faces fit your expectations? Like is the Barbarian too clothed? Is that how you picture dwarf facial hair? Do you like where the sigils are located on the cleric and paladin (the sigils themselves will be customisable)?

2. We tried to make the outfits unisex, but are there any outfits here where you think we specifically need to do a female version?

3. Would you be happy with those outfit colours, or do you think we should do a specifically different colour for any particular class? Or would you really want a choice of colours for any of them?

4. We can't make custom-shaped pieces, so we've done designs for the tiefling and dragonborn on normal minifigure head shapes. Do you think it works?

5. Is there anything obvious we're missing here? e.g. is there a head you would have expected us to do that we've missed out?

Any other feedback you have is also greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance; I can't wait to hear your thoughts! This has been a long time coming :)

RPGs are the best damn thing ever. Get together with friends, be yourself, everyone has a good time (even the rules debates are good fun with close friends).

However, as we get older and priorities shift to kid-having, job-doing, and holy-shit-I'm-tireding in the evenings, RPGs fall off the map. As we get older, there's less time for creativity as we try and push through each day to make it to the weekend. If you have kids, that weekend gets carved up pretty damned quick.

RPGs are amazing because of the creative energy that takes place in them. As we get older, we need more of this to feel like human beings with thoughts in our heads that are interesting. Funny thing is, 'success' is like a big, damn rewind in years as far as the perception of RPGs. I've found the higher up you get promoted, the more the hobby is received as odd or silly.

I went through all this and am emerging to try and recapture that much-needed creativity. What I'm finding is that young folks are deeply protective of their groups at my FLGS and aren't looking for some older 'fogey' to mess up the dynamic.

I've tried card games and found them too 'mechanical' for my tastes.

I know that online gaming is a thing, but I sit at a computer all day and would prefer to get away from it.

Maybe some old school gamers will say Silver Age  if they consider the ADND, GURPS, Travelers era the Golden Age.  When I started RPGs, it was dnd at the last gasps of 2 and the start of 3 into 3.5.
Years later adventure League was like 3 tables at Comic Con, a sub group at best.  

Board games were Rio Grande, Fantasy Flight and Hasbro/Avalon and number of  others, not nearly as much as now.

Now both industries have tons of smaller independent presses.  Adventure League is 20 -30 tables or more at some conventions.  So much more people.  So much more inclusivity.  So more eyes on the product and interest in design

Will this be the peak of creativity and innovation.  Every popular thing hits that peak bench mark and everything is good but not quiet the same.  Rock music in the 60s and 70s.  Rap music in the 90s and 80s.  That might be too subjective.  How about Pixar, they had a peak of creative vibrance.

I’ve just launched [Quinns Quest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c29Ecut4K_E&ab_channel=QuinnsQuest), a brand-new YouTube channel covering TTRPGs. It has a truly bonkers aesthetic that I arrived at with the help of an art director and a (BAFTA-winning!) musician. You’ll... see what I mean if you click that link.

When we started SU&SD in 2011 it was because the kind of quality coverage of board games that we wanted to see? Just didn’t exist. So, we decided to make it.

Quinns Quest is me following that same impulse. I’ve come to love plenty of RPG content creators in the last few years - [RTFM](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/aaron-king2), [Yes Indie’d Pod](https://www.patreon.com/indierpg/posts) and [GoblinMixtape](https://www.tiktok.com/@goblinmixtape) to name a few - but I could tell from how my recent reviews of [Spire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWmI_6p9rGg) and [Alice is Missing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSwIx_D3u6Q) popped off on Shut Up & Sit Down that more people than just me were in the market for a really good RPG review show.

But for me, creepy has proved to be a bit more effective without requiring as much buy in. Two of the best examples that have stuck to me I found on Reddit, and I really wish I could give credit where it's due, if I'd remembered who said them.

1. Someone describes an aasimar's appearance to someone. ""Mithra turns to regard you. All of her eyes twinkling.""

""Wait, uh...*all* of her eyes? I take a closer look. How many eyes she got?

""...Two. :)""

2. A party of four finds an inn, one that's fairly quiet, with only a few other patrons. The lively innkeep describes the rooms, the cost for each. ""Right then. So will you be splitting it between the five of you?""

""You mean four.""

The innkeep nods at a space behind the party. They turn---nothing is there. ""Oh right sorry, haha, I meant four. Think someone's here a little too mischievous with illusion magic!"" Bonus points if the party has just come back from exploring a wizard's tower or an undead crypt.

*I love the idea of being so committed to the rules and story that even though you don't want to, you follow through on the fiction and kill NPC


*I loved being surprised and improvising based on what the PC did


*It was harder than I thought. I had a struggle to not railroad the players while providing enough structure


*It was harder than I thought. How much content to put in was a struggle


*It was harder than I thought. Pacing peaked early as novelty wore off, then it felt like a slog


*It was easier than I thought. I planned a lot, but you can only plan some. The unplanned parts were the best


*I liked inventing rules, settings, and templates for people to use


*Creativity loves constraint. Some things need to be off limits to let the players invent creatively


*One shots allow more creativity as there are no lasting consequences for failure


*I thought that the one shots that were the most fun had more structure. With a background in improvisation I thought I could do it all on the fly, but it turned out I didn't have enough. I'll prepare more next time",rpg,1623340005.0,0,1459,268

&#x200B;

For a long time on /r/LFG there have been GMs who are serial ghosters.  It used to be that users of the sub would call out these kinds of GMs whenever they posted an ad, so that they didn't screw over newbies, since the mods didn't seem to care.

&#x200B;

A little while ago, the mods took it to a whole different level.  They're now banning people who call out the ghosters, so the ghosters are just getting away with it.

&#x200B;

It would be nice to talk about this on /r/LFG itself, but the mods posted a locked sticky which says that not only do they refuse to debate the issue, but if you try it, they'll ban you.  [You can read it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/hzho65/regarding_our_policy_on_ghosting_and_our_policy/)  So here I am on /r/RPG.

&#x200B;

The LFG mods are claiming that calling out ghosters is targetted harassment.  It's not.  Here's the Reddit policy on harassment

&#x200B;

>Being annoying, downvoting, or disagreeing with someone, even strongly, is not harassment. However, menacing someone, directing abuse at a person or group, following them around the site, encouraging others to do any of these actions, or otherwise behaving in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit crosses the line.

&#x200B;

No one is being menacing.  No one is directing abuse.  (People are posting messages that say to check out the GM's post history.)  No one is following them around the site.  (People **are** watching for them on LFG, but there's nothing wrong with that, according to the rules.)  No one is encouraging others to do these things.

&#x200B;

Does it discourage reasonable people from participating?  Depends on what your definition of reasonable is, I guess.  To me, someone who is just here to ruin other people's day by ghosting them isn't really a reasonable person.  The people who are there to actually use the sub are fine, and they deserve better moderation than just being thrown to the wolves.

&#x200B;

So I guess I'm asking whether there's anyway to get the mods of /r/LFG to go back to being useless instead of being Dolores Umbridges?  It would be great if they would actually **do** something, but if they aren't then I wish they would just let the community police itself and not go after the people who are trying to help.",rpg,1596824484.0,0,2475,414
340,607,5w2r2m,Session report! I was recruited to run a D&D game night for a bunch of tweenagers at my son's school.,"So my son's school was having a ""lock-in"" tonight, which is basically a ""drop your kids off and we'll watch them until 10pm while the parents go have a date night"" event, and like a fool, I allowed myself to get roped into helping out by running a session of *Dungeons and Dragons* for a gaggle of tweenagers instead of going on a date night with my wife.

Here's a session report.

I had no idea how many kids were going to be playing.  I knew it would be at least two, since my son and one of his friends had conscripted me, but there was no known upper bound on the number of players.  It was also extremely likely that I would have players who were completely new to *Dungeons and Dragons*.  And to top it off, the amount of time we'd have to play was uncertain - somewhere between one and three hours.

So, rather than playing D&D, I decided to kitbash [*Sidekick Quests*](http://sidekickquests.com/learn-the-game/) to make the introduction easy.  *Sidekick Quests* is a very simple but effective RPG system designed for very young kids, and it has the virtue of having just about the entire game system embedded on your character sheet, and being dead simple to learn.  This is exactly what I needed.  The down side is that it's way too juvenile for my target audience, better geared for second graders than seventh graders.  For instance, the example quests involve going to a field and picking magic flowers or babysitting infant owlbears.  They're adorable and effective for the right audience, but it would not have flown for these kids.

But with some changes to the powers and other flavor text, I was able to pull forward that system to a more age-appropriate level.  I basically translated the typical D&D archetypes into the *Sidekick Quests* system, substituting things like talking to animals and finding useful things on the map with backstab and rebuking undead.  I also borrowed the concept of ""awesome points"" and ""hitting them in the *face*"" from [*Old School Hack*](http://www.oldschoolhack.net).

It's a good thing that I made several copies of the characters, because when the time came to play, I had **nine** kids gathered around the table wanting to play!  Yikes!  I wasn't about to turn any kid away, though, so we plunged right in.

Luckily, the *Sidekick Quest* system runs like a dream, and is super fast.  On their turn, the player moves, says what they want to do, and you say, ""Okay, are you tough enough?"" or ""Okay, are you smart enough?""  Right there on their character sheet, it says, ""When asked if you are tough enough, roll d20 + 5"" or something similar.  They roll, you choose a target number, and that's it.  The kids picked it up immediately, and each turn zipped by.  Even with the typical tweenager antics and nine players to get through per round, the game moved very quickly.

It was very chaotic and loud, however.  Much talking and shouting, but that is to be expected from the age group.  As the evening wore on, however, players got more focused on the game, and it ran more and more smoothly as they got into the rhythm of how it all works.

We played for about three hours, minus two breaks, and got a full adventure with three combat scenes in.  It started with the players stumbling upon some animated scarecrows attempting to abduct a little girl from a nearby village.  After dispatching them and saving the girl, the heroes went into the town and got some sleep, and then convened with the town elder in the morning.  He suspected that the culprit was a necromancer who moved into an old tower twenty years before and began reanimating the town's loved ones from the graveyard.  The townsfolk rose up and burned the tower to the ground, and the necromancer along with it, but not before the necromancer vowed revenge.

The heroes then headed towards the tower.  They set up a base camp outside the tower, and had to fight some more scarecrows outside the tower which had emerged to go abduct more townsfolk.  Entering the tower, they found the bodies of the missing townsfolk strewn about a hidden basement that had largely survived the fire.  Hovering over them was a mystical wisp that animated the corpses to attack when the PCs arrived.  A heated battle broke out, and eventually, the PCs destroyed all the corpses and robbed the wisp of its power, defeating the necromancer once and for all.

Because of parents coming, we had several kids have to leave mid-game, but as quickly as kids left, we picked up other kids from the crowd.  We had spectators as well as players.  Several kids stuck with it from beginning to end (minus forays to fetch pizza and other necessities), and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  We did get a few of the older ""cool"" kids from the school sticking their heads in and shouting ""nerds"", but to their credit, not a single one of my players seemed even remotely fazed by it.  The fun continued without a blip.  (And by the end of the evening, one of the kids that had called them nerds was one of our spectators!)

I let the players keep their character sheets, and I had bought a fistful of d20's to give out, so each kid got to go home with their own d20.  My motive here was to give them the tools to continue the games without me at school - the way *Sidekick Quest* is structured, that's really all they need to play, and it will be a breeze for a kid to pick up as referee.  I'll probably write up some adventures in the *Sidekick Quest* style, too, to give them, to help the process along.

Most of the kids thanked me for running the game, they stayed after to help clean up, and I hear that they asked the principal there if they could start a D&D club at the school.  And on the way home, my son asked me to teach him how to be a DM.

Overall, I'd say the evening was a *geek dad win.*

341,608,py585d,Stop getting the GM to deal with personal player issues for you,"Repeatedly on this subreddit and in the RPG scene in general I see a false idea that if a player has a problem with another player, they should ask the GM to deal with it, there is a false sense that because the GM has added authority in gameplay they have the same in personal issues between players. **It is completely unfair to make it the GM's responsibility to deal with personal problems for you, as they do not actually have more authority on personal issues than anyone else.**

*Some common examples include:*

\- Two Players having an argument? Its up to the GM to mediate it

\- One player using language or jokes another doesn't approve of? The GM has to be the one to ask them to stop

\- One player is a fucking creep? The GM has to be the one to ask them to leave, not because they are most comfortable doing so but purely because they are the GM.

\- A GM has to pick sides between two players? They have to undergo the stress of that, without sharing it out between the group.

In NONE of these situations should one player do nothing, for instance **if one player is acting in a creepy way to another the player that feels uncomfortable should not stay silent,** but they should come to the group with the issue, as it's unfair to put the pressure of dealing with a pretty stressful situation all on any one person (does anyone ever consider the GM may feel vulnerable confronting someone who they may also find intimidating or creepy?). In a similar vein, if you are frustrated with of another player (this could be you find their humour juvenile, or playstyle annoying), don't expect the GM to tell them it's annoying for you, tell them yourself, because you're just jeprodizing the GM's relationship with that other player you find annoying.

Something complicating this is the fact if the GM alone is approached they may feel they have to make the decision(s) involved alone because they've been asked, and they may feel they're failing their players by not acting alone, so the GM ends up being pressured into solving the problem whether or not it's right for them to do so alone.

Automatically expecting the GM to deal with personal issues just because they have higher authority on the gameplay leads to GM's having to pick sides, endanger friendships, deal with stressful situations on their own, or act on behalf of an entire group of people when only they have been consulted, and nobody would ever put this expectation on someone in a normal social situation.",rpg,1632951124.0,0,2489,445
342,610,lu25uz,"Has D&D changed, or was I playing it wrong as a kid?","My teenage kids have engaged us in playing D&D; they've both been playing over Zoom with their friends (pandemic, sigh), and they thought it would be fun to start up a campaign with us as well. So the older one is DM; the other one is a player along with me and mom.

The last time I played D&D at all, really, was back in the early 1980s, when I was their age or younger. We had played with the basic set, with the blue dragon on the cover. My memory of the experience is entirely different from what I'm seeing now. I'm curious as to whether the game has dramatically changed, whether we had no idea what we were doing way back when, or whether it's a difference in playing style.

My memory of playing BD&D a gazillion years ago with the neighborhood kids was that we did purely dungeon crawls. We were using the modules that came with the set and then a couple of others we bought at the nearby hobby shop, and they all provided a detailed gridded layout of the dungeon / tomb / whatever that the DM could see. The DM would lay out a blank piece of graph paper on the table, and as the players explored, the DM would carefully draw out bit by bit the layout from the module within the range of what the characters could expect to see (dim lighting, etc). So in principle, if we explored everything, which we never succeeded at doing, we'd end up with an exact replica on the graph paper of what was in the module.

So my memory of the experience as a tween/young teen player was that we'd spend a lot of time looking at that paper. There would be a door at the end of the corridor, and then the DM would stop drawing there. We would break open the door, and then the DM would draw the intersection beyond. If there were monsters there, the DM might put a small mark with a pencil indicating where they were, and so on. Occasionally the DM would screw up transcribing the map --- which we'd discover when a passage looped back to where we had previously been, perhaps --  and so the DM would go back and erase and fix some stuff. Etc.

Anyway, now the kids have us playing modern D&D. The rules changes in rolling dice to make a character, e.g., aren't surprising or weird to me: it's a new edition, details change. What is surprising to me is how it seems like an entirely different experience. There's no graph paper at all or even a dungeon. Instead, my elder kid as DM is describing a walk across the countryside, purely verbally telling us what we see. Though he has some basic ideas as to where we're going, he's clearly making a whole lot of it up as he goes as well. Instead of working out details on how to get around a dungeon and fiddling with lines on paper, everything is just talked out. And of course, dice are rolled, and a few stats are updated.

It feels to me as though we're playing an entirely different game than the one I remember. I could raise a host of questions relating to which is more enjoyable, but I'll put that aside for the moment.  I'm mostly just extremely curious: is this just a difference in style? Are there people who play D&D today the way I describe above? Or is that how people (or at least some people) used to play, and the game has changed? Or, did the kids in my neighborhood have no idea what they were doing, and we weren't really playing (B)D&D at all the way it was meant to be played?",rpg,1614475548.0,0,3340,637

Started a Curse of Strahd campaign, just about everyone died in the death house. Everyone decided to play Call of Cthulhu after that and the GM stopped the game because everyone in the group was basically murder hoboing everything. 

I tried the second time last night with a game of Mouse Guard. I used Startplaying.games to schedule the session. It was basically bare minimum effort. Everything was ""theatre of the mind"", the GM wanted the party to basically handle everything and the rules were completely loose with the phases basically being abandoned. Nothing was described, there was like 1 or 2 NPC's in 2 major towns (no names, descriptions, pictures, etc.) and we basically completed the mission in 1 sitting.

I tried the third time today. Sessions is scheduled for 6PM EST. I used startplaying.games and everything was on there, scheduled for 6PM. The GM and I were messaging on Discord today about making characters and then all of a sudden, I get an alert on Discord that the game is from 2PM-6PM EST. I check Startplaying.games and the session is gone, no way for me to verify anything. I let the people in the Discord server know that the bump up time wouldn't work for me due to prior commitments, the guy in the wait-list could take my spot and the GM bans me from the server and ignores my messages

I cannot stand this mindset of pay to play, but put in bare minimum effort, not know the rules, etc. If I'm paying you good money (and some of these sessions are $20+ bucks each so that's almost $100 a month to play a game) to run a game, I expect their to be an attempt at production value, content, quality, etc. It feels like because of the explosion of TTRPG's due to COVID that this is a new ""side hustle"" and irritates the piss out of me.

I was imagining some shriveled creature that hides in a cave and mulls over ancient texts for centuries at a time, akin to the excessively bureaucratic [Vogons](https://youtu.be/IxPeIiU2kx4) from *Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy*.

So you can imagine my surprise when I googled the term and found out they were the name of the [Imperial Guard of Napoleon I](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grognard).

I thought it may have been a coincidence at first, but then I realized that D&D has its origins in classical wargaming, which often set battles *during* the Napoleonic era, where a grognard was very likely an actual unit to be played, and that these soldiers themselves were often the aging *old guard* comprised of highly experienced veterans.

I don't know when the term was first applied in the context we're familiar with, but it struck me as funny that the term itself may have possibly been applied to aging grumpy nerds all the way back in the days of *Chainmail* before D&D was even a thing. Maybe even self-applied!

349,624,yyigtk,Transformers rpg is honestly kind of heartbreaking [rant],"So I finally got my physical copy of the Transformers RPG last week after pre-ordering it back in February. I was fully aware of what it would be: a kind of low-effort 5E hack with slightly different terminology. But I was fine with that, I rarely run games RAW so I was prepared to tweak and hack and house rule. I figured that there'd be a decent skeleton to work with. Plus I love Transformers: I'm not just some GeeWun nostalgia blinded casual fan, I've kept pace with the franchise for years and love both the deep lore and the great potential for storytelling the franchise has.

I thought it would be *fine.*

But to paraphrase Prime from the banging Cybertron theme, OUR GAMES ARE IN DANGER

(disclaimer, this is all my opinion, if you like the Essence system/5E, good for you, my dislike doesn't invalidate your preferences)

Firstly this book is just a mess in terms of layout. You have to get about 120 pages in before it starts actually explaining rules, so chances are you waded through a bunch of character stuff with zero context for what any of it means. Then usual bloat of more character options and combat rules. Then 80ish pages of enemy statblocks. You want advice how to actually structure and run a game? Here's like four paragraphs they vaguely talk about doing an equal mix of combat, exploration, and social interaction. OKAY COOL THANKS CHAMP.

Alt mode rules aren't awful. I was dreading this but they make the smart choice of generalising vehicle types. But ffs some of the language/terminology choice is so bad. Your alt mode is your ""Origin""? A tank alt mode is a ""Rainmaker""? Oh and no rules for beast modes. We can apparently have a fifth of the book be statblocks but can't have dedicate a page for covering beast mode alt modes - sorry, Origin - rules. Got to have something for the supplemental books I guess.

Characters are just 5E copy paste jobs. 20 levels, with multiple small perks because that's what D&D does so we should do it too! 👍 The list of skills is the same. Why the fuck does my Transformers game have Animal Handling and Performance skills in it? Going to be rolling lots of acting checks are we? Is that the intended tone for the game? I have to guess because the GM advice is aggressively minimal. 

I have a bunch of other gripes but I just wanted to get all that out now. Honestly stay away from this one, it's a wreck. But not the cool Wreck 'N' Rule type, the bad kind. 

The good thing is that it's inspired me to start writing my own game based on Unity's ruleset as I think that fits Transformers better.",rpg,1668773026.0,0,2567,467

Been playing Pathfinder 2e since my current group swapped fron DnD 5e about 4 years ago, but I've been playing TTRPG'S pretty consistently for the last 10 years with a couple of groups, and I started thinking - Almost anywhere there's bad guys, we kill them. All of them. We leave a god damn wake of corpses every where we go. I have tried to reason with villains multiple times on this alone saying we will fucking kill you, and we will win, nobody has stopped us yet, and you won't get lucky. I know it would probably be lame to just have an encounter end there, but I'm being dead serious, and I don't know how else to point this out to our enemies that the numbers are not in their favor here.

 Sparing is just a lot of the times not an option, because of some combination of the following:

1. The creature is physically or mentally incapable of understanding the party
2. The creature is turbo evil and decides that the succulent taste of human flesh outweighs any concept of morality.
3. Non lethal options are not available and/or the creature fights to the death
4. We have no means of ensuring that they do not hurt anyone else after combat outside of...
5. Our most common means of ensuring they do not hurt anyone else means turning around to make a 4 day trek back to town to take 3 orcs in as prisoners... where the town shortly thereafter has a very strong chance to have them executed.

Like, holy shit. You kill so many people it feels like sometimes. Oh my god. There is no way this doesn't attract psychopaths left and right as a means of getting a license to murder, and then getting praised for it. You can play LE characters that just love killing people and nobody would suspect a thing so long as  you only target your ballistic warhead of a character at groups of people hated.

I'm glad this got a lot of attention to kind of say it explicitly - and I do think it's something I've kind of sub consciously worked into my campaigns I've run in the past with about a 60/40 split between combat and non combat encounters, and establishing both as being high stakes and meaningful, and having enemies be reasonable enough to surrender and cooperate with players from disadvantaged positions sometimes even.

1. [Trail of Cthulhu](https://bundleofholding.com/store/Trail)

*Trail of Cthulhu* is a complete game of investigative horror set in the 1930s based on the work of H.P. Lovecraft. The game uses an adapted and enlarged version of GUMSHOE, a rules system that offers a laser-like focus on investigation and encourages characters driven to explore and investigate, even at the expense of their own health and sanity.

* *Sanity* measures your blissful ignorance of the true nature of reality, and *Stability* defines your mental health.
* Investigative abilities such as Cop Talk, Interrogation, and Occult help you find the awful crypt and maybe even tell you what you might find there; Drives such as *In the Blood* and *Arrogance* compel your character into that crypt at night; and General abilities such as Sense Trouble, Filch, and Scuffling get you out again.
* Tune the rules for Purist cosmic despair or lurid two-gun Pulp.
* This core rulebook includes three exciting campaign frames (tweedy academics, jut-jawed G-Men, and grimy traffickers in the eldritch) plus ""The Kingsbury Horror,"" a complete introductory adventure

2. [Soth: A game of Cultists vs. Investigators](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/163649/Soth-a-game-of-cultists-vs-investigators)

In *Soth*, you play cultists in a small-town, trying to summon a dark god. If you complete three more rituals, Soth will rise. But can you conceal your murderous crimes from family and friends?

It's a noir thriller that uses a diceless system to evaluate how suspicious the cultists are being. You then spend 'Suspicion' to put the cultists under pressure.

3.  [Cthulhu Dark](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/341997/Cthulhu-Dark)

""Cthulhu Dark is a tabletop roleplaying game of cosmic horror, in the style of H.P. Lovecraft.

It's about the things we fear, amplified until they are unbearable. It's about stories that genuinely creep you out, not well-worn tropes and creatures you've seen hundreds of times before.

And it's about bleak horror, in which humans are powerless when confronted by hyperintelligent alien horrors. You can't beat them. You can't fight them. You can only watch, run, hide and fear.

The rules are incredibly short: they're tightly focussed on horror and they drive the game.""

(From the DTrpg page)

4. [Kult: Divinity Lost](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/259252/Kult-Divinity-Lost--4th-Edition-of-Kult-Core-Rules)

In KULT: Divinity Lost, the world around us is a lie. Mankind is trapped in an Illusion. We do not see the great citadels of Metropolis towering over our highest skyscrapers. We do not hear the screams from the forgotten cellar where hidden stairs take us to Inferno. We do not smell the blood and burnt flesh from those sacrificed to long forgotten Gods. But some of us see glimpses from beyond the veil. We have this strange feeling that something is not right—the ramblings of a madman in the subway seems to carry a hidden message, and, when thinking about it, our reclusive neighbor doesn’t appear to be completely human when we pass in the hallway. By slowly discovering the truth about our prison, our captors, and our hidden pasts, we can finally awaken from our induced sleep and take control of our destiny.

**5. Delta Green**

*Born of the U.S. government’s 1928 raid on the coastal town of Innsmouth, Massachusetts, the covert agency known as Delta Green spent four decades opposing the forces of darkness with honor, but without glory. Stripped of sanction after a disastrous 1969 operation in Cambodia, Delta Green’s leaders made a secret pact: to continue their work without authority, without support, and without fear. Delta Green agents slip through the system, manipulating the federal bureaucracy while pushing the darkness back for another day—but often at a shattering personal cost.*

In *Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game,* you are one of those agents. You’re the one they call when unnatural horrors seep into the world. You fight to keep cosmic evil from claiming human lives and sanity. You conspire to cover it all up so no one else must see what you’ve seen—or learn the terrible truths you’ve discovered.

6. [Cthulhu Deep Green](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/295770/Cthulhu-Deep-Green?term=Cthulhu+Deep+Green)

Building upon the groundwork set out in Cthulhu Dark by Graham Walmsley, Cthulhu Deep Green contains modified rules set for playing as Agents of The Conspiracy: a shadowy government agency tasked with concealing evidence of the supernatural.

With a focus on quick setup and improvisational campaign play, the rules of Cthulhu Deep Green are designed to focus the human element while keeping the action tense and dramatic.

What will your agent give up to protect the public from terrors beyond sense or reason?

**7. Unkown Armies**

 *An occult game about broken people conspiring to fix the world.* 

*Unknown Armies* presents magick as it might exist in a world informed by crime fiction and secret histories, as twisting wrinkles in reality created by greater and greater risk, sacrifice, and obsession. **As a player,** you are confronted by the consequences of your character's actions and challenged by the implicit threat of a world shaped by the will of those who want something more than you do. 

*Book One: Play* is the book for players. It details:

* Obsession and identity.
* All of the rules for resolving actions.
* The central shock gauge mechanic.
* How to avoid fights, and how to deal with them when you're dragged into them anyway.
* The magick of adepts and avatars.

**8.  Never Going Home**

Never Going Home is a party-focused role-playing game set in horror haunted trenches during the First World War.

*Party-Focused:* Never Going Home uses the +One System to focus play and growth on what an individual character can do as part of the larger story that follows a group of soldiers called a Unit. Individual characters may depart regularly as they die from injuries or collapse into madness due to forces from beyond the Veil. Characters are quick to create, so players should expect to re-join the story portraying a new member of the Unit. Each character can have their own heroic moments, but the story of the Unit is the focus.  


*Horror-Haunted:* The Veil between worlds has been opened by the slaughter from the war; and the monstrous Whispers of beings wholly alien to humanity can now be heard. Some people have listened to the Whispers enough to gain arcane powers and now struggle to maintain control as their minds and bodies begin to change. Others are too far gone, mutated into barely-recognizable versions of their former selves. War consumes the days and monsters stalk the nights. Not even dreams are  
safe. Players manage their characters’ mental and emotional resources with a dwindling hand of cards.  


*The First World War:* The setting is the real Earth and the characters are all humans. A terrible new element has been added to the war, but the true horrors of the real war are part of the story as well. The game is set in the years between when the Veil was torn in 1916 and when the war really ended in 1918. The focus is on the front-line soldiers who are fighting and experiencing the worst of the magic and monsters. There is some mention made of, but little exploration of, the “home fronts” of any of the belligerents and civilians only appear in passing.",rpg,1644623034.0,0,7683,1225

I’m always trying to think of problems that aren’t necessarily a monster, but something that looks like a small inconvenience, but ends up wrecking a place. Think about if a well gets poisoned. Ugh. Terrible. No source of potable water.

**But what if you could strip basic stuff from your setting that had major consequences that no one thought of?** 

Example: In this city and three miles out, fire doesn’t work all of a sudden. You can’t light a candle, torch, or anything. Oh, you try and cast a spell that has fire? Nope. Nothing. At night, the place is pitch black. Crime goes up. City watch is overwhelmed. People are panicked. A troll got into the city (they are hurt more by fire.) Something has to be done. But here are some of the hooks:

* Even more trolls show up. They somehow know that fire doesn’t work.
* The clerics that serve the deity of fire are sick or missing. Their entire chapel is gone as if it was never built.
* Perhaps the city has been shuttered (no one has left the city and no one has entered it).
* The mage tower that is miles away has a torrent of fire reaching up into the sky. Saddle up. 

Try taking an inconvenience and then stretching it out to a huge, huge problem. It’s easier than you think. (Metal starts rusting at a rapid rate. . . . Ooooooh.)

If you have a space game: somehow the form of travel around a certain planet has winked out. Everyone is stranded there. What’s hampering the ability to “warp out”? . . Or whatever your game calls it.

358,638,8zah52,"Unpopular opinion: I feel that traditional RPGs lead to stories that actually feel ""earned"", moreso than story games like PbtA/FATE","I'm not going to pretend like I'm an expert at narrative games, I DMed a selection with a varying number of play, so far I've run: Lady Blackbird, Dungeon World, Monster of the Week, FATE Accelerated, Monsterhearts (once and I prolly fucked it up), Undying, Apocalypse World 2e and Urban Shadows. Coming from DnD 5e I've wrenched myself from the usual trad rpg mindset and went to the ""play to find out what happens"" mentality that PbtA encourages in play. Even then I know there's still a lot of the philosophy to practice. However there was something that really bothered me, and that something pushed me to go back to 5e and now I wanna learn either SotDL or Pathfinder. I may not articulate it well but I'll try.
&nbsp

That something? It just feels like narrative games have so many moments that feel so inauthentic. Playing PbtA the general resolution mechanic is the 2d6 system (2 to 6 fails, 7 to 9 partial success, 10+ success), it helps speed play since it's so simple but at the same time it's so *general*. Moves flavor the game but the core is still core, and despite the chance for failure it feels less like thinking around the rules and more making a story. And that's probably the thing that irks me, as wonderful as story collaboration is it feels less like a game and more of a scriptwriting/acting session.
&nbsp;

I had thoughts of it before but I dismissed it as me probably just getting used to it. The pivotal moment was when one player said while we were playing DW that he wanted to ""jump down from the roof onto a building wall and wallrun towards the target and throw a dagger to cut down a rope holding up a street sign"". I was feeling kinda proud cos he was one of the skeptics who at first didn't understand how different DW was from DnD and I told him that players are encouraged to string actions together like in a movie, also that he gets to structure and materialize objects the world because it's collaborative. I made him roll for Defy Danger and then for Volley, both of which he got hard successes thanks to his dex.
&nbsp;

Afterwards we got to talking, I commended him on adapting but he goes on saying that he didn't feel like he earned it. He says that while it did feel like a cool scene he felt that he was badass as a Thief because he wanted to be, not because he actually was. His character wall-ran just because he said so and the sign existed because he said it was there, not because he rolled a good acrobatics check or because the sign was actually in a set environment I made. He compared it to the one time he was a Monk in 5e where everyone except him in the party was down vs 3 animated knights, he was down to one ki point but still managed to win via smart options, the environment (he brought a statue down on a knight) and a Nat20. 
&nbsp;

Despite the limitations of 5e compared to Dungeon World's freedom, that scene will be cooler and more hard-earned than any boss battle in a freeform story system. He was a clutch Monk because he did so and not because he said so. Behind the fixed HP, the somewhat rigid structure of the battlegrid, the mechanics was a chance to tell a story of a Monk who saved his party from death. Despite the chance of a partial success/fail, the walls of an AC to hit or an opportunity attack to risk was far more interesting to scale. That gave me pause.
&nbsp;

We still continued to play DW and Urban Shadows for a few more sessions, but eventually we went back to 5e and now eyeing Shadows of the Demon Lord, Pathfinder and 13th Age for new systems to try out. The group opened up and said and felt the same, and I find that we were happier making stories in less narrative and more crunchier systems. Rather than letting the act of pushing a story forward, the story happens organically as a result and byproduct of what we do in-game. 
&nbsp;

I'm not saying narrative games are bad, in the end it's up to what people prefer and how people go find their rpg fix. It's just that after some exploration I find that story games don't necessarily have the best stories as opposed to games without supporting mechanics.

370,655,10pfx6g,I finally have to admit that OSR just isn’t for me,"I’ve had a fascination with the idea of OSR for a while now, but every attempt at getting into the actual games has been like bashing my head against a brick wall. Old School Essentials just feels like an overcomplicated mess. The Into The Odds and Mörk Borgs feel like empty skeletons. Every game I’ve looked at just leaves me feeling disappointed. And I think I’ve figured out why.

AD&D was my very first roleplaying game, but I always felt like I was fighting the system when I played it. I didn’t know of any alternatives, so I stuck with it until D&D 3e came out, and then I stuck with that until I discovered other games.

Over the years, I’ve read, played and picked apart tons of games. I was very engaged with the ideas and community surrounding The Forge and that school of game design, and in the years since then I’ve found that my niche in the rpg world is narrative, story-driven roleplaying games that offer systems and structure to support specific kinds of stories.

I’ve had this idea that OSR games offered that kind of structure in an indirect sort of way, by encouraging a type of gameplay based on improvisation and creative problem solving, while providing a framework for running an open-world style game centred around exploration and discovery, which it absolutely does.  
But for me, personally, it’s the wrong kind of framework. This became painfully obvious to me when I bought and read Into The Odd. I was very disappointed by it, because the book told me it was a game about weird, surreal adventures in a strange and hostile world, but what I found when I read it was a bare bones rpg system and nothing else. All the surreal weirdness was in the form of a few simple examples, and the game tells the GM to supply everything else without any support structure baked into the game at all.  
Theres nothing wrong with that, but it just doesn’t work for me. And that made me realize that to me, all OSR games are like that, and the entire OSR design philosophy feels kinda based around it.

The OSR style of design is trying to replicate a style of play that I have no nostalgia for, and that doesn’t work for me or provide what I want out of a roleplaying game.

And thats ok.  
It’s not for me, but I get the appeal. I’ve read about how rpgs were played in the early days, and how expectations and goals were very different. I can totally see how playing in one of those games would have been fun, and I know which parts of that style were discarded and which were brought forward into later games and design philosophies.  
It’s just not very appealing to me. And, again, thats ok.",rpg,1675117150.0,0,2614,477

372,657,hv68b7,How much were gold coins really worth during the middle ages,"Just read an interesting article on [How much were gold coins really worth during the middle ages](https://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2020/03/18/how-much-were-gold-coins-really-worth-during-the-middle-ages/)

TL;DR its not easy to make a comparison as the economies are so radically different,  one Byzantine nomisma (bgp, 4.4g gold) had the purchasing power of about $400 (one pig) OTOH it was just over a months pay for a construction worker (\~$4000). 

I suspect that the latter figure is the more realistic, industrial methods have vastly reduced the cost of goods and materials. I think living standards may be the more relatable way to look at the value of gold in past times, something like 52g (12bgp)  would be enough for one person (maybe a family?) to live for a year ($48,000) in very modest comfort.

Looking to more modern times 

I also came across [www.victorianlondon.org](http://www.victorianlondon.org/index-2012.htm) with some interesting notes about [money](https://www.victorianlondon.org/finance/money.htm). This pegged a labourer at \~£40/year which is 290g (65bgp).

Getting interested I found [Lindert.pdf](http://www.nws-sa.com/rr/Inequality/Lindert.pdf) which has a table of Occupation annual pay (in £ = 1 sovereign = 7.3g pure gold) 

     Occupation 1755 1781 1797 1805 1810 1815 1819 1827 1835 1851 
     colliers   23   24   47   65   63   57   50   54   56   55  

So in the 18th and 19th coal miner would be earning 39-95bgp/year

[5th Ed](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Expenses#content) says a poor living standard is 2sp/day = 37(d&d)gp  = 308g gold = 70bgp/year 

So the bottom line is that D&D currency may be more comparable to prices during the Industrial revolution (in Briton) than the medieval period and you could use Victorian era catalogues to set equipment prices (£1 = 1gp would be roughly right).

Don’t dictate, elaborate instead.

The game of life is hard to play, but it always takes precedence.

Rule Zero AKA The Rule of Cool AKA DM Caveat is a tool, not a weapon.

You must be the PC’s biggest fan and cheerleader. You do not exist as a pure adversary but rather as a challenge or teacher.

Any conflict must result in growth. 

Progress is measured not in time, space, or levels but in friendship and glory.

DO NOT TRY TO WIN THE GAME

Patience, patience, patience. 

Players can’t read minds. 

If PC’s struggle, step in. If PC’s walk with ease, step in. Be active. 

Spotlight control begins and ends with you.

PC’s must never be aware of the safety net. 

Heroes sometimes die. Idiots always die. 

Do not punish so much as teach. 

Do not hate them for their foibles but do not forget them.

Do not be too fond of a joke if said joke has teeth and murderous intent. 

If you are asked for advice, give it earnestly and without complaint. 

Hang on to good players with zeal. 

Dump bad players like rotten fish.

An honest accounting should be done to ensure everyone has time to play weaponized pretend.

384,676,46lb8f,I just pulled off my best gotcha ever as a GM,"The campaign just ended last night, and I'm really proud of myself and wanted to share.  The arc of the campaign focused on the players trying to find the reason why the world was slowly fragmenting.  

After some running around, fighting some pirates, surviving the odd assassination attempt, and other typical D&D activities, the players somewhat unexpectedly come upon the Lich King, imprisoned at the bottom of a dungeon after being betrayed and overthrown by his own lieutenants some 500 years before.  The Lich King had long been assumed to have been the perpetrator of the fragmenting, but, he gleefully informs them, this is not the case.  The *last* thing he wants is for the world to be fragmented, because then he can't *conquer* it.  In fact, he continues, it's the Wizard-King of their own nation that's behind it all.  Their Wizard-King is so fearful of being overrun by enemies that he is willing to break the world apart in order to keep his country safe from anything that might harm it.  

So the players have an oh-shit moment, because this suddenly crystallizes a lot of details that up till now hadn't really made a lot of sense.  This is quickly followed by the sinking realization that the BBEG they are going to have to face is not only one of the most powerful men in existence, but one of their own countrymen.  [Note: The players specifically requested a gritty campaign with tough moral choices, so I gave it to them.]

Well, the Lich King says, I could transform you into some serious undead, and you'd be more powerful.  Powerful enough to take him on directly, yourselves.

The players say no.  One of them is tempted ... but no.

Okay, how about freeing me, then? the Lich King offers.  I would help you kill your Wizard-King, and I will give you my word that I wouldn't invade your nation ... at least until I'd conquered everything else.

The players say that it sounds tempting, but no.  We're going to have to try to find another epic power to ally ourselves with.  Someone safer.

The Lich King sighs.  Okay, well, he says, would you like an emissary of mine in case you need to corroborate your story?  The Lich King beckons and this ancient, decrepit ghoul shuffles forward.

The players say okay.

So for the next half dozen sessions, they haul this gimpy zombie-thing along with them, while gathering forces to confront the Wizard-King.  It never proves useful, but my players never throw anything away.  *Ever.*  So finally the showdown comes: fireballs are thrown, royal guards make ferocious last stands, and at last the Wizard-King falls to the floor, defeated and dying.

At which point the broken-ass ghoul they'd been carrying around hulks the fuck out.  No longer a broke, limping, ancient undead, it is now an 8-ft tall incarnation of murderdeath.  It starts walking toward the broken body of the Wizard King, ignoring everything else around it.  The players realize that it's going to siphon power from the Wizard-King and allow the Lich King to break free, and they are just about out of spells and healing potions.

At which point, I am smiling about the biggest smile I've ever smiled.  ""Really, guys?"" I say, pulling out the stat sheet for the monster.  ""You cut a deal with one of the most evil creatures in all of creation, and you didn't think he was going to betray you?  MUAHAHAHAHA.""

But it occurs to me that lots of people stick with TTRPGs precisely because, to them, it's a low-cost low-time investment hobby. What do you need to be a player? Maybe a core book and a set of dice? Your own miniature if you're super into your character? Some hardcore players might look down on them, but I think you really need these kinds of low-investment players to fill out the ranks and keep any TTRPG healthy in the long run.

And while your casual video game player might drop $3 here and $5 there on in-app purchases and have that add up over time without them even realizing it, are most casual players really going to do that for a tabletop game that they *might* get to play for five hours twice a month? Are they even going to log into WotC's app when it's not time for their game? There's not instant gratification of getting new items or an XP boost as in DLC for an actual video game that they can play whenever and for however long they want.

PS - I'm aware that many people here don't like DND, but I'm surprised by how many here seem to be completely \*uninterested\* in what the next edition will bring. Because as the single biggest game in the hobby by a wide margin, what happens with DnD will have knock-on effects for the rest of the industry, for better or worse.

I don't play 5e myself, but I am interested in the future of the hobby overall, will a rising tide lift all boats, as 5e seems to have done with interest for the hobby? If predatory monetization works for WotC, will other large TTRPG companies follow suit? (Remembering Chaosium jumping on NFTs.) If the next iteration of DnD  flounders, will this lead to an influx of players trying other games as an alternative, or will the playerbase dry up as the standard gateway game fails to garner new recruits for the hobby?",rpg,1672619990.0,0,2005,366

The story swept across the Internet with no small number of opinions flying around about the merits of the suit, the *Dragonlance* setting, the *Dragonlance* novels, and Weis/Hickman themselves.

The Venn Diagram of lawyers and people who write about tabletop games is basically two circles with very little overlap. For the three of us who exist at the center, though, this was exciting news (Yes, much as I am loathe to talk about it, I have a law degree and I still use it from time to time). 

Weis and Hickman are arguably the most famous D&D novel authors next to R.A. Salvatore, the creator of Drizzt Do’Urden, so it's unusual to see them be so publicly at odds with Wizards of the Coast.

I’m going to try to break this case down and explain it in a way that makes sense for non-lawyers. This is a bit of a tall order—most legal discussions are terminally boring—but I’m going to do my level best. This is probably going to be a bit of a long one, so if you're interested, strap in.

390,683,1c1mtnq,I told my group I'm burnt out on dnd 5e during our over 2 years campaign. This is how it went.,"Recently I asked for tips on how to tell my 5e group that I am burnt out on dnd 5e as a system and our years long campaign in [this post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1bwsrky/tips_for_breaking_to_my_players_im_done_with_out/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

When I read such posts from other people I always think to myself ""hm, I wonder how it went..."". So here's how it went.

We met on a non-gaming night to welcome back and plan the return of a player who was on baby break for a while. Once we all set down and before anyone even poured themselves a drink or opened a beer, the players just kept chatting and telling anecdotes and epic stories from the campaign to catch up the returning player. It really did well to remind me how excited everyone still is and how invested they are into all these crazy events and NPCs and character developements that happened so far. Unknowingly they really amped up my own excitement again as well. Maybe we should meet without playing and just shoot the shit and chat about the game, rpgs in general and irl stuff more often.

Originally I planned to end the campaign after a few sessions to get it to a satisfying conclusion at the end of the current story arc / adventure. It was in that moment I decided that the campaign deserved another chance. But I am really just fed up with dnd 5e and need a break. Maybe after the break I'll be more excited again to continue even if the system likely won't ever be something I consider very good. 

So I spoke up, said I wanted to announce something and told them how I felt but focused on the positives and mentioned how awesome seeing everyone absolutely hyped for our campaign just then was. However I need a break from 5e and want to run like a half a year palette cleanser adventure in a different system and different setting for them after the current story arc concludes. 

And not only was everyone super understanding and agreed to do that. Once we talked about it people got really excited and suggested settings and systems and ideas. I took some notes on which genres, settings and types of games people want to play. All players are open to very different systems such as narrative, OSR or even more avant-garde stuff and many different genres from cyberpunk to low dark fantasy and even super heroes or wuxia games. So I will compile a very short list of games we'll pick from together once we hit the break point in the current game. After that I'll run at least one more story arc and then re-evaluate again. The players said that sounds great to have a change of pace after every or every other dnd adventure. 

TL;DR: I will give the campaign another chance even though 5e doesn't excite me anymore. But everyone was more accepting and even excited to try new things. Having the most amazing people play at my table admittedly helps. Maybe my experience encourages some people in a similar situation to speak up to their group.",rpg,1712861253.0,0,3006,520

393,689,agd1hg,I had my worst experience ever,"Consider this a cautionary tale for all the new DMs here.

*Mandatory apology for grammar mistakes since English isn't my main language*

&#x200B;

Last weekend I went to the weirdest birthday party ever: there was a piñata, an amateur pole-dancing contest and D&D 3.5 campaign. Guess which one I chose? ^(on insight, I should've opted for the pole-dancing)

The DM was the friend of a friend and he had a premade 3.5 campaign to teach new players the ropes of RPG. Since he knew I play D&D, he asked me to join it to guide the rest of the party and I was more than happy to comply. 

I don't want to turn this post into a cringefest, so I'll sum up some of the highlights:

* The DM ridiculed the new players' decisions and asked me if that's what I would do if I were them.
* The Elf was scammed out of her infravision and even lost HP for stumbling on things in the dark. (she was a new player and didn't know she even had infravision to being with, when I pointed that out, the DM just said that he never told us we had special skills, so we didn't have them)
* We weren't allowed to delay our actions
* We were forced to use a full round actions to load light crossbows
* The new players were monkey pawed on every single action they made (Player A wanted to gather wood for a fire, DM told him that after an hour, he gathered a big pile of wet wood, even though there wasn't a dice roll to determine the success)
* NPCs were used to humiliate the new players, they mocked all the PCs choices that didn't go along with the DM's plans.
* If a player didn't describe what they wanted to do in a way that fully pleased the DM, they were forced to roll a d12 instead of a d20 for skill checks. (I don't know if the difficulty also changed accordingly, but I don't think so)
* The scenario changed to better suit the DM's desire to torture us (we got stranded in the sea in the middle of the night, the Druid wanted to use the stars as guidance, it was suddenly sunrise and we couldn't see stars in the sky. Better for us, we can use the sun, right? Nope, now a dense fog covers the ocean, we can't tell where the sun is.)
* The DM literally smirked and said ""now it's my turn to get some fun"" when we stumbled upon a freaking Necromancer and 6 skeleton soldiers in the middle of a ritual. (we were LV1 and hadn't had our full rest yet)

That's when I decided it was getting late (it really wasn't) and I called an Uber and went home.

I don't know how the game ended, but I know that it was a very frustrating experience for those new players and I wouldn't be surprised if they never play TTRPGs ever again.

So if you're an inexperienced DM, please, PLEASE, remember that we're supposed to have **fun** together. Even in CoC, players *have fun* while dealing with cosmic horrors and facing insanity. If you want to make people suffer, go play The Sims or write a horror novel.  End of rant.",rpg,1547584936.0,0,2893,558
394,696,vjnkwt,Playing D&D In Ukraine: Better And Worse At The Same Time,"Hi there, welcome to a day in my life. 

We're still in Ukraine, we're still alive, we're still into tabletop roleplaying games. How does it work out for us? Well, you see...

Living in a time of war gives you motivation. You want to, nay, you *need* to do something, because things are very wrong, and when things are very wrong, doing nothing might just drive you crazy. 

So, for the sake of preserving your sanity, you find something to do. You take a look at those old books you've long wanted to re-read, you think of things that you can borrow from the books to make your game more fun. You write up a character idea that you'd love to play out. 

You dive into your elf-game and you fight against monsters, you sneak past enemies,  you find treasures, you save kingdoms or you break kingdoms. You vent. Call it escapism if you like, but it's something that lets you put your emotions in check. 

And once you do that, you can think rationally and you can do something that's helpful for your people and your country. Which our group totally does. 

This is the *better* part. But there's also the *worse* part.

Normally, there's this nice little reserve of energy that helps you deal with minor problems. This guy likes the system that is objectively bad (it's incredible how often things that we don't like are objectively bad), this girl wants to play an undead ninja with a tragic backstory and complex psychological issues, *again*, and these two can't stop goofind around and do one serious reasonable thing if their characters' lives depended on it. You know, the kind of problems that people write about on reddit and other people always tell them to *bloody talk to their players like bloody adults* and it's usually the right thing to do. 

You talk about it, and introduce a couple homerules that make the system objectively better (seriously, everyone likes it), and the undead ninja's backstory now has some really interesting elements that are going to tie in nicely to the plot, and these two? Let them goof around, a game is no good without some laughter. 

That's what you do normally. 

You can't do it when things go wrong. That little reserve of energy is not there anymore, you've used it up just to keep living and not panic and not run around screaming. The minor problems suddenly become issues that hurt you, that you can't really deal with because it's too much. You don't have the strength to talk to people about those issues. It's easier to just shrug and move away and say ""you know, I'll probably skip the next session"". 

Maybe next week you'll feel better and you'll be able to talk to people and resolve the issues. 

Maybe by that time, things will get a little better and you'll feel a little less stressed. 

You really don't want to think that things might get a little worse, or a lot worse. 

But if they do, you know you'll just have to do something.

397,700,9exb9r,Unpopular Opinion and PSA: Stop telling people not to run certain games for new players,">It's 1981. You and your friends are bored twelve year olds. Steve, who's parents are really cool, bought him Dungeons and Dragons, and Steve spent a day or two reading over the rulebook. Steve has invited you and your friends over to his house to play the game. He explains the gist of it and you have a good time. Or you don't. The point is, a bunch of twelve year olds played Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. 

One of the common threads on this sub, a frequently asked question if you will, is ""New GM, what should I run?"" or some variation of ""Want to introduce my friends to x game, advice?"". Now, in the case of the first question, ""What should I run for the first time?"" everyone of course is going to recommend one of their own favorite games. 

Regarding the second question, ""I want to introduce my friends to a game that I already play. Do you have any advice?"".

Dozens upon dozens of different users on this sub have responded with some variation of ""Try a rules-lite RPG first, particularly this one that _I_ really like. Your game is too complicated for new players.""

I mean this is the nicest way possible: that's condescending. It's frankly insulting. Children used to figure out how AD&D, _AD&D_, worked for the most part. If we didn't do things based on perceived complexity, no one in the world would have started playing D&D to begin with, because there were easier games to play at the time. If you play Shadowrun weekly with friends, you don't need to stop playing Shadowrun in the name of the new guy/gal, because _everyone was new to the game at some point_. 

Anytime someone mentions ""new players"" next to the words ""Pathfinder"", ""Shadowrun"", or ""GURPS"", there's inevitably going to be somebody claiming that new players simply cannot possibly understand what's going on. 

I'm not claiming that someone can gain rules mastery within an  hour or a session or even a few sessions, I'm saying that anybody can learn any game, we were all new at some point, and frankly introducing people who haven't played any kind of RPG before to storygames is just as weird as crunchy games. 

Plenty of us got our starts in these systems, just as plenty of you got your start in whatever game your friends happened to be playing at the time. 

And I'm sorry that this came across as a bit of a rant, but I'm real tired of seeing this here and in other gaming forums. I think the only ""advice"" that makes me more offended than this is the implication that if you play D&D or another tradgame, you'll eventually move on because ""you just don't know that D&D isn't actually that fun.""

End rant. If you could just consider the way you word things a little more carefully, that would be great guys. Just remember that we all share a hobby, which is why we're all here. Sure, some of us like moving minis around on a map to kill things and some of us prefer pretending to be highschool werewolves dealing with their sexual identities, the point is, an RPG is an RPG. Don't shoot down someone else's good time, just be happy that your hobby is expanding. Thank you for your time.

**Edit**: As has been pointed out below, there is no black and white way of looking at this. My ""advice"" looks good on paper, but of course there are going to be some people who just don't jive with your game. Maybe there's one thing tripping them up, maybe they honestly don't get the system, maybe they're uncomfortable roleplaying, and a thousand other maybes.

I want to clarify here that I was not trying to attack rules-lite systems either, I enjoy quite a few of them myself. And I will concede that there is probably a difference between running a one shot just for some curious people, and for someone who you are trying to convince to join your gaming group.

As usual, folks are up in arms and this time it's in some part my fault. The point I was trying to make was that you should run what feels fun and good for you. Sometimes that won't work out, and that's fine. I'm sure a lot of us have seen outlier cases on both sides of the fence. 

After saying all that, I'd say the point I was *trying* to get across was:

To recap: I ordered the WotC 45th anniversary dice set back in September, got a damaged set in October and returned them and have had the runaround trying to get a replacement set or any information on when they might come since. After my post on r/dndnext  blew up, I got a message from Mike Mearls offering to look into the issue and to try to get a replacement set for me.

Unfortunately, after a week+ has now passed with no further word from Mike or WotC support (I did ping him on 12/2 to what he'd heard, but only got a short ""nothing yet - hope to hear something soon"" in reply), I've thrown in the towel. After an email asking for a refund rather than a replacement went unanswered, I contacted my credit card company for a dispute/chargeback. Hopefully I'll at least have a provisional credit back to me before Christmas so I can spend my money elsewhere.

To be honest, the whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth regarding WotC. For the amount being charged for these (insane, I know -this was a purchase only on my part due to both a windfall for my wife and I, and this having been a pretty big milestone career anniversary they were purchased for), I would have expected them to come unblemished, and for returns to be more customer friendly (I know there are extenuating circumstances with Covid, but this has dragged on far too long, and the lack of replies to my later emails has been frustrating to say the least). I super appreciate Mike reaching out and making an attempt to make things right, but if even he can't get so much as a reply from the returns people after a week, I'm afraid I have little faith in WotC or it's ability to get this fixed or provide a set worth what was paid for them (ie, undamaged).

408,717,go0t2q,Worst DM Habit That Turns You Off as a Player?,"It's not easy being a DM, but some behaviors are more tolerable than others. So I thought I'd ask folks around here, what is something that you've learned to take as a big red flag, and to duck out before frustrations mount?

One of the things I've found is that a DM who wants to make big, sweeping changes to a game's established setting or rulebook often does so to curtail player freedoms, but without just straight up asking players to narrow their character concepts to fit a certain theme. Someone who doesn't want a bunch of casters nerfs magic, someone who wants exclusively casters hamstrings rogues and fighters, etc.

A perfect example for me was a guy who was running a Werewolf: The Apocalypse game I got invited to. Talked a big game about how player freedom and choice mattered, but every time I'd try to do something (run a ritual that he'd approved on my theurge's sheet, try to use a gun in combat since it's a modern game, etc.), I got my wrist slapped. Because he was not running the game the way it was written in the book, and since I couldn't read his mind I had no way of knowing what changes he'd made to the setting. Eventually I just threw up my hands and left, because I'd located enough of the invisible walls he'd put in place to see that he wasn't going to allow anything other than his preferred way of running werewolves, and that was not a game I was willing to play.",rpg,1590080977.0,0,1402,261

413,728,7x8wgg,"My personal tips and house rules for people wanting to GM ""Everybody is John""","[**Rules**](https://imgur.com/ueKNhc3)

Everybody is John is a fantastically fun and hilarious game to GM for almost everybody, from the hardcore Shadowrun player to someone who scoffs at the mention of ""Dungeons and Dragons"" because it's too nerdy. It is legitmately one of my favorite party games because of it. However, it can be pretty hard to GM, largely because so much can be going on with so many people, and that there is only one character. To help people run it, here are my tips:

**The two big ones:**


Everybody is John is supposed to be fun, funny, very freeflow, and extremely chaotic. Run it as such. Don't go too hard on the rules if something is going to be fun/funny, and try not to let people be rules lawyers, as that can make the game less fun for everyone else.

Be detailed. I, and my players, find that details make the game more vibrant and fun. John doesn't break into a ""car"", he breaks into a ""red 1986 Honda Civic with a blue door"". He doesn't find a ""handgun"", he finds a ""Beretta 92 with 12 bullets left in the magazine"". John didn't find ""some drugs"", he found ""7/16 of a pound of cocaine"". Give players indepth information and they'll get more involved.

**Smaller tips:**

Don't give them too much equipment to start out with. Make them play for things like guns, drugs, and cars. My limits for starting equipment is usually 200 in cash and clothing. I also never start them out with any sort of ID, as personal choice.

Keep inventory and afflictions lists. These are usually pretty fun to read at the end, and lets you as GM know exactly how beat up is John.

Related to afflictions, treat John as if he can't feel pain and nothing short of death or losing limbs will stop him doing John things.

I usually avoid having John start in ""situations"" for me he often wakes up in the back of a busted car, in a shitty bed, or on a bench somewhere.

Give John illegal but not overpowered items, forcing your players to come up with ways of getting out of difficult places, such as getting pulled over by the cops.

Use a John voice. For convincing people, I have my player say what they want John to say, then repeat it to them in my John voice. Mine's like an drunk 3 pack a day Joker, but do whatever you want.

Use a d6 for loot generation if they're looking for stuff. A 6 is a lot of useful things, guns, drugs, car keys, etc. 2 is nothing, 1 is usually a rodent that bites them, with variations in between.

Make NPC names dumb. EX: ""You have stole the large Hispanic man's wallet. There is 3.50 in change, and a driver's license with the name Jeph Zooplegoit.""

**My House rules**

I have minimum willpower bids of 1. You cannot bid less than 1, it is not allowed.

Stimulant drugs add 1 to all rolls for 4 turns, and alcohol adds 1 to people skills and takes away 1 for fine motor control. John looses this bonus after 12 hours or sleeping. If players are consecutively doing drugs, GM roll a dice for risk of overdose.

Only way to lose control of John is failing an important roll, my John doesn't get hurt, feel pain or get bored during periods of nothing.

Since players will lose control less often, after 2 or 3 hours of playing time, players no longer get willpower back after John sleeps, this is to avoid having games drag on for too long.

During long periods of travel, like walking somewhere or driving, instead of John getting bored and losing control I roll 3d6 for random encounters to keep him not bored.

416,734,afj2ja,What Pokemon Taught Me About Worldbuilding,"In appreciation of a huge part of my childhood, I'm going to talk about the tips and tricks you can use from Pokemon. 

1. Episodic Adventuring
--

* Set yourself up for an easier time prepping by using an episodic structure. This will allow you to have generalized ideas of your world as a whole while only focusing on one location per session. 

* It stops you from having the ""open world"" vs. ""linear story"" discussion because there isn't one with an episodic story. 
* Each episode is linked, but how they are linked can be handwaved as traveling. 
* The direction of travel isn't as important because you are essentially resetting the party's footing with each session. 

* It creates a definite end and beginning to each session. Each session begins with the party coming to a place, or experiencing something new. Each episode ends with them moving on. 

2. Build the map as you go
--

* You have your starting town and your first adventure, plus you have your list of ideas that sound cool. 
* At the end of each session you can lay out some rumors for the party to choose from. 
* When they pick one, just place that as the next spot on your ""map"". No fuss, no hassle. 
* After 9 or 10 sessions you'll have a whole region mapped out. 

3a Theme
--

* In the World of Pokemon, there is a core theme. Capture pokemon, battle them to become stronger, become the ""very best"". 
* This is a goal and an attainable one. 
* What is the core theme of your world? Boiling your world down to an idea this basic can free you up to explore ideas that are not complete in your head. 
* You don't need to know why the nations are at war if your theme boils down to: go to town, capture base, win the war. 
* Everything else can come from that and you can give your party this information as a pitch. If they're in, they're in. If not, try the next idea.

3b Location Theme
--
* Instead of focusing on the minutiae of worldbuilding, when it comes to new locations in Pokemon, each one is based around its *own* theme. 
* In Pokemon, each gym has its specialty, and from that specialty, the town grows. The rock town is rough and stoic. The ghost town is spooky and horrifying. 
* Use those random ideas you have to be the fuel to flesh out the locations of your world. 
* If we continue with the war example, you might have a list that includes: the horrors of war, the downward spiral, losing a friend, letters from home. 
* Each of those will be a location in your world: a fresh battlefield where shellshocked soldiers call for the party's help, a wasteland where the weirdness of war pull at the party's sanity, a makeshift gravesite where the party faces their fallen comrades, a base with working water/comforts and a mailbox.

4a Enemies
--

* The World Theme creates the enemies. 
* In Pokemon, it's other trainers. 
* In this War World (which I'm starting to grow fond of) it's the opposing army. 
* You don't need to know everything about them, just that they are on the opposite side of your Party. 
* They fight against the party because of the Theme. 
* They oppose the party to fulfill the theme.

4b Recurring
---
* Recurring enemies creates fondness, understanding, and something *other*. 
* Just like a player can learn about their character by experiencing various situations and reacting to them, so can we learn about the enemy by experiencing them every session. 
* And not a group of faceless nobodies. But people with faces and names. 
* In Pokemon, it's Jesse and James. 
* In this War World, it might be the seductress who is a double agent, or an opposing sniper who radios in to taunt the party. 
* It's through repeated exposure that relationships and life are brewed. 

5. Random Encounters
--

* In Pokemon, between each of gym battles, the gang has an encounter. Usually out in the woods, or on the road. 
* These are just random encounters, and random encounters done right. Each one is impactful and lends itself to the overall theme. 
* Each one involves the gaining of a pokemon, the battling of some strange trainer, the accomplishment of some bonding exercise, or the thwarting of the enemy trying to steal your power. 
* In the War World, the random encounters could be POWs, a ruined village with survivors, mortar attacks, ambushes, a strange adventure where you have to dress fancy and mingle at some benefit. 
* Create a list of 10 ideas and use that as your springboard for random encounters. 

6. Re-imagining the old
--

* Pokemon is just a homebrew DnD world where the spells are living and wizards capture them to battle and grow stronger. 
* You can create a fresh spin for *your* world just be fluffing something old (spells) as something new (pokemon). 
* What if all monsters were just people, the name in the monster manual was their nickname? 
* What if all the races were actually animals (humans are dogs, elves are cats)? 
* What if dragons are just ideas that you can be infected with?

418,738,1aixz6,Recently uncovered a Chekhov's gun four years in the making. Anyone's GM ever keep a HUGE secret for  LOOOONG time?,"My GM, possibly the best GM in the history of GMs, runs a game of Legend of the Five Rings. Setting: Sorta-Samurai in Sorta-Japan.

This is long but hopefully worth your time.

Thanks partly to a PC math error, our little world got invaded by the Moon. Long story, but the Moon is a deity in this universe. His forces begin with a few cultists, but eventually recruit a bunch of ronin, and soon we have actual defectors from the great samurai clans fighting for the enemy.

Factions form, split, reform. Long-dead threats rise to take their piece of the pie. Enormous battles ensue.

My party's job is to gather a group of what amounts to demigods in order to put an end to all this madness. It is a crappy job. High turnover rate. Thankfully, our benevolent GM came up with a new healing potion sold at a recently opened chain store we could find in almost any town. Due to his love of Engrish, he named the potion ""White Pearl Super Big Power.""

It's kind of expensive, but heals better than almost anything else on the market, and replenishes all your spent Void points (points you burn for an extra 1k1 on anything, among other benefits).

We started stocking up on this early on, using it very quickly, then running back to the store to get more. We use it to replace sleep, since sleep only heals you 1/3 as much.

The stuff works instantly, so a common maneuver in combat is to spend a round getting to a downed (useful) comrade and dumping a bottle of it down his throat, then leaving him with a few more so he can finish healing and get back up and fight. A round lasts about five seconds in-game, so this amounts to getting knocked unconscious for ten seconds, spending fifteen seconds or so shaking it off, then getting up and fighting at near-full capacity.

Crowning achievement: in combat, one PC figured out how to break physics with his bandoleer of these bottles:

1. Drink a White Pearl to heal some HP and get all his Void back.

2. Spend a Void to gain another action for the round.

3. Repeat until fully healed.

*And our GM allowed it.* (He did have this guy mind-raped by a miniboss immediately afterward as a not-so-subtle hint that maybe this sort of thing would draw the attention of our opponents. We occasionally do it anyway.)

I cannot even imagine how many gallons of this stuff we've ingested as we've trod through this worsening war, watching whole cities fall to the Moon, our centuries-old way of life obliterated, but knowing we need to live to fight another day, even if victory will be hollow by the time we achieve it.

Eventually we bought so much of this stuff that our GM had his little chain store start selling subscription bottles. We bought those, used them up in a day, and came back for refills.

Over the course of *four real-life years*, getting together anywhere from weekly to monthly, we marched through this campaign. Not one original party member remains, but we always swear in the new guys to continue fighting the good fight. And always, always, we stay stocked with White Pearl Super Big Power.

A week ago, my character, having suffered several concussions, and being out of his White Pearl, held the empty glass bottle up to the sky one evening to see if there was a single drop left in it. There was.

It was exactly the same color as the moon.

420,741,hedx78,Using Disorders in RPGs,"Please, please educate yourselves before using any disorder with your character in a game. As someone with a very stereotyped and stigma carrying disorder (OSDD-1b which is on the spectrum of Dissociative Identity Disorder), seeing posts and stories of characters with mental illness done wrong can cause a lot of pain especially when others pick up on how that player and DM incorporated that disorder as how it is in real life. Many of these disorders can be and are handled wrong. Please don’t base these things off the media, such as basing Dissociative Identity Disorder off of Split, and think that’s how it is. Giving a character a disorder can be interesting and add a lot to the game especially with things like PTSD/C-PTSD, but if you go with the stereotypes and misinformation it can lose that complex and interesting value and also do a lot of damage you might not realize even if it’s just something in your group.

PTSD isn’t just what they show in the media, there are several types of flashbacks that aren’t just full flashbacks. You can have emotional flashbacks and physical flashbacks. You can have no flashbacks at all and just have nightmares. Look at Caleb on Critical Role, he has PTSD and I think it’s done wonderfully. He doesn’t have violent fits when having a flashback like they show in the media, but he is good representation of PTSD, in my opinion, done well in dnd. 

Dissociative Identity Disorder, formerly Multiple Personality Disorder, and OSDD, Otherwise Specified Dissociative Disorder, are complex disorders that are often covert to the point the host, the primary alter (not personality the term is alter) who takes care of daily life, might not find out they are part of a system until they are in their sixties. There is a lot more to these disorders than just alters. DID forms when a child undergoes extreme and severe repeated trauma that is often repeated abuse. These people are not dangerous or violent like the media portrays. They are often scared children trapped in memories of trauma, people living a life that isn’t their own, animals inside humans bodies, and so much more that the brain of this individual grabbed from around them to cope with what they were going through. People with DID are not like the people who hurt them, they are not dangerous or violent.

There are so many more disorders I have seen and heard of being portrayed badly in dnd games and I only touched on the two I know the most of that are very much colored by the media. Now, this is not me saying don’t use mental disorders for your characters, I think that using them with characters can be a great learning tool for educating yourself on mental illness, but please don’t use mental illness with characters in your dnd games unless you educate yourselves. People share stories of their games which influences other people and their characters or games. So as someone with a very stereotyped disorder that holds a lot of stigma due to misinformation from the media, please please educate yourselves before adding a mental illness to your characters.",rpg,1592916182.0,0,3083,532

I honestly didn't know where to post this, but I needed to get it off my chest.  
  
A few years ago during covid, my marriage and my life fell apart. It had always been rocky, but one day out of the blue I come home to find that my house had been completely trashed, my kids had moved out with their mom, and I was left alone. To make matters worse, I had lost my job and had a hard time finding another one due to the epidemic. I was actually, at 43 years old, making sandwiches at Publix. So here I am, no money, no kids, in a trashed house with even my pets gone. And I have some chronic health problems that due to not having insurance, were going untreated. I was falling apart mentally and physically.  
  
I honestly considered suicide, but I could never do it because of my kids.  
  
My son was into 40K and he said that he wanted to start playing on the weekend. I managed to get an eBay credit card and lucked out finding a fully painted space marine force for 300 bucks. Every Saturday we would go to lunch and then to the game store to play. His new stepdad was pretty well off, so he was always playing different armies, but I played my space marines.  
  
I was so poor that sometimes the rest of the week me and my new cat would share eggs for dinner. He never said anything, but he started paying for his own lunch. Then he would buy kits here and there for my favorite army, Orks. He would build them. He said it was so he could have someone to paint with.  
  
Eventually I found a decent job and got mentally well enough to start putting my home together again (I won the home in the divorce, which is another story. I deserved it). I started my old D&D game back up. People would come and go, but he was there every other week. Never missed a game unless he was out of town.  
  
Cut to now, I have a very good paying job, a wonderful girl that I plan to marry, and am happy, if a bit scarred. He still comes over to play and paint, and he makes sure I go to the gym with him four days a week as well.  
  
We don't talk about feelings. We don't hug. I don't know how much of this was a plan to help me or just spend time with me, and how much of it was him wanting to play games. If I tried to thank him, I know he would freeze up and wouldn't be able to talk.  
  
I want to thank him for saving my life but I don't know how. I have literally opened my mouth to say something a dozen times and couldn't get the words out.

422,743,mqmmdx,"Honey, some dudes with guns are at the door. They want you to run D&D and only D&D for the rest of your life (apparently)","There's a type of post that crops up quite a bit in this and other TTRPG subs and it goes a little something like this:

""I have been running a D&D campaign for a while now. I started out as a player but when the DM had to drop out  I stepped up on an interim basis and now it's five years later. 

Don't get me wrong, I like D&D just fine, it's just that I would love to run something different. However, every time I bring up the possibility of running Call of Cthulhu or World of Darkness my players start moaning, rocking back and forth, foaming at the mouth, and rending their own flesh with fingers so gnarled and blackened by anger that they have come to resemble talons. 

Is there any way I can get them to maybe consider trying something different? I'm just tired... So very very tired.""

How common is this problem? Is it relatively new?

I ask as my experience has always been that running the game means that you have a good deal of leeway when it comes to deciding upon which games get run. 

Now, obviously there's always going to be a bit of back-and-forth and having your group enjoy a particular game means that you're naturally going to be more enthusiastic about running that game but I get the impression from this sub and others that people will just dig their heels in and point blank refuse to even try other games.

The reference to dudes with guns showing up at the GM's house is a reference to the faint undertone of menace that always pervades these posts. GMs desperately trying to keep on the good side of the guy with the gun. 

Is this real? Have people experienced having their group implode or just not turn up rather than trying something new?

Has the social contract between GM and player changed or are people just more fearful of losing whatever group they have (particularly under lockdown)?",rpg,1618390644.0,0,1831,336

430,752,cofwz8,Flashback is an RPG where you develop your character by adding to their backstory and building personality traits,"[Flashback](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flashbackrpg/flashback-rpg-a-roleplaying-game-about-changing-history) is an indie RPG project that began as a way to help new players build more interesting backstories for their characters.

We wanted to give first-time players a reason to go beyond identifying themselves simply by their race, class and weapon of choice (or worse, a table full of dark mysterious strangers with amnesia). In Flashback, players must justify their skills by explaining how they acquired their abilities in the past: as they are about to perform a task, they have the opportunity to tell a story about their history to the rest of the table. This means that every situation is packed with roleplaying and character growth - even in the middle of combat you are encouraged to develop your character.

What’s more, you get to reveal your character’s backstory gradually and give others a chance to contribute ideas. Players build on each other’s concepts and the GM gets an endless source of material to connect players to the world and ongoing narrative. From there, Flashback grew around the central idea of providing real incentives for roleplaying instead of just an afterthought. The next innovation came with the idea of defining your character through personality traits instead of physical attributes.

The Personality Trait system is based on the same traits that psychologists use to model the human psyche. It’s mind over matter - your physical and mental attributes are actually influenced by aspects of your personality. You might be physically strong because your *Disciplined* nature helps you to focus and train hard. You might be vigilant and perceptive because your *Skeptical* outlook makes you question every tiny detail.

By putting the focus on your character’s internal nature instead of their external stats, players always have roleplaying at the forefront of their thoughts. What’s more, your power and advancement are directly tied to the expression of your character’s personality. It’s good to be a little Stubborn sometimes - nobody respects a pushover - but if you try to min-max your personality then the other characters will probably start to find you difficult and abrasive.

We've received some very positive [reviews](https://www.indieuncovered.com/tabletop/flashback-rpg-preview/) and [feedback](https://thecampaignermagazine.com/2019/07/flashback-preview/), and we really hope Flashback will encourage players to discover the joy of roleplaying in RPGs. You really just need to unlearn the idea of being a passive player and embrace the ""everyone is a storyteller"" idea.

432,761,5oyyoj,How to Run RPGs for Busy Adults,"Hey gamers, I turn 40 this year and, if there's one thing I've learned about trying to keep a gaming group together recently, it's that running RPGs for busy adults is challenging. Here are some tricks I've learned for how to make it all work:

**1)** Run it less like *Lord of the Rings* and more like a *Star Trek* television series. Instead of writing adventures where 4-6 specific characters go on an epic quest that spans a dozen game sessions, try to keep each adventure to one game session. You can have an ongoing story, but instead of ""take this ring back from whence it came"" it's more like ""these are the voyages.""

**2)** Let each player maintain multiple characters, but only play one at a time. That way, if you do have an adventure that requires multiple sessions, but some players can't make it to all the games, you can put those stories on hold and do one-shot sessions with different characters from each player's portfolio. This also gives you a chance to mix up different personalities for interesting results.

**3)** To facilitate point #2 above, keep all the characters in the same organization so their comings and goings are easier to manage. Whether it's Starfleet, the Pathfinder Society, the X-Men, or the Camarilla of Chicago, it helps tie the players together and keep the adventures episodic. Introductions are simple and it's easier to align each character's objectives from adventure to adventure.

**4)** Embrace the full power of modern technology! Start a Facebook page for the group to keep track of everything. Use a free online blog to keep track of previous adventures, the status of the group, and what's on the schedule. Since your time is so precious (and often short) for actual gaming, try to put as much paperwork, planning, and downtime activity as possible there or in email. If you get the group together for a game, don't waste a second of it leveling up, deciding who's going to GM, or what everyone wants on their pizza - do all that online before or after the game!

The result of using these points is advantageous on several levels. For starters, you can rotate GMs much easier, which helps prevent burn-out and is very healthy for a group. It's also great for adding or removing players from the group; join or leave whenever! Finally, it makes it much easier to switch game systems, take a night off for board games or movies, and even put the whole group on hiatus from time to time (like over the holidays).

Following these guidelines has *vastly* improved my ability to continue gaming, even now that I'm getting older. I hope they help you, too! If you've got any other ideas, I'd love to hear about them in the comments. Cheers!",rpg,1484856737.0,0,2692,471

But rats don't fight people. They are active at night and they are smart. They will hide and run as long as that is an option. That's why we've used cats and traps and ratcatcher dogs - because humans fighting rats in a straight combat does not make much sense.

Chickens on the other hand are active during the day. In a medieval settings they should be everywhere. Chickens are ferocious fighters - in some places they have been used for cockfighting before even being used for food. Roosters have long and sharp spurs - long enough to gouge arteries of an adult human with an unlucky strike. In fact, chickens are the smallest animals that have rarely, but consistently killed adult humans through force (and not with venom, poison, infection or an allergy).

442,775,a4z3c7,Ran DND for the first time and found all prejudices true,"Edit 2: I was advised that the correct word I should have used would be stereotypes not prejudices. Sorry, English is a second language.

I had a fascinating experience recently where I DM'd 5e for a group of colleagues, none of us with experience in the system, but some general experience in TTRPGs. We played around 4 hours through a short 2-room dungeon, with a fairly classic setup (save the blacksmith's daughter from goblin sacrifice). I had a bunch of sample characters laid out, from which the players picked. The exploration and combat encounters were fun, fluid, and sufficiently challenging (they barely escaped death). 

But all of the prejudices and complaints I had heard of about DND were so clearly showcased it was almost fascinating. First we had a no call no show. Then I had to discuss rules (which spells need a spell attack roll), our rogue stole loot gold and almost brought about PvP when the other players challenged him on it. I have no idea how I will resolve this next session btw. And to cap it off, the time we spent packing up was filled with debate on alignment despite me repeatedly saying to not worry to much about that and focus on looking at their characters motivations, instincts and flaws. 

I could hardly believe it that the memes I've heard about DND just stared me blank in the face like that. I'm utterly curious how the next sessions will go. I will probably put something less dungeon-crawly before them, and I'll see how it goes.

Edit: Y'all dropped about 10 times as many comments as I expected and I have a hard time keeping up on my phone. Let me address some common comments:

1. I don't think that my problems are DND- problems. I just wanted to express my surprise at running into exactly the things that people on the internet complained about with their DND games. 

2. We actually had a pretty good time and in terms of first games I've had far worse. I think 5e is a fun game and I enjoy its combat far more than some of the other games I've played. 

3. Of course no call no show is not a DND problem. It's just one of the almost memetic issues I've read about in connection with DND. This is obviously not a system problem...

443,776,24sd7z,My daughter's favorite game mechanic in our home-brewed RPG,"My 9 year old daughter and I have been playing a custom game since she was 3 called Princesses & Palaces. She loves most everything about the game but the simple mechanic I'm proudest of is one of the last ones we devised. 

Her princesses are d20 characters. That means they have 20 hp and every one of her rolls are d20. But many of the princesses' pets and most of the mobs are d4 on up. A goblin is d6. It has 6 hp and its puny rolls lead to a lot of quick deaths. All of the dice get used, which is ultimately the coolest part for a young kid, and she gets exposed to different percentages and variations of math and statistics as she fights d10 and d12 monsters. 

I remember playing D&D as a 12 year old back in 1981. We LOVED it like nothing else but even at 12 we didn't have patience for all the rules. What was important was rolling the fancy dice and killing the monsters. I feel like we've captured that simple kid excitement with this game and really gotten her hooked on the variety of dice with this mechanic. She's almost always the overwhelming favorite to win the rolls and her precious princesses are rarely in danger. But every once in a while her d20 under rolls my d4 or d8. 

Pretty sure I've got a gamer for life here. If anyone is interested in the Princesses & Palaces rule book for their own kids, let me know.

You might remember that about three years ago I made a series of posts of a LotFP hack about playing a halfling in a peaceful, pastoral, quiet land called the Commonwealth. During quarantine this year, I blew the dust off of this project and created tons of new content for it. 

It's no longer a hack but a standalone game. Its parts and procedures should be familiar to fans of old-school TTRPGs. It's explicitly a game about the quiet pastoral life of halflings so a lot of fat from dragons and/or dungeons has been trimmed off. There are tons of flavorful randomizers to make sure your halfling's life is quiet, but never boring. Additionally, [Evlyn Moreau](https://www.patreon.com/evlynmoreau) and [Isaac Podyma](http://instagram.com/orangepipart/) very generously donated the use of their art to the project.

I've been DMing D&D for ~10 years and i learned the game through that side of the DM screen.  I see encounters as carefully balanced equations, I see battlemaps as constructed choice generators, I different abilities as cool fun factors (or fun ruiners).  I see the game as a complicated tool to make the players have as much fun as possible and I think I'm good at it.  

BUT

Now I'm trying to be a player and everything pisses me off.  High AC, High health, low damage enemies drag on combat in a boring slug fest, PC get mind controlled with out even repeated saves, and battlefields are just empty wastelands. And I get SO MAD.  I've gotten better at not ruining things for the rest of the party now that I know I'm a problem, but that still kills the enjoyment for me.  The rest of the party seems fine with everything and that's all that really matters so it's not like the DM is make ""mistakes"", it's just that they run it differently from me.  I'm the problem, not the DM.

My father just passed away after a 9 month long battle with glioblastoma. It's been pretty devastating to say the least, and I've skipped the past couple weeks running the LGS's Westmarches Campaign. So I mean it hasn't taken much, I'm a wreck. I think the pizza the other night made me sad. Ugh that's a different story. Anyways...


My aunt was sending emails around to all the relaticks asking who knew the names 'Netty, Ma'hal, Medrash, and Varis.' and I was answered her that I knew those names together.  I had forgotten that my regular players had sent a very nice bouquet to the wake and it made me break down...again... It was very nice and sweet of them to think of me. Now I must kill them for making me feel 'emotions'.



Interesting story-time;  that aunt was the one who together with her husband had gifted me ""Dragons of Autumn Twilight"" and ""The Hobbit"" When I was 12 or so at Christmas.  I absolutely devoured them and bought the entire Dragonlance series then continued on throughout the planes.  They're probably the reason I am a huge dork and still (forever)DM.  So I described each character and their titles/ affiliations in game with a bit of back story on them.  The aunt and uncle thought it was great and apparently my uncle used to play back in the 70's DM'd by his brother.  I was at their house picking up a thank you card and he (A professor with multiple degrees and phd's) said 'I'll be right back I have some of my Bro's books upstairs' and he jumped up bolted off and got the books attached in the picture below. Some of them have statistical equations scribbled in the margins haha.
[books!](https://i.imgur.com/o8eD5PB.jpg)


We talked some D&D and how it's culturally relevant again and exploding due to streaming and main stream media, he had thought it had just died off and gone away. suddenly he had a flash of remembrance about ""some dungeon I loved, that was green and had a lich in it!"" and ran off.   I was thinking... 'do you really have one of those? An original...?'


Sure enough he bounded back down their spiral marble staircase (they basically live in a mansion) carrying the below module:

456,802,jfm4i1,A Quick Tip for Game Masters,"By giving your villains seemingly innocuous traits you can set up future showdowns with foreshadowing. Here is an example of encountering the villain for the first time:

""You wade through the trash-filled alley to get a better look at who killed your friend. A tall man dressed in a fancy suit and baring a jagged scar on his chin is leaning up against the far wall smoking. The area is thick with cigarette smoke and many butts lay on the ground, you get the feeling he's been here before and this was not his first time.""

So the bad guy smokes. That doesn't seem relevant, merely just a basic trait. But next time you have the villain appear, emphasize his smoking habit again, keeping it subtle. Finally, when the real showdown is about to take place, have the party arrive on the scene, lets say they're there for another reason, and give them a strong clue that will trigger their memories.

""You arrive at the flower shop and to your surprise, the place is empty and dead silent. A thick stench of cigarettes wafts in the air. The backroom door is closed.""

Your players will hopefully pick up on your clues and your long-term planning will pay off in a subtle way, as your players will think they're brilliant for figuring out that the villain was in the area and it will set the tone of the scene in an intense way.

Bad guys have bad plans. Your evil character is likely smart, conniving, and wants to beat your players and achieve their own goals (hopefully). This post and video was inspired by another popular writeup on the topic.

I've created a video that helps DMs better flesh out their BBEGs (Big Bad Evil Guys) by using the Army's OPORD (operational order) structure to help develop how your evil character goes about their evil plans!

**Step 1: Define the situation:**

1. Create Map where action takes Place
2. Describe situation in one sentence  
ex: The Ogre King Norag has created an alliance of foul creatures and began his march to conquer the lands of the Free People !
3. Pose dramatic question of the conflict  
Will the heroes be able to forge an alliance between the Free People and defend against King Norag’s army?

**Step 2: Define the Mission (Goals vary -- define long term mission vs short term mission)**  
Example Shor term mission -- Capture a coastal town of Poyraz.  
Who?  
Goblin Special Forces  
What?  
Amphibious assault on Poyraz  
When?  
Period of Darkness, May 10th  
Where?  
Northern shore  
Why?  
Circumvent blocking force, cut off human supply lines & gain control of bridge

**Step 3: Execution**  
How will your BBEG achieve victory? What are the decisive steps along the way needed for mission success?  
There are many non-violent ways to achieve mission success. Perhaps a wants to take over a major swath of land. They might bribe local officials to lower their defenses, or use spies to assassinate key figures!

**Step 4: Logistics**

**Beans**  
Living creatures need food, vampires need blood, dragons ""need"" treasure  
What does your BBEG need?

1. Fuel will affect their decisions
2. Roads & transportation matter

**Bullets**  
Archers need arrows, Mages need spell supplies (bat Guano, anyone? Big upvote if you remember which popular spell requires bat poop)

Bandit recruits need swords!

1. Production will be attacked

What about POWs?

**Step 5 Command and Control (I spent a lot of time making the Organization chart for this part of the ppt and I highly recommend using them to figure out how your bad guy communicates to their underlings!)**

**Leadership**  
Who’s actually in charge?

Centralized or Decentralized?

Who are the successors?

**Signals**

How does the BBEG get out his message & orders?

Who actually receives the message?

Is there intentional misinformation?

I hope these questions and examples help you all develop better evil characters in your campaign. I hope you enjoyed the video and found useful ideas in it!

The players raised an army, faced opposition from within and without. The party uncovered ancient mysteries and reforged forgotten alliances.  The characters went from outlaws and laughing-stocks to become generals and grandmasters of the sorcerous schools.

Then last night we had our final session.  The player's armies were crushed, the sorcerers fell and the back up plans were thwarted. Two of the player character's died, both sacrifices to prevent the apocalypse but the battle was lost and without further intervention the handful of liches and elves were able to fulfill their plans anyway: they revoked the magic of the gods to made a world without births, a world where evil doers cannot be condemned to suffer in hell and the righteous are denied paradise in heaven.

One player character survived to witness the slow death of the world with no hope of ever being able to raise such an army again.

But, it feels like everyone gets in a sort of comfort zone and will shy away from the prospect of anything that's not d20 rules. Again, I'm generalizing, but this is due to my own personal experiences. I met one pair of players who said that they had recently played a 'Star Wars' game and getting excited, I asked them what system they used, to which they responded with they modded 5e and I was just flabbergasted. I mean D&D isn't designed to be a universal system. Hell, if it was I could then at least understand why people don't want to change.

&#x200B;

I've tried multiple times with different groups, to run other systems like: Hero System, GURPS, Call of Cthulu, Cortex, Unisystem, Polaris, Numenera, Fantasy Flight Star Wars, and this list just goes on. But the majority of time, the group barely gets through character creation (if we even get that far) before they start giving up. I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm not selling the other systems that well, but no one else seems to even be willing to look at the books to see if they can understand it. There are sooooo many systems and settings that I've been wanting to try.

&#x200B;

I simply don't understand the apprehension to try something new. People have their comfort zones sure, but there's just so much beyond the boundaries of D&D, yet so few seem willing to explore it.

&#x200B;

Does anyone else have this issue or am on an island by myself? If you can relate, how do you convince players to take a chance on a new system? Where you ever that apprehensive player? What changed your mind?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Great Cesar's ghost! This post blew up. I never expected this kind of response. Thank you all for your comments and insights (yes even you three or so people who joked about the Game of Thrones showrunners, I see you).  

&#x200B;

Now, a few things to address. 

1. It seems like there's a chunk of you that think that I get upset with other players because they like D&D. That's not true at all. I have no problem with people liking the system, I just would like to be able to find people who are willing to try, keyword ""TRY"", something new. D&D will always be there and if you enjoy the system, that's great! It's a fine system to enjoy.

&#x200B;

2. Every time I've tried to introduce a new system, I always willing take on the role of GM. It would be ludicrous to expect someone to pick up a new system, just so that I can be a player. I always want to slowly integrate people into the system and will be taking on the brunt of anything that may be difficult (i.e. the math). I tell my players this up front and that always seems to ease their concern somewhat. The Pre-gen idea feels like the best way to go.   


3. It's difficult for me to wrap my head around some of the reasons given (too time-consuming, too much work, don't want to read, etc.) seeing as how I find that kind of stuff fun. I'm a writer & filmmaker, so creating new worlds and characters have always appealed to me. And the reasoning that some gave about GM's not wanting to put in the work and would rather have something with a lot of extra material (modules and such) available is particularly baffling to me. To each their own though, I get that not everyone is going to have the same mindset I do. All of the replies have given me a better perspective on the whole thing and so hopefully I can work on fixing my sales pitch, if you will.

&#x200B;

4. This thread has also made me realize that I need to do something that I've thought was needed for a while. I feel like there should be a video series of different RPG settings and systems, that go over the character creation processes and rules of each and culminates in an actual play set up to show how everything works. I feel like if I had a group and I was trying to convince them to play a new system, that showing them a video explaining things would be better received than just handing them a PDF. Do you guys feel like this is something that could be beneficial?",rpg,1561752336.0,0,4598,860
473,829,wnbf3z,Opinion: Buying & selling gear is one of the weakest and blandest parts of traditional RPGs.,"Not trying to put down anyone who doesn't mind how buying & selling stuff works, I just wanna express my annoyances even though everyone's table experience and opinions are different.

I dunno if it just has to do with how my DMs and I have gone about doing it, but I find the process of buying gear and selling treasure to be a very unexciting part of traditional fantasy tabletop systems like D&D, Pathfinder, and others. For a part of the game that happens so frequently, I've found that every ""shopping encounter"" goes like this:

1. PCs arrive in a town with things to buy or sell.

2. Sometimes, the shop to sell a specific item isn't there, and it has to be done at another town, otherwise,

3. PCs go into a shop. Sometimes, there's a bit of roleplay as the DM describes the store and the quirky shopkeep, but usually this is just skipped as everyone wants to get it over with. Sometimes there will be a Charisma check to haggle for a specific item, but usually not.

4. Money is added or subtracted and said item is exchanged.

I get that this might be a necessary evil, but I'm only complaining about this because it *feels* like it could be done better, and it's such a significant part of the game that it needs some refinement. Coinage has to have some sort of meaning so the players can get excited about having it to purchase the goodies they want, but this whole process feels as dry as doing taxes to me.

Am I missing something? Are there better ways to do this, to spice up the way shopping or selling treasure works to make it more exciting? Have you tried any personal ways to spice things up, or know of any systems that use an alternative method of doing things, like a barter system? I want to make the exchange of goods more interesting.",rpg,1660386880.0,0,1762,327
474,830,ugxo9g,"Silly Idea: Multiverse Superhero team game, where everyone plays as a variation of the same character.","I've been reading too many alternate universe comics in which slightly-tweaked versions of characters bump into other versions of themselves, and I'm absolutely *here* for it. I've been wondering if it might be fun to try a similar setup in an RPG, just to see how the dynamic plays out at the table. What do you think of this idea?

The players are provided with a basic template for, say, Captain Fantastic. Fantastic has a race, class, stats, and basic background, e.g., ""Father was a supervillain, killed him in single combat and liberated the city he controlled."" Players take that template and must build a fresh character around it, the whacker the better, without consulting the other characters. Thus, the party consists of Good Sir Fantastic, a knight who deposed evil King Fantastic I, Captain Fantastic 2099, who protects a space station, bitter and jaded Old Man Fantastic, and so on. Importantly, each character is convinced they are the One True Fantastic, and do not know anything about the others.

The characters are drawn together into the ""prime"" universe when Prime  Fantastic goes missing, and are tasked with saving the city from a powerful villain that, in all likelihood, will turn out to be a gender-swapped Captain Fantastic.

McElroy's accuser initially claimed not to have kept his years of correspondence with her that detailed the abuse, but after he posted his initial denial she has seemingly rediscovered the texts/emails on an old phone which may have led to the retraction of McElroy's first blanket denial of her claims.

One person's etiquette was beyond terrible, would be on their phone most of the session, randomly shoot important NPC's, never ever bothered to learn the rules (I'd have to roll for them) etc. 

Another never told me if they were comming or not giving me no time whatsoever to prep. On top of that same problems as the other player. 

Another would say extremely stupid, racist, and/or homophobic shit for no reason. 

One was never able to make a backstory for their character.. . Ever. No personality, no RP, nothing. They were just a bystander the whole story, only participating in combat. 

The fifth person was mostly alright but was a chronic rules lawyer who just always had his two cents to give. I was the forever GM and he would sometimes offer to GM. His games always fell through and it'd be back on me, which was frustrating. 

Eventually I fell out with one of them and decided to bow out. I ended up looking for groups online. Thank God for online games. 

I've met a lot of people who are actually considerate and do basically none of the things I've mentioned here. If you feel like your legacy group of sorts is getting stale: it is, you're right, move on. 

These sorts of groups are often romanticized but I gotta say sometimes that Magic just doesn't stick. I still talk to all of these people save one, none of them play anymore. I'd be lying if I said I don't find that gratifying. 

Tldr: Your childhood friends might actually not be the best people to play TTRPGS with. Sometimes we don't realize that otherwise great people can be toxic players. Don't be afraid to find a group of hobbyists with similar values and expectations.

I gave them the character sheets and the book and left for 30 minutes. I wasn't really expecting anything to happen, I thought they would just shoot the shit for half an hour, which would have been fine. What ended up happening was they had a pitch for a game they wanted (which was nothing like what I had planned) and their characters concepts ready for me (also not what I was expecting). I was a little hesitant to try and work with a campaign seed not of my own creation, but after a couple minutes of asking questions and furiously improvising a solar system while they statted up characters, we were off to the races. This probably is going to seem obvious, but I have never seen players be more invested in a game. Y'all should try this session 0.5 method of ""say you're playing X setting then fucking off entirely out of the room for 30 minutes"" and tell me if this was a fluke or not. 

Props to the Mophidius Dune system, the editing/writing in the book is shit sometimes but the system itself is lightweight enough for you to straight up run a dune game with no prep, provided you have knowledge of the setting, while still having enough crunch to dial in on the really important stuff.

Anyhow, I thought 'why not' and met up with them to talk about this new game and what they were thinking of for the show.

484,842,9hix4m,My 13 yo daughter is starting a D&D group as part of a class assignment but they will only have :30 to play. What (and how) could she run such a session for a group of complete RPG newbies?,"  
She's a player in the Fallout Tabletop campaign (using custom rules) that I've been running since the beginning of the year, so she has at least some idea how RPG works. Everyone else however is completely new to it.

It's part of an assignment in a once-a-week class: Create a guild, invite other classmates. She did that and 5 people joined. First assignment is ""List what academic qualities your guild has."" Well shit that's the easy part. First, *MATH,* then a bunch of intangibles from logic to leadership.

The 2nd thing is she's already planning the character making session for next weeks class, so that's not going to suck away time from play.

The hard part is content. Experienced players could grab, or even throw together, canned chars and jump into an arena fight, king of the hill type, and play for 30 no problem. Being new is what makes it difficult.

I was thinking a couple of simplified things:

* Use 1 die. d20 only. 
* Baddies can only take certain number of hits, and each successful d20 roll takes off one hit. So a goblin would have 1 hit, but the boss vampire/dragon/demon would have say 6 hits... with a party of 5, it would take minimum 2 rounds to bring him down. This removes the tedium of damage dice, but also removes the math.
* Have a small set of chars that the players can choose from, and give them simplified stats. Then have a set of options for those chars to choose from. This would allow some customization while keeping things simple. For example, choose 3 from a list of 10 mage spells with different effects.

With a simple set of rules and options, the time-consuming parts of a DnD session are reduced to a minimum, allowing for speedier story telling, adventuring and murder hobo-ing.

One other thing: She said D&D, I'm not opposed to suggesting a 3rd party ruleset, but I think as a core concept it should stick to DnD-like high magic fantasy. 

What other ideas could I incorporate? What caveats should I keep in mind?  ",rpg,1537476990.0,0,1975,352

I ran *The Curse of Nineveh* campaign in Call of Cthulhu which lasted for more than twenty sanity-rending blood-soaked sessions. To commemorate it I commissioned artist [@ChrisCantArt](https://twitter.com/ChrisCantArt) to paint us a picture of the climax. And boy did he deliver!

The climax started when the British monarch George V was possessed by the baddie, and one of my PCs murdered him right at the center of the annual royal garden party. This was just as London was about to be attacked by an avatar of Yog-Sothoth. It decimated the artistocracy at the soiree, and the characters barely survived - although one quite lost his mind.

Here the PCs have commandeered one of the many anti-air batteries scattered around London. It took quite a few barrages for it to finally fall. Fantasy Grounds VTT supported throwing ""only"" 30 dice at one time, so we ended up having to roll for damage in batches. They ended up dealing 12,461 HP of damage before the avatar went back to whence it came.

A few days later the same PC executed Edward VIII as part of the epilogue - another possession, or so he claims to this day. Later the whole thing was explained away by a German superweapon attacking London and their agents murdering the kings, so Weimar Republic took the blame. This paved the way for the eventual (expedited) rise of Hitler, more appeasement of Nazi Germany, and the start to an Achtung! Cthulhu campaign we're thirty sessions in, some players still using the same characters from the campaign in the 20s - if battle-weary and low on Sanity.

The PC who killed the two kings even met the next king George VI as the king personally launched a special section of the intelligence services at the onset of WWII to investigate the budding Nazi research into the Cthulhu Mythos. The king understandably has quite a keen interest in Cthulhu Mythos himself as a result of his dad and brother being murdered under rather curious circumstances. This time the king survived the encounter.

We couldn't be more thrilled how the image turned out! It captures the chaos of the scene, and even shows the PCs as I described them to Chris.

486,846,tv5qdm,Do not be afraid to switch your TTRPG System and try something new,"When I was twelve, we started playing TTRPGs. During the 90s in Germany, people played mostly ""das schwarze Auge"" (internationally known as ""the dark eye""), which is a d20 based Fantasy rpg, that was developed as something as an answer to DnD. I played this during my teen years in school and stuck to it during university after finding a new group of guys, who also all had started TTRPGs with the dark eye. We played in various group constallation till the end of university. People were always dropping in and out of the groups and we had the usual problems of people not showing up and a general fatigue in long running campaigns. 

Actually, most of the guys wanted to play but our first love with TTRPGs just did not work out anymore. Still, like sometimes in real live relationships, it took us years to understand and express what was actually bothering us with the dark eye (to complicated und clunky magic and combat, way to much bookkeeping in general). Finally, we decided to try something new. We switched to Shadowrun, which didn't sit well with us at all. Back to the dark eye for another year but still unsatisfied. 

Then, one day, a friend introduced us to Malifaux - Through the breach. No dice, just card flipping. Fewer rules and more focus on personal character Development.  After a short campaign with Malifaux, I mostly took over GMing. I ran a Calll of Cthulhu campaign (masks of Nyarlathotep), then two homebrewed Cyberpunk Red campaigns, a Cthulhu Pulp campaign (The two headed serpent) and right now we are in the middle of a Conam 2d20 campaign. 

Between each campaign, which all took 3 to 5 months, or on days when not everybody could attend, we did unrelated one shots in other, mostly rules light systems (Alien by free League, Paranoia, Brindlewood  bay).

In contrast to our neverending dark eye campaign,  the Limited lengths of our campaigns, coupled with regular switching of the system, resulted in a generally higher attendance, more motivation on both the player and the GM side and an open mind towards what is possible in TTRPGs in general. 

While this probably won't work for all groups, it changed to world of gaming for us. I do not want to tell you to switch your system just for changeing systems sake, but I cannot recommend enough, to not be afraid to leave behind an long used system and try something completely different.Just because you played [XXX] all your life, it does not or must not limit your gaming world to this one game.

Talk to your players, talk with your players and discover, what you would like to try out but never did. I twice did presentations on various other systems and finished with a poll, what my group would love to try next. You need not commit yourself forever to a new system, either.

488,848,abuhf1,The Best Premade Campaigns,"Hello there! I’m a voracious reader of whatever I can get my hands on, and for the last couple years I have been on an absolute kick of reading rpg campaigns. After consuming so many, I wanted to share what I view as the absolute top rung of the ladder.

&#x200B;

*13th Age- Eyes of the Stone Thief*: The conceit here is absolutely brilliant; What if the dungeons the PCs explore wasn’t just malevolent, but the main antagonist. What emerges is a megadungeon that actually feels alive and active that the players will alternately react to and against. It builds upon all of the strengths of the semi-improvisational nature of the system, and really lets the players loose.

&#x200B;

*Savage Worlds- 50 Fathoms/ Sundered Skies*: This is how you do a sandbox (more like wet/sky box, am I right?) Jam Packed with content, be a pirate.

&#x200B;

*Call of Cthulhu-Beyond the Mountains of Madness*: If CoC can be counted upon for doing one thing, it is turning out amazing adventure after amazing adventure. While the weakest of the mega-campaigns of the system with a agonizingly slow pace in the first half, the second is so exceedingly strong that it is well worth the ride.

&#x200B;

*Call of Cthulhu- Horror On The Orient Express:* Plenty of campaigns struggle with making sure that the players will willingly go along with the adventure. Some will make a sandbox, expecting the GM to make up the rest. Others will simply disguise their nature and move along with modular design. This adventure says “Fuck that” and puts the game on a literal railroad. It is glorious.

&#x200B;

*Call of Cthulhu- Masks of Nyarlathotep*: What can be said about this that hasn’t already been written? Each edition’s rendition of the masterwork improves upon it even more, without ever making it feel bloated or dated. Not only is it a contender for the greatest premade adventure of all time, it is one of the greatest pulp adventure works ever written. A masterpiece in every sense of the word.

&#x200B;

*Call of Cthulhu- The Things We Leave Behind*: Look, this one is a bit of a cheat. There isn’t a clear way to string these together, and they weren’t really meant to be. However, as a released compendium this contains some of the finest modules I have encountered. *Forget Me Not* alone is worth the price of admission.

&#x200B;

*Chuubo’s Marvelous Wish Granting Engine*\- *The Glass-Maker’s Dragon*: The system itself might be overly complicated and frustrating to play, but this supplement is staggering in its imagination in regards to the product’s ambition.

&#x200B;

*Deadlands Reloaded- The Flood/ Last Sons*: Weird West fiction at its finest, these are unique with their willingness to allow homebrew. I haven’t read the other campaigns in the line, but if they reach the quality of these two then I’ll be plenty impressed. Yee-haw.

&#x200B;

*Delta Green- A Night At The Opera*: Look, another flagrant violation of the undisclosed rules. This scenario book contains hands-down the best scenario writing I have ever read with each module presenting a distinctly themed joint of horror. The best horror system around always strive to be even better.

&#x200B;

*Degenesis Rebirth- Jehammed’s Will* (*In Thy Blood*, *The Killing Game*, *Black Atlantic*): The epic saga of possibly the finest post-apocalyptic system ever released. Gorgeously detailed and meticulous written this takes second place of my favorite premise campaign. Come for the production values, stay for the brutality.

*Dungeons & Dragons- Night Below*: TSR’s swansong, this epic campaign demonstrates just how good the cornerstone of rpgs can be when in the right hands and why it has stayed around for so long. Also has the best representation of the Underdark, period.

&#x200B;

*Dungeons & Dragons- Curse of Strahd*: Ravenloft is often held up as the best D&D module, yet this 5E campaign takes its place as the pinnacle of what the venerated system’s lineage can do. 

*Heroquest- Sartyr Kingdom of Heroes*: This is what sword and sorcery campaigns should strive to be, what they can be if they are unashamed of their roots. If you love games that are willing to just be fun, then you owe it to yourself to read this.

&#x200B;

*King Arthur Pendragon- The Pendragon Campaign*: Some say that this is the best that prewritten material has ever been, and it is hard to disagree. With a vision so far above most other works, the magnum opus of Greg Strafford is a venerable classic.

&#x200B;

*Kult- The Black Madonna/ Judas Grail*: These right here are the peak of what horror rpgs can be. Dark, disturbing, sick, and sacrilegious they all cross several lines, yet never feel gratuitous  Read these if  you wish to experience a world where reality itself has gone wrong. With the advent of *Divinity Lost*, *The Black Madonna*  has become even better.

&#x200B;

*Lamentations of the Flame Princess- The Red and Pleasant Land/ Better Than Any Man/ Deep Carbon Observatory*: There is much to be said about LotFP. Criticisms about its edginess and lack of subtly have been risen. Yet there is no way to deny that each of these are so superbly written it is hard to to notice those complaints.

&#x200B;

*Legend of Five Rings- City Of Lies*: This is, hands down, the best location ever created in the history of rpgs. Every part of the city is detailed, and the campaign itself matches that quality. Required reading.

&#x200B;

*Mekton- Operation Rimfire*: Anime as hell, it still packs plenty of heart. If you enjoy all the excesses of classic sci-fi and 90’s anime, then at least give this a cursory glance.

&#x200B;

*Night’s Black Agents- The Zalozhniy Quartet*: Another day, another compilation book that can be strung into an excellent campaign. Features the best heist ever in rpgs, and a fantastic villain. Would be the best improv campaign if not for...

&#x200B;

*Night’s Black Agents- The Dracula Dossier*: Look, this thing, this magnificent thing, is a titan. A veritable behemoth of writing, there is just so much here to unpack. Every page bursts with ideas that could fuel an entire campaign, that could serve as something sessions of fun on their own. The only downside is just how much of a niche styled GM you have to be to run it. If you do the ability though there is nothing else quite like it.

&#x200B;

*The One Ring- The Darkening of Mirkwood*: A smaller, more intimate version of Greg Strafford’s classic, this campaign captures just what is so magical and visionary about the words of J.R.R. Tolkien. Combine with *Heart of the Wild* and *Tales From the Wilderland* for a beast of a work.

&#x200B;

*Orpheus- The Orpheus Campaign*: The forgotten child of WoD, this line of six books deserves more recognition as the fantastically realized world that it creates. A pseudo-sequel to the best WoD material, *Orpheus* is lovely in every way. The most underrated campaign in the entirety of rpgs.

&#x200B;

*OSR- Maze of the Blue Medusa/ Hot Springs Island/ Stonehell*: Another cheat to lump all of these together, but I could not find out any other way to speak of the importance of these three. The apex of the OSR philosophies, these crawlers are packed with puzzles and difficult encounters.

&#x200B;

*Paranoia- Yellow Clearance box Blues*: There is plenty of great modules written for this system, but this stands as the “obvious” best. Melding *Paranoia*’s classic writing with modern design sensibilities and the power of rock, this scenario is a beating blast.

&#x200B;

*Pathfinder- Kingmaker/ Age of Worms/ Curse of the Crimson Throne*: It is hard not to respect Paizo for their efforts in keeping the structured premise campaigns alive when they were near abandoned in the late 00’s. These are their best efforts, the adventures that deserve to stand alongside the classics.

&#x200B;

*Pathfinder- Way of the Wicked*: The second best fan campaign ever made for an rpg, this evil adventure has several issues, but the concept alone is worth checking out. It really captures what it means to be an overlord fighting against the forces of good.

&#x200B;

*Pathfinder/ D&D 4E/ D&D 5E- Zeitgeist*: One of my favorite videos games ever created in an rpg called *Arcanum*. A steampunk fantasy meld it is about the dawning of a new age, the struggle of hierarchies, and the nature of faith. *Zeitgeist* here is the only equivalent I have been able to find. An absolute unit of a campaign, it stands as the greatest fan made campaign ever.

&#x200B;

*Runequest- Griffin Mountain:* An essential ancient campaign that many modern adventures draw their inspiration from. Holds up remarkably well, and still has some surprises hidden inside. 

&#x200B;

*Star Wars (WEG)- Operation Elrood*: “Let’s board a star destroyer, and blow it up!” Demonstrates why this franchise has stuck around for forty-odd years.

&#x200B;

*Trail of Cthulhu- Eternal Lies*: The modern rival to Mister Gnarly’s *Masks*, this campaign is explosively impressive. A fine mystery, a pulp adventure, and plenty of twists. The best campaign of the last decade.

&#x200B;

*Trail of Cthulhu- Cthulhu City*: Much like the campaign books of *Degenesis*, this work is part source book and part adventure. A love letter to the Weird, with more hooks than Lake Champlain in the summer.

&#x200B;

*Traveller- Pirates of Drinax*: This here is the finest, largest, mindboggingly detailed sandbox I have ever encountered. Could supply a decade of content easily.

&#x200B;

*Unknown Armies 2E- TO GO*: My favorite setting, my favorite system, my favorite campaign. A fantastic (road/head/ road head) trip across the American gestalt.

&#x200B;

*WFRP- The Enemy Within*: The fans say this is the finest adventure ever written, and the detractors will grudgingly admit that it is certainly impressive. A wondrous achievement in adventure writing, the promise of it being modernized and bettered looms on the horizon.",rpg,1546443828.0,0,9895,1638
489,849,7g5xta,Running a campaign with elderly characters.,"I am currently running a Pathfinder campaign for the most creative kids I’ve ever met. A few months ago, my cousin, who is about 13, asked me if I could run an TTRPG for him and his friends. I gave them the regular sales pitch of games and in a unanimous decision they decided Pathfinder was the game for them. 

Little did I know, they would all play elderly characters… I’m talking a 300 hundred year old elf ranger, a 200 year old dwarf barbarian, a 75 year old human cleric, and a 125 year old gnome wizard. 

Being a very lenient gm when it comes to character creations I allowed this with the usual bonuses and penalties; -2 to strength and + 3 on wisdom, that sort of thing. But when I heard their back story I almost died. 
In their own words, it goes like this: 

Nearly 40 years ago now, Tadak the elven ranger led his band of mercenaries on a quest so epic… It would make and enemy for life. After spending nearly 10 years together looting dungeons, protecting villages, and rescuing babes, “Wolf’s Fang Mercenaries for Hire” accepted the job of destroying Madicore the necromancer. Of course, in their prime this was a simple job for the heroes, and luckily this set them up for life following the quests success. They retired to their respected countries of origin and there they lived telling stories of their adventures to the families they soon had. Each lived a happy and peaceful life, they watched their kids grow up and eventually come together into a new group of adventures.

All was well, until one fateful night It first started with Hamon the Cleric having a dream of his son being taken by their old foe, Madicore. The dream trickled down the line to Ganoosh the Gnome(for his daughter), Diado the Dwarf(for his son), and finally Tadak the elf(for his son). Soon they found these dreams to be true, Madicore had returned and he had taken our heroes children, to no one knows where. 
In agreement for one last adventure the heroes 4 decided to band together to save their kids and trully put an end to Madicore the necromancer.  End.

I was so lost in the beauty of this story that I couldn’t help but let it be. I wrote their first campaign around this story as well, in which the magic truly ensued. On several raids to necromancer ruins the players would pretend to be old and frail, in hopes of being taken captive. Once inside the dungeons at the bowels of enemy camps they would break out and wreak havoc upon their enemies. Eventually, word would spread throughout the world, making even the quickest of rogues fear picking the pockets of old people. 

In instances of critical failures, they would attribute them to their old age. For Tadak, failing a ranged attack would be his arthritis kicking in and for Ganoosh he would get sudden dry mouth making it hard to pronounce his spells. The best, in my opinion, was for Diado every time he failed a roll, his waning mind would cause him to forget where he was and what he was doing; which would only send him into a rage. I’m looking forward to see how the end fight goes.

Basically the idea is after an extremely raucous celebration the Dwarves have drunk all the beer in the Hold.

Or the PCs go full Patrick and go on a whodunnit trying to find the missing beer\theives with evidence constantly pointing to themselves but they just ignore that and keep finding new leads.

For the first one they can either try to figure out a way to brew it all, or using a Dwarven scholars new discovery (30 years ago), realize there's giant space clouds made of beer and beating up some nerds to get a spaceship\get parts to build one.

When I started playing D&D in 1979, I was terrified that my character would die. We were all very new to the hobby and character death was the worst thing I could imagine. Then my character died and was resurrected. Death, for many players, became a mini-game like shopping. The impermanence removed the fear and without the fear there were no meaningful stakes.

Within two years RPGs were everywhere. Sci Fi, Superhero, Westerns, and so many D&D imitators. By 1982 almost every game had a way to resurrect characters or mitigate death in most cases. Death had no sting.

It was Superhero games that taught me how to raise the stakes without killing a character. The only way to threaten a Superhuman was to go after the things they loved. Put the things they value at risk and suddenly they are afraid. Tension is built when we hope for one outcome and fear another. Drama is built when we want something, and another person denies it to us.

Here are some real-life examples from play:

Example 1: *The superhero team is roleplaying a Christmas party for their characters. They are alerted to a major crisis. They are joined by a few superhero NPCs that were at their party. They all leave to deal with the crisis. At the end of the battle one of the NPCs has been killed and the other is in a coma. The PCs return to their base and see all of the Christmas decorations.*

This was a scene that left the characters broken. The Christmas party was like ashes in their mouths. Then spent five sessions hunting the villains and had to balance their sense of justice and their need for revenge.

Example 2: *The players are big damn heroes. They have been using a small village as their base of operations for a while. They know the names of 20 or so NPCs. They have the NPCs join their war council as advisors. One of the advisors was turned by their enemy. During the council meeting the betrayer suicide bombs the meeting. The PCs are barely harmed. The Councilor NPCs have less than 8 hit points each. The NPCs are instantly vaporized. Did I mention the PCs are big damn heroes? They are the highest level characters in the world (other than their enemy). The PCs can't Raise Dead or Resurrect. Those NPCs are gone. The players wept.*

This scene drove the players to redouble the efforts in their war on the enemy. Every battle was fought in the name of the fallen victims. They held funerals for the dead. They felt real emotions and they were realized that betrayal was an option.

Example 3: The players were going dungeon crawling into the tomb of a dead god. They were warned that anyone below a certain level of power (\*class level) *would die instantly. The players couldn't risk taking anyone with them. The cleric entered the tomb first. He was unharmed. From within his backpack there was a small \*squeak\* and the remains of the cleric's pet hedgehog sifted out and onto the floor. I picked up the hedgehog toy I had given the player and dropped it in the trash-can.*

This was a real moment for all the players. It changed the way they viewed the world. They realized how frail and impermanent NPCs (and pets) were. The PC went so far as to bargain with the God of Death for the life of the pet.

All of these examples have been called shocking and monstrous by people. That's because they work. My players know that they have to protect what matters to them. They are willing to sacrifice the life of their characters to do it. That's the point. They became heroes because they discovered that there was something worth dying for.

Attack their home base. Kill their favorite NPC. Have a loyal retainer betray them. Make combat challenging.  Make character death meaning and a player's choice. That's how you raise the stakes.

503,868,8tg142,"Okay, I'm absolutely hooked on Ironsworn's solo gameplay","As someone with no nerdy friends in real life (well, at least not the type of nerd who would play tabletop games), I have read far more rulebooks than I actually get the chance to play. I'm sure that's a familiar story for a lot of you here. Out of frustration, I have in the past tried to get into solo roleplaying but bounced off it. Being particularly bored this week with most of my friends out of town while I'm home working, I decided to give it another go and really drive myself to get into it. 

After spending a good chunk of yesterday evening reading through the surprisingly high-quality Ironsworn manual (available at https://www.ironswornrpg.com/), I decided I was going to spend a couple hours of my day off today, which is usually video-gaming time, to start up a quick solo run to figure out the mechanics.

Instead, I essentially just finished up a 10-hour solo session, where I only took breaks to stretch and eventually go make dinner. This is by *far* the best game designed with solo play in mind that I have ever come across. I'm a little skeptical about how good it would be in the traditional GM-guided format (mostly due to the lack of GM moves), but I haven't tried it. That said, I think the things that I would anticipate being lost from the guided experience are the exact things that tend to hold solo hacks of other games back. Because Ironsworn's GM does very little other than interpreting the narrative and providing story, it's much more easily simulated through oracles than other games. Some examples of things I particularly like:

* Ironsworn's initiative system is pretty straightforward. Either you have initiative, which means you get to act *proactively*, or your opponent has initiative, which means you have to act *reactively*. What's important, though, is that every single interaction comes with a player move. Where a solo gamer would normally have to choose what ""move"" the NPC made on their turn, Ironsworn's mechanics hold that NPC damage is simply a result of failed dice rolls on the player's reactive moves. That means all the solo player has to do is fill in the narrative framing for what exactly that damage looked like. 

* Because Ironsworn is designed for solo play, it has oracles that are setting-specific. This is a pretty minor thing in the big picture, but it has really substantially improved my immersion and oracle use vs. trying to hack something with Mythic.

* Ironsworn's very explicit quest mechanics constantly drive player action forward. You always have either a goal (in the form of an Iron Vow), or the drive to get a goal (and thus take on a quest), because you can only gain experience through the completion of Vows. This provides the forward pressure on the narrative that is normally provided by a GM -- the main problem I've had in solo before is that the narrative often stalls out. Ironsworn's use of varying ranks of Vows (including a huge Background Vow that you may or may not slowly progress on through your game) provide constant direction for the moments where you get lost. If you've fulfilled all your vows, it's either time to retire or it means you've got to go exploring. 

* This game is actually pretty hard. I was really not expecting this, because usually rules-light games have a tendency to be easier, and solo games further have a tendency to be easier due to the unavoidable effects of first-person bias. Ironsworn is basically always beating up your character, however -- something that really drives home the vibe of the game's setting, which is of a resource-scarce land where life is hard and humanity is barely hanging on for life. Three misses on *Undertake a Journey* in a row and you're going to find yourself carefully planning out how to make it to a waypoint where you can rest up without dying. 

* Assets are a pretty cool implementation of a classless system -- wish there were more, though. Their mechanics seem pretty straightforward, so it should be possible to create new ones rather easily, though. Furthermore, they all follow pretty consistent numeric balancing, meaning it should be a good bit harder to accidentally create underpowered/overpowered customs.

* The rulebook is seriously just great. For a completely free game it's very appealing, and I was unironically invested in the outcome of the several story examples presented throughout.

Alright, done ranting now. Just wanted to share because I'm very excited and I can't mention that I played a tabletop game by myself to any of the people I know IRL without getting weird looks. ",rpg,1529821505.0,0,4570,786

Also, the system requires you to have lots of story tags on your characters and the world (often written on note cards) which everyone has to keep track of in order to play optimally.

Obviously these can be selling points for plenty of RPGers, but they can be a very unpleasant surprise for a player like me who was expecting a simple system to run any genre (which is how it's often pitched) rather than a high-narrative, low-immersion storygame (which is what it turned out to be).",rpg,1496162818.0,0,915,166

* The local ORSK should feel like an oppressive vault of niceness. Located well outside the nearest town and framed by a lake of cement, this blue-white megastore offers shoppers everything they need to make a space a home. 
* Shoppers are guided through its showroom, market place and self-serving warehouse by a long and winding path that induces retail hypnosis. Even ORSK employees (or “partners”, as they’re called by Corporate) sometimes need to concentrate in order to not get lost. 
* Within its walls, ORSK has no windows, skylights or clocks. Like a casino, it exists in an eternal now. Of course, there’s also little to no cell phone reception.
* Aside from the retail floors, ORSK has a restaurant (whose meatballs are actually quite good) and a Scandinavian Food Market (where no food actually comes from Scandinavia). 
* Behind the scenes, there’s various break rooms, a larger storage warehouse, a basement and freight elevators. There’s one way to the store manager’s offices upstairs above the showroom. 

**THREATS**

* Whereas the threat in the original novel was a \[spin on the supernatural “haunted house” trope\], my adventure features “Projekt Drön” – an attempt by Corporate to create the perfect worker. 
* Drön are pure cyborg bodyhorror. They seem humanoid from a distance (because they once were humans), but land smack-dab in the uncanny valley the closer you get. When Drön speak, they don’t move their mouths. They unhinge their jaws and play pre-recorded stock phrases (“Thank you for shopping at ORSK”, “The store is closing, please proceed to the exit”, “Do you have an ORSK family card?”). 
* As the night progresses, their appearance should become more horrific, with limbs elongating or shortening, muscles bulging obscenely and flesh peeling off, revealing metallic mesh and sinews beneath. They will hunt the players down – your choice either to kill them or use them as raw material to make more Drön.
* The ORSK store should become more and more deadly as the game progresses. Start by cutting off shortcuts in the floor plan, make furniture shatter and fall, have storage racks squash them…

**QUESTIONNAIRES**

I’ve made the player questionnaires look like job application forms for ORSK. 

As it was a con game for a max of 5 players, I kept it short – 12 questions each. 

I started off with *setting questions* (“Why do you wanna work here? ; “What’s your favorite ORSK piece of furniture” ; “How would you describe your work ethos?”), then ventured into *background questions* (“You’re overqualified for this job. Why do you still need it?” ; “What made you leave your hometown so abruptly?” ; “A part of the store lets you shudder. Which one, and why?”), turned the screw towards the personal (“Why wasn’t your mother proud of you?” ; “Why can’t you let others see the real you?”), and finally cranked up the *unease towards Corporate and the feeling of entrapment* (“Why is true that a person’s worth is based on their efficiency?” ; “If a person is dependent on their job, wouldn’t they be well to follow Corporate’s orders?”). 

At the end, players should feel their character’s *inability to just up and quit* – either because there are no better jobs available, or because the neatness of ORSK provides a security blanket for their neurosis or what have you. 

**NPCs**

* Basil, the supervisor (mandatory). Basil loves his job at ORSK, as his benefits pay for his little sister’s medication (he is her sole guardian). Basil also likes the PCs and wants them to succeed. He might get promoted soon, he heard, and would love for one of them to a rise to a higher position as well. Besides the store manager, Basil is the only one in possession of an Override key that can deactivate a store-wide lockdown.
* Matthew (optional), one of the storehouse workers. Ethnically ambiguous. His beard is the last thing a craft beer sees before it dies. Matt has never encountered a conspiracy theory he didn’t like, so you take his ramblings about “corporate replacing us all with automatons” with a grain of salt.
* Trinity Prendergast (optional), co-worker and resident MySpace goth. Her family is \*really\* into pageants, so her look is aimed squarely at riling her mom up. Her first and last act at work is wiping off and reapplying black lipstick, respectively. 
* Ruth Anne, the good soul of this ORSK (optional). She’s been doing odd jobs all her life, with ORSK being by far her favorite. Kind, communal and protective, but can pack a punch when cornered. If she has a vice, it’s strawberry flavored chapstick. Looks like if your older aunt was cosplaying as Dolly Parton.
* Michael, the drifter (optional). Has lost his home, and his family, during the financial crisis and sleeps in the store. Michael can be used as a red herring to explain the strange things during the night… except he’s been here far shorter than those.
* The raccoon (optional). Another red herring for the player’s to find before they encounter the real threat.
* Tom Perssons, CEO of ORSK North America. All-American sweetheart turned corporate. Pomenade and teeth whitener made human. His picture hangs in every ORSK, but no one has actually seen Tom in real life. 

**ADVENTURE STRUCTURE**

**Part I**

After a mysterious shipment of new prototype furniture is delivered, the store suffers from weird acts of nightly vandalisms. Players are tasked with spending an extra night shift to get to the bottom of it. 

In this part, GMs should introduce characters and a general sense of unease towards Corporate. Mention slogans that seem both cheery and ominous at the same time (“ORSK: A home, forever!” ; (“ORSK partners: Our most valuable resource” etc.), “Employees of the Month” that you’ve never seen in the store (they’re either been “promoted” or switched stores) and that despite the spotless façade, your ORSK is in dire need of some repairs. It should also become apparent that ORSK is cutting costs by firing the cleaning and security staff. 

Of course, the mysterious shipment are DRÖN compartments. After they’ve been put in the basement, this part of the store will become off-limits for employees due to a “leak”. Mention a rotting, electrical stench emanating from behind the doors. 

**Part II**

The store shuts down for a national holiday – which means there’s no shoppers or staff coming for a few days. Perfect time to hunt for vandals. Characters get more than what they’ve bargained for. 

Use the first section of this part to (further) develop a sense of camaraderie between characters and introduce the red herring. Generate a feeling of paranoia and uncanniness. Whereas the ORSK is well-lit and pleasant during the day, at night the scenery – with the lights off and no white noise playing – plays with and confuses your senses. 

When players have encountered the red herring and are ready to call it in, guide them towards the store manager’s office. Shortly before they reach it, have the Drön show up first and claim Basil and additional victims, if applicable. End this part of the adventure with players discovering a case file for “Projekt Drön”. 

**Part III**

After discovering the “Projekt Drön” video, characters need to find Basil (or what’s left of him) so they can get the Override switch and escape the ORSK. To do so, they have to cross the floors of ORSK that the Drön have turned into death traps, get into the basement and survive long enough to make it to the exit. 

\------

**DID YOU USE PROPS?**  
Yeah. As I’ve mentioned, the questionnaires looked like job applications; I’ve photoshopped and printed out an actual IKEA Store map. The original “Horrorstör” novel also provides some nifty and appropriately creepy furniture artwork. A quick Google Image search will help you out.   


**WHAT CHANGES DID YOU MAKE FROM THE ORIGINAL NOVEL?**  
The threat, mainly. The original book is basically a>! fun take on the ""haunted house"" trope!<, I thought I'd play up the callousness of Corporate and invented new villains to match my intent.

**If you don't know my work, here's an explanation about who I am and what's my passion :**

I'm a music composer and DM. I always struggled to find high quality ambiences, so I decided to create my own and make them available for free for everyone to use on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MichaelGhelfi?sub_confirmation=1). I strongly believe we needs more than just words to create the most immersive experience for our dear players. Some of us use miniatures, some have cosplays. Me, I use sounds :)

You can find them here : [Ambiences Playlist (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbHUA-o_5dgJbOXwtdVx--gTnmWfiyyys)

**What to expect :**

* Masterfully mixed and mastered (I got the proficiency bonus :))
* Professional quality sounds
* Standardized volume (the more I could) so you don't have to play the DJ while you DM
* **Three** new ambiences per week. On Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. Sometimes I upload songs or VLOGs, but that's rarer.
* They arrive on Spotify as loads of 50 ambiences at once (can't upload more frequently, it costs a lot to upload there)
* Completely free on my YouTube channel
* If you are a streamer or if you make YouTube videos, you can freely monetize your content using my ambiences. I just ask for proper credits, not more ;)

Feel free to ask if you don't find what you need. I'll add your proposition to my TODO list (if it's doable and is useful for all).

If you prefer to download the ambiences, you can get them [here](https://michaelghelfi.bandcamp.com/), but there's no premium content if you pay since I don't want richer people to have any advantage or bonus.

I hope that will help :)

&#x200B;

First time for me posting here, so I really hope it won't be received as self-promo spam.

Some background first: I'm a gamedev (worked on **Dead Cells**) but also a huge fan of tabletop RPGs (mostly DD5, Cthulhu & FFG Star Wars recently). But I've always add the same issue when making scenarios as a GM: it's easy to use stuff like GoogleDocs for the text part, but making maps always was an issue for me. In *my opinion*, most tools have either terrible UI, ergonomics or ugly look and it was hard finding something **light** and **efficient** at the same time.

So years ago I decided to make my own tool which was Flash based.

&#x200B;

Recently, I've release a whole new version of this tool which gets rid of Flash, but also integrates the tons of feedback previous users gave to me, such as special walls, lightings, ground textures and so on.

Here it is: [https://deepnight.net/tools/rpg-map/](https://deepnight.net/tools/rpg-map/)

&#x200B;

**Important**: my goal is to build a **light & simple tool**, for the GM to quickly draw maps for its campaign of *whatever* RPG. That's why you will never see furniture like Beds or Tables, but more generic things like rectangles. I try to stay **RPG agnostic** here.

All your feedback will be super valuable to me :)

&#x200B;

**Note**: it's still an *Alpha*, so expect changes and I can't guarantee the future compatibility of your created maps for now (not before *Beta* phase).

Stuff I plan to implement in the future:

* Downloadable Windows executable (not sure about a downloadable Mac version yet)
* Support for importing TSV files (any other format I should know about?)
* Water/lava/acid pools
* More skins, ground textures, icons & furniture
* Multi-language support (English/French at first)
* Open-source on GitHub",rpg,1558174305.0,0,2290,367
514,888,2vehsh,I'm a GM who kicked half his players out of the group... and I couldn't be happier with the results.,"I've been running a GURPS campaign that takes place in a semi-steampunk fantasy world of my own design. It's the first campaign I've ever run as a GM, and I chose GURPS because it seemed like the best choice for what I was trying to do. Most of the time I had six players, but three of them were guilty of being ""that guy"" in three different ways, so I stopped inviting them. Now my campaign is the best it's ever been and we're all happy. Now let me tell you why.



One of the players, who I'll refer to as ""snake girl,"" was really proud of being a sex-addicted warrior woman with a pet snake. That would have been cool, if it weren't for the fact that she never brought anything to the table besides that. She never showed any interest in the game world, quests, or anything beyond wanting to shag every NPC on their airship crew and asking if her snake can bite someone in combat. Even that would have been ok, if not for the fact that she also spent most of the time talking about off topic stuff, singing, yelling out memes, and trying to get the Senpai of the group to notice her. Most of the time she couldn't catch anything that was actually going on with the campaign, because she didn't pay attention until there was combat and it was her character's turn.



The other ""that guy"" was much worse. Imagine having a rules lawyer who isn't particularly good at rules or being a lawyer. Of course, most players understand that phrase ""the GM is always right,"" and GURPS even says that it's ok to change things for the sake of a campaign. This guy didn't seem to get that. He would bring the GURPS rulebook to every session and keep it open, and any time I made a ruling that might not benefit him, he'd say something like ""Oh, let me look that up,"" then turn to the appropriate page in the book to ""check"" and see what I should have done. If I've contradicted the default rules (or if I didn't, but he misread them and thought I did), he'd ""correct"" me and narrate what should have happened instead, which is awfully stupid considering that often times he's looking up rules that I've purposely changed or omitted for the sake of our game. Every time he did this, he'd break the flow of the game and ruin everyone's immersion, in addition to causing further confusion for the rest of the players (even when simplified, GURPS has a lot to it). It got pretty aggravating having someone constantly questioning everything I do and undermining my authority as a GM. He also seemed to get off on frequently interrupting me to ask questions that put me on the spot, like ""What's the name of the preferred dish in this town?"" or ""what does the engine room of their airship look like? I ask them to let me explore it!"" Often times he'd be disrupting actual story content to do this. I had a talk with him, but he didn't seem to get it. He just claimed he was trying to help me ""grow as a GM."" On top of that, his character was a total ripoff of the eels guy from The Mighty Boosh, and his in-character behavior consisted almost entirely of talking about eels and asking for eels while doing that guy's voice. That got old very fast, and his character had no value in the party or the campaign.



Our last ""that guy"" was a stoner who had to be high as a kite every time we played. His character was a ""Nazi scientist"" in a world without Nazis, and he showed little interest in acting like a functional member of the party; he was just one of those ""look at what a character I am"" characters. He wanted to turn people into zombies, so I tried making it fun for him by having him occasionally find devices that would allow him to do that, but he was too high to ever actually pick up on it. The worst, though, was when the players were fighting an epic battle onboard a pirate ship, and an unexpected challenge appeared. Even though everyone else was willing to rise up to the challenge, he got really pissed off and started yelling at me about how that's so unfair, how it's not physically possible (he's a self-proclaimed physicist), and I'm totally trying to get the whole party killed (no...). It was impossible to continue the game at that point; he basically shut it down, and he never apologized for that outburst. He just told me on Facebook later on that what I did was ""fucking retarded.""




So what did I do? I stopped inviting Snake Girl, Rules Lawyer *and* Stoner Boy, and have been continuing the campaign with the three people I have left. The fun factor has improved more than a thousand times over! Now our game sessions are all roleplaying, character development, plot advancement and a splash of fun, easily manageable combat. The three players I have left work as a team, Three Musketeers-style, and have thrilling in-character banter as they make important decisions, execute daring maneuvers, and deal with the situations I present them with in interesting ways. Most importantly, they're having more fun now and are accessing the game world and the game system with greater ease. I no longer have to spend any time fighting to keep everyone's attention; I don't have to worry about narrating something that will remind them of a meme that they have to shout out, and we spend 0 time fussing about the rules or arguing about technicalities. For having fun in a table top RPG, good players are just as important as a good GM.




If you're a GM who suffers from having one or more ""that guy"" in your group making you miserable, you should seriously consider leaving them in the dust, for the sake of your campaign and for the players you like. And if you're a player who's guilty of any of the annoying and disruptive behaviors similar to what I've described (rules lawyering, undermining the GM, or derailing the game just to share dank memes), you may want to change your ways quick - or before you know it, you might just stop being welcome at that table.




TL;DR: Players - don't be That Guy. GMs: Don't tolerate That Guy. Stop inviting him; you'll be happier, and the rest of your players will thank you for it.",rpg,1423560284.0,0,6036,1107

516,895,lzs60b,Is it valid to enjoy RPG without much role-playing?,"When I was much younger than I am now, I used to really enjoy RPGs. Things I remember liking about them include:

* beating the challenges presented by combat encounters;
* creative problem-solving and investigative work in non-combat situations;
* sense of progression as my character levels up and becomes more powerful;
* (as a secondary consideration) witnessing the story-telling and the world-building done by the GM, and possibly doing some of that myself at my own pace.

At the same time, I specifically did not (and do not now) enjoy role-playing and (for lack of a better term) being charismatic. I prefer to have conversations out-of-character, at least at my end (e.g. I'd prefer to say ""I greet the NPC"" as opposed to saying ""I turn to NPC and say *'Hello!'*""; I don't have a strong preference as to whether GM replies ""The NPC greets you back"" or ""The NPC says *'Hello, traveller!'*"".). I like the fact that I can in principle have an elaborate back-story, but it's important to me that I'm allowed to keep it to a bare minimum (""I was orphaned when I was a child, a wizard took me in as his apprentice, now I'm ready to go adventuring.""). I get mildly uncomfortable when GM asks me to describe in detail what my outfit looks like or how I strike the finishing blow in a combat situation, especially when this has no effect on the mechanics of the game.

I've recently been trying to get back into RPGs, and in several unrelated instances in a row I encountered people who emphasise the role-playing/charismatic aspects of the game over the parts that I personally enjoy, and haven't yet had much luck with finding like-minded people. Since my experience with RPGs is limited and mostly set far in the past, this makes me question: *Is my approach to RPGs even valid?* Is it reasonable for me to hope to find a group whose play-style better fits my preferences, or should I just accept that RPGs are fundamentally different than what I enjoy? Are my preferences a matter of a legitimate difference in tastes, or am I simply being unsophisticated and/or misguided?

(In some basic sense, I'm aware that my preferences are obviously valid, in the sense that anything is valid if everyone involved is having fun. An analogy that comes to mind: There is nothing wrong with liking fast-food more than French cuisine, just like there is nothing wrong with liking Indian cuisine more than French cuisine. However, if I expressed these two preferences, I would expect rather different responses. I'm basically asking whether in this analogy I'm a fast-food enthusiast or an Indian food enthusiast.)

Any insight would be very much appreciated!

Also, just to pre-empt the obvious comment: Yes, I am quite aware that ""RP"" in RPG stands for ""role-playing"" ;)

EDIT TO ADD: I'd like to clarify one point in which I might have not expressed myself clearly. While I do enjoy combat, I also very much enjoy non-combat related activities. I'm not specifically looking to hack and slash. Conducting an investigation or solving a riddle or resolving a conflict are also definitely things I like. I'm just more excited about figuring the solution from 3rd person perspective than in role-playing the interactions that are involved in it.

Also, thank you for all the responses!",rpg,1615128928.0,0,3274,561
517,896,bi4e5d,My first game as a GM had 42 players,"I'm a French computer engineering student (I hope, by the way, that my English is not too bad) and I went, in 2017, in Thailand for an internship in a Thai engineering school. I was there with two French friends of mine, whom I will call Lisa and Rachel, and we were the three only French in an 41-people Thai class. Lisa was a GM and was the one person who gave me the passion for tabletop RPG, and Rachel had never played any tabletop RPG game yet.

&#x200B;

One of our classes was an oral expression class, about how to properly speak to an assembly. One of the simple exercises was to explain to the other students our hobbies. During my presentation, I told that I liked tabletop RPGs ; at the end, the teacher asked me what ""RPG"" was. I was like ""Yeah he is about 40, of course he doesn't know!"" and I started explaining (for 20 minutes), when I understood that there wasn't any student who had ever heard about RPGs.

&#x200B;

During the next week, with Lisa and Rachel we were like ""Wow that's funny, RPGs absolutely don't exist here! Maybe we can ask to Thai students if they want to try one day!""

&#x200B;

At the end of the next expression class, we asked the teacher if we could offer students to join us in a RPG initiation. He said of course, and we told the class that we were willing to give to some students an opportunity to try tabletop RPG, so if like 6 people wanted to try, that was the occasion. The teacher immediately asked us if we wanted to take half an hour in the next class to play with the students to show them, as RPG could be considered as an expression exercise. We said that it would be an honor, but half an hour is kinda short. The teacher gave us 1 hour of the next class to play.

&#x200B;

r/WTF is happening right now

&#x200B;

We spent the whole next week to figure out how to make an 1-hour game with 43 people (with Lisa and Rachel among the players, and I as the GM). We came up with a really simple rule system to explain in 5 minutes, with 7 characters played by 6 people each, and the choice between 4 scenarios :

\- The Mansion : an old abandonned mansion filled with monsters and traps contains a princess to free. Very classical, maybe the best to discover tabletop RPG (a very simple scenario, I know, but we had 1 hour including rules teaching)

\- The Arena : the characters are thrown in an arena to fight monsters, then to kill each other in order to win (more fight-oriented)

\- The lighthouse : the players are harpoon fishers whose boat sank near an abandonned lighthouse hiding an old scientific lair with a big monster inside : the goal is to find a radio emitter to call a nearby boat

\- The psychopath : a very dirty game where the players are chased down by a psychopath in his house, have almost no weapon and try to find a way out

&#x200B;

At the beginning of the next class, the teacher said that he wanted to give us the full 4-hours class to play ( r/thatescalatedquickly). The students chose the Mansion scenario and we played for 4 hours maybe the funniest but most tiring game of my life.

Playing with 42 unexperienced people is VERY hard. The first thing they did was to split in the mansion (so I had to improvise 7 paths in the mansion (one per character instead of one for the group)), so I had to call Lisa to become a second GM to help me, they did some very bad choices (luring a giant spider to close combat when you are a crossbowman, then setting it on fire when it is laying on you, for example), but some outstanding moves (because managing 42 fully-working brains is almost impossible without being outsmarted, even with unexperimented players).

&#x200B;

At the end, they saved the princess but sacrified 3 team members to do so, therefore I think the game was kind of balanced :)

&#x200B;

It was very tiring but I will remember this my whole life ; most of them loved it even if they found that 42 players was a bit too much (very true) and I hope they will remember and spread the concept!",rpg,1556403885.0,0,4001,753
518,899,dkvjkv,My space marine killed a hive tyrant during a blood rain,"I just finished the most metal rpg session ever.

We were playing DeathWatch, an RPG set in the warhammer 40k universe, where we played Space Marines  Super Soldiers. We were playing the introduction mission, which was to save a tech-priest from a collonised planet infested by Tyranids (basically aliens from the Aliens franchise) before their hiveships made it to the planet.

The cast is:
Assault Marine (me, melee fighter)
Tactical Marine (gun marine)
Psyker Marine (magic user)

We found the Tech-Priest without too many problems. The Psyker Marine killed a horde of Tyranids while Tactical Marine and me brought the Tech-Priest back, and Tactical Marine killed two Tyranid Warriors by himself. We fought our way up a tower against hordes of Tyranids with Bolters, Grenades and Chainswords. It was going great... Until we got to the top of the tower to wait for our extraction.

The roof of the tower explodes to a milion pieces as a Hive Tyrant erupts from the floor under us. A Hive Tyrant is basically like an Alien Queen, but much more nasty. We fought against it, using all of our strongest abilities from the stsrt to even hope to survive. But it lived. In the next two rounds, it ripped of the arm of the Tactical Marine and almost killed the Psyker Marine. Then the Psyker Marine unleashed all the power of the Warp while the Tactical Marine shot Hellfire rounds at the Hive Tyrant, dealing incredible amounts of damage.

But in unleashing the Warp, the Psyker Marine started a storm, and the storm rained blood down on the top of the tower. Then the Hyve Tyrant attacked me, but I managed to parry it with my Chainsword. At this point, the only thing I could do was to try to charge the beast and roll really high to have any hope to damage it. I do so. I hit.

Righteous Fury. This game version of a critical hit. If you manage to roll max damage, you can roll damage again, and add it to the damage of the attack, which ignores armor. So I roll damage for the basic attack, then for the Righteous Fury... Righteous Fury again. Roll damage... RIGHTEOUS FUCKING FURY. I ended up rolling damage 4 times against the Hive Tyrant, and, thank the Emperor, it was enough to kill it.

Now the GM narrates how I manage to block the strike from the huge claw and chop off the arm of the beast. He narrates as I plunge the Chainsword inside the Hive Tyrant’s abdomen, tearing blood, sinew and gore out of it’s body. He narrates how I activate my Jump Pack, and as the thrusters roar with flames, I charge forward, pushing the Hive Tyrant back to the edge of the tower. He narrates how the Hive Tyrant screams as I rip out my Chainsword out from its guts, and kick him off of the tower. And he narrates how the Hive Tyrant falls down the tower, screaming, and how he crashes down on the ground, as my Battle Brothers and I watch from the top of the tower, being rained down upon by a rain of blood.

We manage to hold off the rest of the Horde while we wait for our extraction to come, and we manage to get in and leave. Our mission accomplished.

This was, the most metal, brutal, and epic RPG session I have ever played.",rpg,1571634083.0,0,3125,573
519,901,9gecxc,"I couldn't find the perfect world-building tool for me, so I made one! Introducing LegendKeeper!","Ever since I became a DM for my DnD group a few years back, I've always thought that managing the rich details of a world was a little overwhelming. I looked for software tools to help me in my quest to become a better DM and worldbuilder, but I couldn't find anything I was really happy with. As a personal project, I started developing LegendKeeper, a tool for world-builders and game masters to create and manage content for their worlds. I wanted a tool that offered both powerful creation features, that also made my information easy to access.

LK allows you to upload, annotate, and nest absolutely massive maps; create articles about the people, places, and things in your world with rich text editing; link map locations to those articles; and full-text search your world's encyclopedia from anywhere in the app. I'm currently working on on-the-fly procedural generation, and content sharing, for when you're needing some inspiration, and a bunch of other cool stuff I won't reveal quite yet. :D

Or, is there a way to automatically block self-promo and crowdfunding?","Logging on and seeing 6/10 of the newest posts being shills is just excessive. You can't even go on r/indierpg anymore. It's nothing but ads. I mean, I'm not trying to get in the way of someone's hustle, but when you literally see more shills than content, it's just too much. Not to mention, most shills only contribute when they are shilling. There's already a specifically RPG promo sub somewhere. Is there a place for RPGs where it's just RPG talk? Or, can I filter out posts by flair? Thanks!

Edit: this has been amusing. I wasn't suggesting that shills be banned. I was just looking for a better way to screen them out to improve my own ux. It only goes to show how the shills dominate the sub when such a question gets so heavily downvoted.

521,908,ly8aa6,"The Term ""Roleplay Heavy"" Sucks, and You Probably Mean ""Social Interaction Heavy""","I wrote a blog post called [The Exclusion of Combat from ""Roleplaying""](https://austin-tinkel.com/the-exclusion-of-combat-from-roleplaying/) in which I discussed the use of the term ""roleplay heavy"" in game advertisements on sites like Roll20 and /r/lfg.

In summary, I notice that a lot of people describe their (especially D&D) games as ""roleplay heavy"" when they actually mean ""social interaction heavy"". This has led to a lot of frustration for me that so many people don't consider combat as part of roleplaying.

I personally hate game sessions that involve just sitting around talking in character for 3 hours. I would much rather have swashbuckling action and high stakes danger than a slower, more personal game. However, the current popular definition of roleplay would imply that action-oriented games are lacking in roleplay, to which I very much disagree.

I think a better way to describe game style is with genre descriptions and specific examples from popular media.

What do you think? Am I just an old man yelling at a cloud about meaningless semantics or do others share this frustration?

Edit: Okay, it seems like my clickbait-y title is giving off the wrong impression here. What I really just want is more clear descriptions of what kind of game the GM is going to run. I don't like having to leave games because I get bored, I would rather know up front what kind of game it is so I don't waste anyone's time. I think there are better words and terms for the types of games people play. In my experience, things like ""roleplay heavy"" just don't convey enough information to make an informed decision and lead to more questions than answers about the particulars of the game experience. I think genre descriptions and media examples go a long way in rectifying this. I'm not trying gatekeep what actually counts as ""roleplay"" or anything like that.",rpg,1614936517.0,0,1871,311

523,910,ilx5hn,A List of RPG’s I’d Recommend Everyone to Check Out Once,"I don’t know if I used be proper flair, but couldn’t find a better one to use. Anyways, I made a list on a separate sub to recommend to someone and thought I’d share here. Hope you enjoy!

- The obligatory **DnD** and **Pathfinder**, although I’d note that DnD 4e and 5e are VERY different and so I’d recommend looking into both. Pathfinder also just released a new edition, but both play fairly similarly. If you’re looking for vast character creation options though then Pathfinder 1e is the way to go, an “Arcade-like” or a gaming RPG-like experience would best represent DnD 4e (in terms of powers and gameplay), and then DnD 5e has become a classic yet Pathfinder 2e is seemingly more optimized. 
- **Monster Hearts (1 & 2)** is a Fueled/Powered by the Apocalypse game *(meaning it uses the Apocalypse World engine)*. Very heavily based off of Buffy, this game is about being a teenager (or young adult, your choice) coming to grips with growing up, maybe dealing with hormones, and also dealing with the fact you’re a *literal* monster. Be the territorial Werewolf on the football team, the hive-minded Queen who runs the school, maybe the punk-rock Witch plotting their revenge, or even the love-stuck Mortal who can’t help but be drawn to the dark. *(This game is actually made by Avery Alder, a queer woman who heavily involves LGBTQ themes in most of her work).*
- **The Quiet Year** (also made by Alder, check out Buried Without Ceremony for all of her games) is a game about rebuilding after an apocalypse. Using only a deck of cards, a map, some coloring tools. and your own creativity you’ll watch your settlement grow and develop projects while exploring the devastated area, meanwhile preparing for the Winter ahead when the Harbingers appear. Very open-ended and a variety of levels of play available.
- **Monster of the Week** is heavily reminiscent of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Supernatural, and even in a way Stranger Things. Similar to Monster Hearts, but superior in it’s own ways. This isn’t so much about being the monster as it is *SLAYING* the monster. A great alternative to Monsterhearts if you want to love away from the highschool hormones. 
- The **World/Chronicles of Darkness** games are set in a dark and gritty supernatural world that resembles our own. There is a core book set but also tons of focuses with Vampires, Werewolves, Mages, Giests *(like OP Mediums)*, Changelings *(people taken and warped by the Fae)*, and more. A game about what it means to be human, and what you do when you’re not... *(Note: Older books are under “World of Darkness” and newer ones are under “Chronicles of Darkness”. Feel free to look more into why that is.)*
- **Legacy: Among the Ruins** is a multi-generational game about a struggling society, where you’ll not only control one large family or world-faction but also individual characters of said faction over time as different key players emerge within your campaign’s timeline.
- **Masks** is another game Fueled/Powered by the Apocalypse except this time you’re playing as a young and hopefully hero who has to manage their relationships, ensure their own survival, face the unique drawbacks of their powers, while also “doing the right thing”.
- **City of Mist** asks the question “What if you were secretly the embodiment of some famous figure, real or fake? Like... Arthur Pendragon? Alice in Wonderland? Or maybe even Robinson Crusoe?” and then immediately answers it. You live in a city where most, of not everyone, has forgotten their alternate selves, and where you are among the few who have shaken that fog from your mind and must balance regaining your past self while holding on to who you are now. 
- **Kult: Divinity Lost** takes supernatural horror to an entirely new level. This is a world of blood, darkness, madness, and worse. A game about humanity’s lost divinity and how reality is but a prison. Think Hellraiser, meets Lovecraft, meets the darkest fairy tales and darkest urban legends you’ve ever heard... and then make it worse. 
- **Apocalypse World** is the birthplace and origin of the Apocalypse Engine used in many games today (and many on this list too!) It streamlines the mechanical processes of the game making for faster gameplay, sacrifices no depth, and actually emphasizes the importance of your character’s experiences and relationships in many tangible ways. A great game with a great system to boot.
- **Dungeon World** is a game that skips all the deep mechanical complexity of games like DnD and Pathfinder and instead is Fueled/Powered by the Apocalypse. You make your adventurer, build up your relationships to your party, and dive on in to a world full of potential! 
- **Burning Wheel** is oddly reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings setting, and plays out in a system more complex than any other system I’ve described above. It’s core tenets revolving around a wheel and your character’s symbolic attachment to it. How your character has the core of the wheel, their attributes the spikes that turn, and the outer rim their manifestation upon the world. A great thought process to go through *(if you can get past the combat section!)*
- **FATE** is going to be the final contribution, it’s less of a game and more of an immensely open system for you to use to make nearly any sort of setting for a game you want. It has many books and modules, but it’s biggest asset is just how freeform and adaptable it is, yet still remaining balanced. Truly gets to that age-old idea of role playing games being the embodiment of “playing pretend as kids but actually playing fairly”.
- **Dream Askew** is another Avery Alder game that centers around an enclave of survivors holding out against the forces of a psychic wasteland. With gangs, beasts, and the psychic maelstrom hounding at your doors how will you be able to find love, peace, and hope amongst your fellow misfits?
- **Paranoia** is set in a dystopian sci-fi world where you are a Troublshooter in a futuristic city overseen by The Computer. Do your best to fit into The Computer’s “perfect society” while dealing with the constant threat of The Outdoors, the Communists, Mutants, Secret Societies *(especially... The Communists!)*, and be sure to NEVER disappoint The Computer! It resembles bleak dystopian novels such as 1984, Brave New World, and THX 1138 all the while keeping a tone of dark comedy and tongue-in-cheek humor.
- **Ten Candles** is a game set in a survival horror setting where survival just isn’t an option. A darkness has enveloped the sky, and the faint flickering of light is your only hope. This game is not suited for digital play, as you and your fellow doomed companions will develop your characters and literally burn away your “character sheet” over the course of your game, representing the sacrifices you’ll make just to die in the dark. A unique factor is that 10 candles are lit during the whole play time, and as each scene ends in misfortune a candle will be extinguished, and if your last candle goes out *(by you blowing it out or simply by burning down to the wick)* then it’s game over.
- **Dread** is another game best suited for actual table-top gameplay. Here you and your friends play as the main cast straight out of a horror film, with each move and decision you make being represented by the pull of a block from an ever increasingly unstable Jenga Tower... that’s right, the core mechanic here is a Jenga Tower. An innovative application on the stress inducing family classic, this game has a hard rule in it that if a character knocks over the tower while making their pull... *they’re dead.* 
- **Fiasco** seems to perfectly capture the whacky, zany, and interconnected nature so common in the greatest stories told time and time again. Choose a setting book, get out a BUNCH of D6’s, your index cards, and some pens/pencils because this is a game about acting! You’ll establish your characters traits/connections with an initial partially-random roll of the dice and by using the scene-specific tables provided. You’ll establish the exposition with your fellow cast mates, and then go on to act out scenes with your co-stars hoping to get what you want and to get it good! You’ll start each scene by either determine the outcome of the scene or establish what the scene is about while your fellow players choose the other option for you. Collect a pool of Black and/or White dice throughout the game, survive the TILT TABLE, make it through the climax and... well, you may get out with some of your limbs still attached? *(This game is truly best explained by watching TableTop’s episodes on this game.)*
- **Shadowrun** takes place in a potential future of our own reality where magic reawakens in the modern day, causing the resurgence of otherworldly entities, the use of Magic by mage and shaman alike, with some people transforming *(or “goblinizing”) into Elves, Dwarves, Trolls, and more all while featuring the oppressive forces of a future corporate world structure. Where a company and a government are synonymous to one another, and where the internet is more like “VR, but deadly” with programs that can fry your meat-self if you go hacking in the wrong areas. But here you’ll play as a Shadowrunner, a hired hand among the SINless, CEO’s, and worse. You’ll make enemies everywhere, and be allowed almost nowhere. *Welcome to the Shadow...* 
- **Call of Cthulhu** is LITERALLY a game all about Lovecraftian horror. You’ll have hours of fun watching as your character’s mind skips further into insanity, clinging to all kinds of harmful habits like sex, drugs, and self-destructive behavior before slowly snapping and killing everyone you loved... oh, and that’s a *good* outcome! You don’t even want to know what would happen if you got even a glimpse at Shub-Niggurath’s left pinkie toe! *(.... do abstract cosmic horrors comprised of tentacles even have pinkie toes???)*
- **Little Fears** sees you in the role of a small child being hunted by creatures who want to drag you into Closetland. But this isn’t some David Bowie musical fever dream! This is a world fueled on the eternal torment and fear of children warped and anguishing at the hands of the Seven Kong’s and their ruler, the Demagogue. The only thing that shields them from these horrors *(such as The Monster Under the Bed, Werewolves, Bogeymen, or even Baba Yaga)* is a special form of magic called Belief. And don’t think you can run and tell your parents, they can’t see Closetland anymore, and they can’t remember it either. And some day... neither will you.
- **Ex Novo** is a free print-and-play game (with pdf versions available literally right now) that facilitates the building of a city by drawing its components in a map. It can be played solo, and has just as much use for developing towns for your own settings as it is fun to play with.
- **Microscope** is a game all about making one big picture and then slowly zooming in more and more... what’s this picture of? It’s an image of an entire world and it’s history. You and a few players will start with a general concept and gradually expand it outwards, allowing you to have a world of whatever depth you like and that can be adjusted how you each see fit. What’s even better is that this fun game, beyond serving as a great exercise in creativity and cooperation, can even help you make your own settings for games, books, or whatever else have you!

***Lancer*** **imagines a future where a survivor humanity has spread to the stars** after weathering terrible ecological collapse on Earth - the end of the Anthropocene as a consequence of unrestrained consumption and poor stewardship. Five thousand years later, humanity lives in the wake of a desperate revolution, one where the victorious radicals now manage the galaxy they've won.    


The setting features a mix of gritty, mud-and-lasers military science fiction and mythic science fantasy, where  conscript pilots mix ranks with flying aces, mercenary guns-for-hire brawl with secretive corpro-state agents, and relativistic paladins cross thermal lances with causality-breaking, unknowable beings. *Lancer*'s galaxy is one where utopia exists, but is under threat, and the struggle is not yet entirely won; the revolution is not yet done. 

In *Lancer,* players adopt the roles of mechanized chassis pilots - mech pilots - comrades together in a galaxy of danger and hope. Some groups will fight to rectify the crimes of previous administrations; others will fight for their nation,  pieces in a greater game of hegemony. Others will carry the banner of a corpro-state or mercenary company, working to advance private interests while lining their pockets. Others still will fight for groups acting in opposition to those in power - for the underground, for the forgotten, agents of entropy and agents of yet more radical revolutions. 

*Lancer* offers deep, modular mech customization, a wide range of player backgrounds and hooks to prompt storytelling, and a system and setting with room for any narrative you and your group want to tell. It’s best with a group of 3-5 players, and can be used to run a one-shot session or persistent campaign. ",rpg,1575060937.0,0,2267,335
528,922,bn0g4a,Rewrite of Dogs in the Vineyard,"Basically every time anyone in this subreddit asks what rpg to use for a particular game, my suggestion is a hack of **Dogs in the Vineyard**, because it's my favorite system. Years ago, some friends and I used a hack of it to run a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure game, and since then I've used the system to run dozens of games in various copyrighted universes, as well as things of my own creation.

At Gen Con every year I run a new one-shot using my hack, and last year several people asked me if my setting was published. And considering I spent several months writing it, I figured I should look into doing that. So I emailed the guy (Vincent Baker, of Apocalypse World fame) who wrote the game originally, asking for permission to publish my campaign as long as I include a link to purchase DitV. 

He responded more or less immediately, with bad news. Unfortunately, DitV is out of print so I could not do that. However, he told me that the only thing copyrighted are his actual words, and what I *should* do is rewrite the whole thing and publish it as my own.

531,927,tc4d1w,"If you're a player and you're having fun, tell your GM!","I'm a new GM to a party of 4 friends, of which 3 are new players. I've been wanting to play some TTRPG with my friends for literally ages, but it never worked out. I've studied multiple systems but never got to play anything. 

Recently, one of my friends started watching some streams by this famous Brazilian streamer who has his own horror investigation TTRPG system. I saw this as an opportunity to convince her to play something with me and another friend who's a veteran to play with us. We eventually got another 2 friends to join us. They have no idea of what's RPGs actually are, but they both love literature, storytelling, and acting, so I thought they'd be a good fit. I decided City of Mist would be the best game for the party even though it's not one I'm particularly familiar with.

So now I have a player who has only watched professional streams and therefore has expectations, two who have no idea of what they're getting into, and one who has ONLY played D&D before. As a completely new DM, I'm absolutely terrified about running this table, and as an anxious overthinker, it's hard not to think that I'm going to mess up, and they will never want to play again. 

A few minutes ago, the player who watches streams sent me an audio message of her saying she's really excited for the game to start, a picture of a pile of post-its with character ideas and a pinterest link with a bunch of references to her character's appearance. You may call me a crybaby, but that almost made me cry. This is something I've wanted for so long and was terrified I wouldn't be able to play again because players gave up (which has happened the other two times I tried to set up a table).

532,929,14eukg9,I dislike ignoring HP,"I've seen this growing trend (particularly in the D&D community) of GMs ignoring hit points. That is, they don't track an enemy's hit points, they simply kill them 'when it makes sense'.


I never liked this from the moment I heard it (as both a GM and player). It leads to two main questions:


1. Do the PCs always win? You decide when the enemy dies, so do they just always die before they can kill off a PC? If so, combat just kinda becomes pointless to me, as well as a great many players who have experienced this exact thing. You have hit points and, in *some* systems, even resurrection. So why bother reducing that health pool if it's never going to reach 0? Or if it'll reach 0 and just bump back up to 100% a few minutes later?


2. Would you just kill off a PC if it 'makes sense'? This, to me, falls **very** hard into railroading. If you aren't tracking hit points, you could just keep the enemy fighting until a PC is killed, all to show how strong BBEG is. It becomes less about friends all telling a story together, with the GM adapting to the crazy ides, successes and failures of the players and more about the GM curating their own narrative.",rpg,1687313772.0,0,1162,219
533,931,k319wt,D&D 45th Anniversary Sapphire Dice Set: manufacturing defects and poor returns,"If this isn't allowed here, please delete. So, for a recent anniversary, my wife wanted to surprise me with a set of these (normally these would be way too pricey, but we had a sudden windfall and my wife wanted to get me something I'd never spring for normally,). Unfortunately, we've been greatly dissatisfied with both the product and the response from Wizards, to the point where I would not recommend anyone buy these dice or do business directly with Wizards:


The dice themselves arrived four days after ordering even with regular shipping, which was great. The set itself was not - almost every die had a sever cosmetic flaw or manufacturing defect (tool-marks/scoring on the metal that did not buff off with optical cloth, etc per their care instructions for grease or fingerprints, or thin/unpainted spots on many of the ampersand-faces). I've posted a few examples here:


https://imgur.com/gallery/wzxOUNg


Trying to get these replaced by Wizards has been like pulling teeth - it would have been faster and easier to demand a refund and order a whole new set. After several emails back and forth with customer service, I got a shipping label for my return and sent them back. I got email notification  that my dice had been received and a new set would be shipped soon and then... nothing. After weeks of waiting and getting no notice or shipping information, I emailed asking for an ETA or info on what was going on, but kept getting cursory responses that I would get shipping information when my replacements were sent. After more than a month, I requested escalation of my issue to a manger (which had to be made twice before I could get a reply)and got the following boilerplate reply a few days after my final request:


""Unfortunately, at this time, we do not have any updates to provide regarding the shipping information for your replacement order. Our team is currently processing a significantly higher number of replacement requests that usual right now, and we are assisting customers in the order that requests were received. Do note that, as soon as your replacement order has been processed and shipped, you will receive an automatic email with tracking information for your replacement"".

*EDIT - I just got a message from Mike Mearls inquiring after this issue. He's indicated he'll be looking into it personally himself when people are in the office Monday. I definitely didn't expect contact from WotC to come from these posts, and I definitely appreciate that this was made visible enough for them to do so. I'll update when I hear more
Further attempts at requesting more information, explanations or escalation have been ignored so far.


As of 11/28/20, I am still without a product I purchased in August or any idea of when I will get a new set (and with some dread a new set will be just as flawed/damaged, putting me back in this same cycle). I understand the current situation means shipping and response times may be slowed in every industry, but this ammout of delay in turnaround (while the company still has my money), without being able to provide estimated fulfillment dates  or even an idea of where a request is in the queue... it's appallingly poor customer service to say the least, especially when Wizards seems to be having no issue fulfilling other orders (new books and the like seem to be shipping out at a normal pace, despite Covid). As Wizards refuses to be forthcoming with anything further, I'm forced to spread my experience to every public forum possible and warn others away from buying these while I look into other avenues of complaint (eg, with Hasbro).",rpg,1606617213.0,0,3621,618

**The core combat mechanics**: Spells always hit but the damage is rolled.Weapons roll 10+ to hit, but always deal a flat amount of damage. And players roll to dodge instead of enemies rolling to hit. There are no modifiers which means we're doing about 1/4 of the computations per action.

It immediately struck me as the missing link between our Roll20 maps and our Discord chat server.

&#x200B;

Here are a few highlights:

* It organizes everything into categories that are as detailed as you need them. Want a generic location? Ok, that works. Want a location with a profile pic, map, parent location, associated relations and calendars, notes, and more? Ok, that works too. Organizations, families, quests, items; these are some more examples of categories each with their own details and options.
* Everything is interconnected with tags if you choose to use them. Visited a town two years ago that you can't remember much about? That's cool, just select the town's tag and you'll see everything in a nice little list. Even better? You can nest tags within tags, so looking up the town's region will also show the town's stuff.
* You can assign different roles to users. Want to set it up so players are able to edit the item lists but not see stuff you've marked private (like the note stating which NPC is the actual BBEG)? Done, in like 20 seconds. You can make the game public too, so users can view the stuff without logging in as long as they have the link (good for paranoid players using public computers).
* Speaking of paranoia, you can export pretty much everything as a PDF so you've got a backup of your hard work saved in case something apocalyptic happens that's strong enough to kill the Internet but not strong enough to snuff your desire for raiding Lich King tombs.
* It's FREE. As in no purchase price, no monthly subscription, and no ads. There is a Patreon that unlocks larger image uploads for $1 a month, but that's not required since you can still upload smaller images with a 2mb max file size.

547,955,twxwqw,WotC has an incredible opportunity right now to do a last-hurrah re-release of 4th edition.,"**The lead, lest I not bury it:** Compile and re-release 4th edition Essentials, errata, and fixes from books like DMG2 and MM3 as one big book, ""D&D Tactics"". Make it clear that it is 4e compatible, usable with 4e campaign setting books, and is targeted at people who want crunchier mechanics and combat than 5e.

# Why

D&D 4e was an extremely cool product that stumbled out of the gate. It was D&D with tactical skirmish wargame combat, and could have been a hit. WotC made two fatal mistakes with its release:

1. They did not make it clear exactly what it was. Players expected a loose system, instead they got a tight one. WotC did not control the branding or message, so players took over. The narrative became that it was an MMO in tabletop form.
2. It was not well-balanced in the core rulebook. Combats were a slog and new additions like skill challenges made little sense as written. Items were plentiful and weak. It didn't quite land as was intended by the designers.

These were corrected quite a bit late in the game. Essentials released as somewhat of a ""4.5e"" errata and rebalancing, alongside lots of ""2"" and ""3"" core rulebooks, all too late and split between too many products.

Only now, many years later, D&D players who have dipped their toes in wargaming have finally come to realize what the designers at WotC were intending. Especially now that 5e is so light on crunch that alternative RPG systems are experiencing a renaissance from tabletop diehards, even as 5e reaches its mainstream peak.

The disadvantage to this late-blooming realization is that players who wish to pursue 4e inevitably encounter the fact that they need several extra books to play 4e ""the way it was meant to be played"". A stack of 6 books on the table isn't an appealing prospect.

# How

Compile everything that might be considered ""4.5e"" together. The core classes, a few of the best alternate classes from PHB2/3, cleaned up mechanics, balanced monsters, and the highest-quality alternate rules and tweaks such as DMG2/Dark Sun ""Fixed Enhancement Bonus"".

Release it all as a single book. Alternative systems are well-known for publishing PC creation, DM rules, and enemy lists into a single hardcover book. This is a great opportunity for WotC to give this a try with D&D.

They must make it *very clear* what this product is. Call it ""D&D Tactics"" because it's D&D with tactical combat and balanced class kits. Also make it clear that it is fully 4e compatible, and players can pull out their old campaign setting books. The ""Tactics"" label also makes it clear that it is a ""spin-off"" product that does not take attention away from 5e product lines, and does not need to be considered by 5e players. But it *must* be made clear that it is *not* 5e-compatible. This probably means using the 4e D&D logo and the 4e art and cover styling, so there's no confusion. Stay away from 5e cover styling.

---

And yeah, that's all. I want to see 4e given a fair shake. It was a cool system, I want to play it again without a stack of errata on the table, so it needs some love. A lot of people are waking up to the fact that it was top notch when pursued correctly. Take advantage of that demand.",rpg,1649173487.0,0,3193,567
548,957,9oi757,"I DM'd a game where combat was 100% arena based, and it was liberating.","As a DM, I have always had trouble with getting combat 'right.' I seem to alternate between combats that are too easy and a bit boring, or murderous near TPK's with no in-between. 

Recently i started a game that completely switched the emphasis. Instead of adventuring around normally, the players were part of a mercenary group who slay monsters in an arena for entertainment (I got the idea from a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35052265-bloody-rose)).

Suddenly, It didn't matter in the slightest if the combat was too easy. Sure the players could go slaughter a bunch of goblins without breaking a sweat, but that isn't going to get the crowd going. When the 'point' of combat shifted away from loot-nabbing and survival and into entertaining a crowd,  players started thinking of cool ways to approach the battle and interesting combinatorial use of spells and abilities. They did all the things I'd been trying to encourage them to do since *forever* without the slightest prompting. 

And I felt a lot of pressure to get combat 'right' lift from me as a DM -- it didn't matter if things were a bit easy because the players still had to impress the crowd, and everyone had a lot of fun figuring out cool/awesome ways to do that, and i found myself having a lot more fun with it too. 

Obviously this approach doesn't work for all campaigns/scenarios, but I'd highly recommend throwing some arena combat against your players. Just make sure the condition for victory isn't necessarily just winning the fight, but impressing judges. In my tournament, several teams take turns fighting monsters and are given a score based on how well they do, with bonus points for flashiness. 

On their own, players decided they wanted to try sabotage the other teams by drugging the monsters they were going to fight so they couldn't fight back. It's hard to give a flashy performance when the ogre is asleep. 

It's been a really fun, if weird, campaign so far and I just wanted to bring it up -- because hey, you might have some fun with it, too and it's been a good antidote to something I've always struggled with as a DM - getting combat *just so*.",rpg,1539647146.0,0,2156,370

You don't need to stay in a game that isn't fun. If you tried to advocate for yourself and nothing is changing it may be time to leave.

You don’t need to do that. If you’re playing in a game with other players or a GM that are stopping you from having fun there is no reason to stay. You know what is fun for you.

Fear is a big reason a lot of players stay with games that aren’t fun anymore. They may be afraid they’ll hurt someone’s feelings if they leave. Or they may be afraid they won’t find another game. 

That makes sense. If you find a game after looking for a long time it can be a tough thing to walk away. RPGs scratch a lot of itches for people, and it can be scary to leave a group if you don’t know who your next GM will be. 

I've chosen to return to a bad game before because I had that fear. I didn’t think I’d be able to find another game.

**2. But I like playing with my friends**

There's something singularly special about spending time with other people, carving out a shared story and experience. Solo play is not a like-for-like replacement, it is its own thing. Crucially the two ways of playing are not mutually exclusive. You can enjoy both.

**3. Where would I start?**

Now there's a question! Let me walk you over to the club's recommendation board...

Games that are often peoples' first solo experience:

* [**Thousand Year Old Vampire**](https://thousandyearoldvampire.com/) \- a simple, intuitive, beautiful game about chronicling the many centuries of a vampire's existence (this [illustrated playthrough on twitter](https://twitter.com/olddoggames/status/1377786943962902529) will make you want to play)
* [**Ironsworn**](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/) \- a robust, quest-driven FREE game about undertaking perilous quests in a dark fantasy setting (the [Me, Myself and Die series on YouTube with Trevor Devall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVxJ3exjfgI) perfectly captures the agony and ecstasy of playing solo)
* [**Four Against Darkness**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/180588/Four-Against-Darkness) \- a dungeon-delving, dice-chucking procedural game that straddles the line between board game and roleplaying game

Games that are slightly off the beaten track:

* [**The Machine**](https://adira.itch.io/the-machine) \- a serial, journalling game about a cursed machine, involving filling out a notebook and passing it on to the next player
* [**Alone Among The Stars**](https://noroadhome.itch.io/alone-among-the-stars) \- a simple game about exploring space and experiencing wondrous sights
* [**The Wretched**](https://loottheroom.itch.io/wretched) \- a sci-fi horror journalling game about being the sole remaining crew member on a salvage ship, trying to survive. Cleverly makes use of a Jenga tower to represent the ship's ailing structural integrity
* [**The Portal at Hill House**](https://presspotgames.itch.io/the-portal-at-hill-house) \- a cosmic horror game using dice and playing cards about navigating a cursed house

*There are so many to mention, so I will add a separate comment below with some others!*

The non-solo games that you already know and love:

* **Call of Cthulhu** \- Chaosium publish a series of solo gamebooks for CoC, e.g. the introductory solitaire adventure [**Alone Against the Flames**](https://www.chaosium.com/alone-against-the-flames/)
* **Mörk Borg** \- [**Sölitary Defilement**](https://1d105.itch.io/solitary-defilement) is a supplement for the main game that introduces ""comprehensive rules for exploring the dying lands solitary""
* **Mausritter** \- [**Einzelmaus**](https://manarampmatt.itch.io/einzelmaus-solo-mausritter) is another solo tool you can bolt onto the core game to allow solo play
* **DnD** \- believe it or not you can play DnD single-player using a variety of tools. One of the most commonly used is called the [**Mythic Games Master Emulator (Mythic GME)**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20798/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator). This a universal tool that helps replace the traditional GM role. Which brings me onto...

**4. What are things I should know?**

Some games are made for solo, some games are made for group but can be adapted for solo. In the latter case, often you can get by with what's called an *oracle*.

It's easy enough to answer yes/no questions with dice rolls or coin flips, but when you have an open question, like ""what do I see in this room?"", that's where an oracle comes in. Essentially it's a random table that will steer you in an unexpected, but not entirely untenable direction. Mythic GME, which I mentioned above, is just one example of a comprehensive tool along these lines (others are available). Using something like this, suddenly a lot of the games on your shelf are opened up to solo play.

r/Solo_Roleplaying is a friendly community that can help you out with suggestions or if you're stuck. In their About section there are a load of great resources for getting started.

Let me take this moment to formally welcome you to the club. **If you have questions about playing solo, leave a comment** and hopefully the more experienced soloers can give you a hand.

**If you're already part of the solo club, leave a comment and tell us about your favourite experience playing solitaire.**",rpg,1668079536.0,0,5724,871

558,969,1d8325h,Learning RPGs really isn’t that hard,"I know I’m preaching to the choir here, but whenever I look at other communities I always see this sentiment “Modifying D&D is easier than learning a new game,” but like that’s bullshit?? Games like Blades in the Dark, Powered by the Apocalypse, Dungeon World, ect. Are designed to be easy to learn and fun to play. Modifying D&D to be like those games is a monumental effort when you can learn them in like 30 mins. I was genuinely confused when I learned BitD cause it was so easy, I actually thought “wait that’s it?” Cause PF and D&D had ruined my brain. 

It’s even worse for other crunch games, turning D&D into PF is way harder than learning PF, trust me I’ve done both. I’m floored by the idea that someone could turn D&D into a mecha game and that it would be easier than learning Lancer or even fucking Cthulhu tech for that matter (and Cthulhu tech is a fucking hard system). The worse example is Shadowrun, which is so steeped in nonsense mechanics that even trying to motion at the setting without them is like an entirely different game.

I’m fine with people doing what they love, and I think 5e is a good base to build stuff off of, I do it. But by no means is it easier, or more enjoyable than learning a new game. Learning games is fun and helps you as a designer grow. If you’re scared of other systems, don’t just lie and say it’s easier to bend D&D into a pretzel, cause it’s not.

559,970,1czm1a2,Unpopular Opinion: ANY Miniature Will Work,"I work part-time at my FLGS and I (Me) had a very usual interaction with a customer (C) the other night.

C: Do you have any other centaur miniatures? The Nolzur's one is too buff.

Me: {thinking she was going for a dad-bod centaur, fantastic idea, be different!} Let me see what else we have in the system... okay, the only other centaurs we have are for the Kings of War games by Mantic. {walk her over to wargames aisle} Here... and here.

C: Oh, they have horns, my character doesn't have horns. {proceeds to do the thing every FLGS employee dreads, tell me about her character's 15 page backstory}

Me: {nodding and smiling while the elevator Muzak plays between my ears} Okay, that sounds interesting! But I'm sorry, these are what we have. 

C: {thinking it will help} Here, I built him in Hero Forge, this is what he looks like. {proceeds to show me fairly generic centaur fighter character, that looks just as buff as the Nolzur's one we have on a peg, no dad-bod to be seen}

Brief interlude, because my brain is screaming at this point - even if you don't have your own 3d printer, you can create a character to your specifications in Hero Forge and pay them to print it for you. Even if you can't afford the $20 for the cheapest, unpainted, ""not premium"" plastic, for a mere $13, they'll make you a colored plastic standee that looks pretty good and is easier to store and transport. 

Me: You know they will print those for you and sell them to you, right?

C: Oh yeah, but that's too expensive.

Me: {more grinning and nodding and gritting of teeth}

Look folks, we all want to put a miniature out onto the table that looks EXACTLY like how we picture our PCs look like in our heads, but it's not going to happen. Unless you go to the trouble of rebuilding them in Hero Forge every time they have a change of gear and pay for the expense of reprinting them, which most of us can't afford or be bothered to do. Which now begs the question of what you're doing with the old mini when you've replaced it, but that's a different conversation. So what miniature will work for us? The miniature that you can afford, whether it's a generic Nolzur's/Bones/Deep Cuts plastic, or a wargame metal/resin, or a plastic standee, or even a paper tent mini you've downloaded from the internet and printed on your employer's color printer when no one was looking, as long as you can recognize it from across the table and differentiate it from all the other miniatures on the table. That's it. This isn't tournament level WH40K where everything has to be WYSIWYG, close enough is all we're looking for. And if you can't afford the string of self or professionally printed Hero Forge or similar minis, ""good enough"" will just have to work for you.

Sorry folks, rant over. What are your experiences with miniatures at the table? And yes, I struggle with this in games other than D&D, any system that allows use of miniatures has seen this issue come up at one time or another. ",rpg,1716560804.0,0,2973,541
560,971,10rztmf,"The OSR, Lonely Fun, and why I believe many D&D alternatives entirely miss the point of why people will never leave 5th Edition","After \~recent events\~ it's an exciting time to evangelize new games for your table, especially if you want to get your D&D 5e group to try out some great new stuff. But looking at some of the discourse, I think when we talk about what makes certain TTRPGs appealing, we need to have a more sober look at why many of our friends, loved ones, and favorite fellow D&D addicts play the game.

For many, maybe even *most* D&D players, one of the essential, load-bearing pillars of the hobby to them has nothing to do with how the game plays, but rather, the **Lonely Fun**.

# Lonely Fun

The Lonely Fun is all of the stuff you do as a part of your hobby away from the table, in any way you might engage. For D&D 5e players, this is usually building complicated and elaborate characters on the page, pouring over the books for new races and subclasses, figuring out fun new combinations, and carefully crafting characters. It's also watching the livestreams and YouTube, shopping for accessories that will match a particular character, checking in on hobby news sources in order to anticipate upcoming releases. When WotC/Hasbro says it wants D&D to be a ""lifestyle brand"" it is exactly this pre-existing behavior that they are talking about -- they get made fun of for this, but they are really just observing something that is already happening. (It's worth noting that the recent D&D renaissance was sparked by a livestream that doesn't just get you interested in playing but, possibly more vitally, gives you hundreds and hundreds of hours of content to watch.)

Many of the things that are described as ""problems"" of D&D, like its lack of balance, its arcane subsystems, the things it attempts to simulate or not, actually *support* Lonely Fun the same way that video game metas support e-sports. Ever-changing balances around character builds, power creep in new releases -- these things are ***toyetic***. They give you something to play with in your free time when you wanna get away from work or school. They give you something to chat with other players about.

Yes, of course these players like playing at the table, but a huge part of the play experience is that it's an opportunity to try out all of the stuff they imagine and think about all week. The social experience *justifies and supports* the Lonely Fun. We can imagine that many people who didn't have an actual game group could still engage with D&D regularly -- this basically *was* the business model for 3rd Edition, and the reason that every 3rd party product needs to be chock full of player options even when it doesn't make any initial sense.

# Solutions for GMs that just create vacuums for players

Though most people might nod their heads at everything before, I think this is tough to *deeply* sympathize for forever DMs and GMs, and those of us who build worlds and run games, because when it comes to D&D alternatives and OSR games, *our* Lonely Fun remains untouched. If I want to run Mausritter, I could still spend my week paging through 3rd party supplements, randomly generating my hexes, preparing my sessions, and chatting with other DMs about it. But if my players switched over from Mausritter, a game where you can generate a full character in literally two minutes, what are they going to do between sessions? Re-watch The Secret of NIMH every week? I'm running more Call of Cthulhu each week, and even there we have similar issues.

For this reason, other RPGs, and particularly OSR games, are incredibly ill-suited to hobbyist players. Even D&D's biggest competitors have vastly fewer Lonely Fun opportunities.

All of this is key to keep in mind when debates rage about why people can't get players to stick, and the odd conspiracy theories about what happens in the industry or in the community in order to lock people into 5e. So many people advertise elegant rules sets, better tools for smoother sessions, simpler character creation, and better at-the-table play experiences, but these are often things that solve problems for GMs, not players. For *players*, overhearing them complaining about certain imbalances is akin to a sports fan complaining about their favorite players getting drafted to another team, because the opportunity to gab on a barstool and demonstrate niche knowledge is *why* they're a sports fan. \[EDIT: in other words, the complaint isn't a bug that needs solving, it is the fun that they're there for, it's the point.\]

But there's a better analogy here to work with...

# Wargaming has the same ""problem""

To use an analogy, there's a parallel problem in tabletop wargaming hobby, where the dominant player is Games Workshop and Warhammer 40,000, specifically, a game with punishingly expensive models and rulebooks, a draconian ruleset with a meta focused on monotonous competitive play, lore so arcane you could never hope to learn it all, and a community with a persistent Nazi incel problem. It's a money pit and a time sink so profound that many of you are probably having PTSD flashbacks just being reminded of your times painting or playing.

And for decades, there's been a vanguard of wargamers saying ""Stop giving them your money! There are better games with cheaper models, even minis-agnostic games! Play Frostgrave, it's so fun! Play OnePageRules! Why won't you all exit the vampire's castle of Games Workshop!? Wake up sheeple!!!"" But what they fail to realize is that for many, the above problems or bugs in the Warhammer 40,000 hobby are its *actual* biggest features. For a certain kind of person (let's say, for example, an escapist who is also a problem spender), the fact that it's a hobby that will eat all of your spare time, attention, and money is *exactly what they like about it*. In the same way that certain former drug addicts describe scoring dope each day as being a daily mission that gave them an immediate sense of urgency or purpose, the 40K hobbyist checks for the new limited-release Warbands and command boxes filled with plastic crack from Games Workshop, new YouTube meta videos and battle reports, the latest 4-hour lore video to put on in the background while painting. To make cheap models and simple rules is to *take the core experience out of the hobby*.

((Before I close here, I have to say to you, the guy about to comment ""Well that's not what MY players are like,"" that no, I do not believe this applies to every single player or table. In fact, the more likely your players are beer&pretzels types who think of TTRPGs only while they're at the table, and identify with it less as a hobby and more as just what-they-do-when-they-hang-out, the more foreign the Lonely Fun aspects will seem to them.))

Evangelizing certain TTRPGs requires this kind of recognition about D&D players. Many of them -- maybe a VAST swathe -- don't want a procedurally generated world, they don't want ""player skill,"" they have no interest in a character generation process that takes place at the table. They don't want a game where the ""answer is not on your character sheet,"" because the character sheet is the *primary item of interest* for their experience. The Lonely Fun is the point.

***tl;dr:*** It is possible that the TTRPG you want your players to get into might be much better for you as a GM, and might even lead to better sessions, but would ruin all of the fun that your D&D players are having *away* from the table out of your sight, and therefore will never meet their hobby-ing needs.

\[EDIT\] I want to clarify, I don't think this is ***the*** reason that D&D is so ubiquitous, or why it's The Big Game, but particularly why a certain type of player who is drawn to D&D 5e won't be drawn to other types of games, or at least why other types of games won't stick to them. I only add this because there are ppl in the comments going ""No, the reason D&D 5e is so popular is actually one reason, and it's very simple, and it's \[...\]"" but I'm not sure it's really constructive.",rpg,1675369429.0,0,7954,1377

___
Hi! Where to begin? 

For those of you unfamiliar with Hunter x Hunter's Greed Island, it's an mmo-like world that famous mangaka (HxH's author) Yoshihiro Togashi created for one of the serie's arcs, but what sets it apart is what I consider to be the highly novel card system he designed at its core, a system connected to every aspect of the game's world and inhabitants in a clever and satisfying way.

Part of what makes is special is that it's set up to allow for some really creative uses when it comes to its features— pretty much encouraging it by its very nature— and these features always have something valuable to contribute to every single one of the primary aspects of role playing games. And what's more is that it actually does this without it being an overly complex system at a surface level, which means it can be picked up with relative ease (in fact, slowly learning ""the system"" and to what extent it can be taken advantage of to achieve one's goals is an intended part of the in-game experience itself, something the PCs and potential rivals alike all have to go through).

But to be honest, I wouldn't be able to capture its true charm and mechanical novelty here with just a few words, so instead I urge you to just take a look at the PDF yourselves; check out the card system's mechanics, and especially the cards themselves— their artwork, their properties, to what extent can the players find unexpected things to do with them, etc.

As for the PDF itself, it gives you all the rules, details, and resources needed to run the game, and functions as a guide to craft your very own version of Greed Island for the type of setting you want to host or might already be hosting, so that it fits within the scope, lore, and aesthetics of the campaign. I made sure to add hyperlinks that take you to the different sections mentioned throughout it, so you can access each one pretty conveniently too.
Aside from the PDF, I also made tons of generators and charts to assist the GM in preparing the sort of content that is unique to a game like Greed Island, helping especially with the improv side of things. Ah, and I do intend to continue adding to those as I generate content for my very own Greed Island campaigns. All of that will always be accessible in the subreddit's wiki, along with the PDF and the character sheets.

So, those of you who are already familiar with Greed Island and have always wanted to experience it, your chance is finally here. And for those of you exploring it for the first time, I hope you come to enjoy the unique things it offers.

Thanks to all for checking it out. 😊",rpg,1593261447.0,0,2697,481
564,978,1g3ozcb,Does anyone else feel like rules-lite systems aren't actually easier. they just shift much more of the work onto the GM,"This is a thought I recently had when I jumped in for a friend as a GM for one of his games. It was a custom setting using fate accelerated as the system. 

I feel like keeping lore and rules straight is one thing. I only play with nice people who help me out when I make mistakes. However there is always a certain expectation on the GM to keep things fair. Things should be fun and creative, but shouldn't go completely off the rails. That's why there are rules. Having a rule for jumping and falling for example cuts down a lot of the work when having to decide if a character can jump over a chasm or plummet to their death. Ideally the players should have done their homework and know what their character is capable of and if they want to do something they should know the rules for that action.

Now even with my favorite systems there are moments when you have to make judgment calls as the GM. You have to decide if it is fun for the table if they can tunnel through the dungeon walls and circumvent your puzzles and encounters or not.

But, and I realize this might be a pretty unpopular opinion, I think in a lot of rules-lite systems just completely shift the responsibility of keeping the game fun in that sense onto the GM. Does this attack kill the enemies? Up to the GM. Does this PC die? Up to the GM. Does the party fail or succeed? Completely at the whims of the GM. 

And at first this kind of sounds like this is less work for both the players and the Gm both, because no one has to remember or look up any rules, but I feel like it kinda just piles more responsibility and work onto the GM. It kinda forces you into the role of fun police more often than not. And if you just let whatever happen then you inevitably end up in a situation where you have to improv everything. 

And like some improv is great. That’s what keeps roleplaying fun, but pulling fun encounters, characters and a plot out of your hat, that is only fun for so long and inevitably it ends up kinda exhausting.

I often hear that rules lite systems are more collaborative when it comes to storytelling, but so far both as the player and the GM I feel like this is less of the case. Sure the players have technically more input, but… If I have to describe it it just feels like the input is less filtered so there is more work on the GM to make something coherent out of it. When there are more rules it feels like the workload is divided more fairly across the table.

Do you understand what I mean, or do you have a different take on this? With how popular rules lite systems are on this sub, I kinda feel like I do something wrong with my groups. What do you think?

  
EDIT: Just to clarify I don't hate on rules-lite systems. I actually find many of them pretty great and creative. I'm just saying that they shift more of the workload onto the GM instead of spreading it out more evenly amonst the players.",rpg,1728935478.0,0,2904,556

569,985,1sj29d,"Sorry, I need to gush","So my co-worker and I were chatting about a month ago, turns out she and her four closest friends have been looking to get their D&D on for some time. Funny enough, I've been looking to DM again for even longer. I used to, many years ago, but I had big problems with my players getting 'bored' with their characters (ie: they saw the mage get a cool magic item, so they wanted to play a mage. And on...).

So I roll in that Sunday with my books in hand and they were kind enough to have character sheets and dice. Only problem is, just one of them has ever played D&D. One dude has never played an RPG before! I quickly steer that fellow away from the idea of playing a Druid or a Sorcerer (complex classes with a lot of restrictions and little short-term pay-off. Let's be honest, it's true), so I suggested fighter. Of course, he wanted to be a Dwarf. Excellent! He seemed a bit grumbly at the idea of being 'the tank' (oh how much they have to learn...), but I assured him he would have fun.

The rest of the group rolled up and seemed pretty happy with their characters. Human bard, elf ranger, dwarf wizard (who grew up with the fighter, parentless, in a 'dwarfanage'), and human cleric of St. Cuthbert. HORRAY! I managed to get a balanced party without people pulling knives on one another. I was almost salivating, ready to play.

First adventure they investigate a town where some kids have gone missing. Along they way they get attacked by a praying mantis the size of a draft horse. The dwarf fighter swoops in, saves the day, and takes it's head off like it was in mating season with a natural 20. Suddenly, the player is a lot less grumbly, he is over-the-top thrilled with his character. The party succeeds in killing goblins, an ettercap, and rescuing some of the villagers. They receive a few rewards, but the town is poor so they just promise to offer them cheap weapon and armor repair whenever they come to visit. Pays off in my world, as it's basically dark-age technology prices on everything (dwarves are in a state of isolationism, so no fancy metals!). They seem really enthusiastic about this, and feel quite attached to the tiny hamlet they helped save. Oh, be still my DM heart!

They go back to town, get another job. Turns out the local mages have had some books go missing from their library. They investigate, go down into the catacombs, and find a bugbear prowling around at night! But it's wearing robes and seems to be wearing cobbled together glasses... So instead of killing it, they knock it out, tie it up, and decide to question it. In quite a posh, scholarly tone, the bugbear explains how cross it is with the party! Turns out he is a previous chief librarian who was cursed, and just continues his research on the mating habits of Carrion Crawlers when nobody is around to bother him. Missing books? Why he's always returned the books he borrowed before morning. Uh oh, turns out the head librarian set this whole thing up to try and get the bugbear killed and get access to the Black Archive of the library (the bugbear had a key). Epic battle in the Black Archive follows, with the bugbear nearly killed by a summoned dire ape of fiendish quality. The party flips their shit. They really liked Bartholomew! No way he was gonna die on their watch. The cleric burns healing spells, taking some heavy hits for his trouble, but saves my NPC. The ranger manages to not be stunned by a spell and takes the no-good, villainous librarian in the eye with an arrow before he teleports away.

The emotional attachment my players are exhibiting to the world, their characters, AND the NPCs around them is like a breath of fresh air. They really care about the game, and the little rewards for them are just as good as the occasional magic item that falls into their hands. I have so many wonderful, horrible stories in mind for them as they level up. What makes it even more of an honour for me is that this is, for some of them, their first ever game of table top.

573,995,gp4yzl,Ever Wanted A Fully Functioning Village? I Made One For You.," Hey Guys,

Here is a handy campaign setting handout I made for my players, based around a Yorkshire Estate set in 800AD. However, this could easily be transferred into any fantasy setting.

[https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M7rRi-g8xLilmQNvHEH](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M7rRi-g8xLilmQNvHEH)

It was made for a RuneQuest campaign that I've been GMing for the last year and a half, and as such had an awful amount of stats and figures piling up that no one really wanted to interact with. As an example - ( 📷[https://gyazo.com/fa1ee998c8c56a439182bf1978d11ce8](https://gyazo.com/fa1ee998c8c56a439182bf1978d11ce8) ) - although this is the result of a couple of hours clean up. So I figured I needed to engage the players in the stake that they have, especially with about 6 months/ 1 year in game downtime approaching.

**Within the handout you can find:**

\- A brief history of the Estate.

\- An easy to understand description of the ruling system.

\- A layout of the key buildings both within the Manor and on the Outlying Hides (1 Hide = 120 Acres), and the nearby bandit village that has entered the service of the party (the Ealdormen).

\- A breakdown of the local economy (Income Vs Expenditure).

\- A breakdown of how the monetary system works (Pounds/Shillings/Pence) and some modern day equivalents.

576,998,egdfzs,Why it pays to be picky about the people you play with,"Video where I discuss the topic title [here.](https://youtu.be/D0bsVdWDFcg)

If you're like me, you enjoy RPG Horror Stories as a bit of a guilty pleasure. I'm an avid reader of /r/rpghorrorstories and have a few of my own. It's almost a rite of passage to have your sneak attack taken away by a neophyte GM who thinks they know more than the entire design team at Wizards, or to play with a player who conveniently forgot to tell the party that their pet dire wolf is somehow a multiclassed barbarian artificer. 

As much as I love these stories, there's something I see in a lot of these accounts that upsets me. The OP, after describing absolutely horrifying RPG sessions, then explains that they continued to play for another 5 or 10 sessions before quitting, or even worse, that they are *still playing* in the offending campaign. 

The above is a symptom of something I've noticed across our hobby: people playing with other people they don't especially like, or with people who actively disrespect them or their boundaries. For some reason, RPG fans are way too tolerant of jerks. Sometimes I'll hear a person describe the game they are playing in a tone dripping with either exasperation or derision, and I'll wonder: ""If you're so miserable, why the hell are you still playing?""

Roleplaying games are not like basketball. Let me explain: roleplaying games are experiences where one's personality is central to the experience (unless you're playing a game that is almost more board-game than traditional RPG). If someone is mean-spirited, condescending, or interesting in explored messed up impulses without consulting the boundaries of others -- that stuff *comes out in game* in a way that wouldn't be possible in other games like basketball. If I play a pick-up game with a jerk, yes, they can be a jerk in the game, but for the most part the mechanics of basketball (or most sports) don't give that person conduits to express that without violating the rules of the game. You can play with hundreds of strangers and get away with having mostly good times.

This is why folks should be incredibly picky with who they play games with or run games for. I'm not saying you shouldn't play with new folks -- in fact you can use RPGs to make new friends, it's an awesome hobby for that. But the operative idea is that you should be playing with friends or folks you would like to be friends with. If you're in a game with people you wouldn't like associating with in any other context, **that's a massive red flag.** Get out of there!

578,2,1f3scds,"B/X is so intuitive, I don't have to really ""prep"" anymore session to session.  ","To be clear, it was a lot of work before the game started.  I run Jacob Fleming's OSE modules with two groups on roll20, and before the first sessions I  uploaded all the maps (world, dungeon, and some wilderness encounters), as well as monster and npc tokens I would maybe need for several sessions. 

But now all I have to do is just roll encounters before a game.  It's all up to the players entirely on where to go and what to do.  I get to use my brain power during the session to run monsters during encounters and describe what's happening.  

No more laying down ""track"" of where players can go or trying to predict their movements.  Oh, you want to abandon the town under siege and go off into the mountains to go hunting?  Sure, you have the rations?  

No more fretting over balanced encounters.  Players  (mostly) approach the world and encounters with extreme caution because characters can actually die. I get to just enjoy listening to them strategize on what to do.  

No more DC nonsense. Roll under for an ability or over for a save.  Me and the players just decide when it's necessary, and often times it isnt unless its stated.  

Dungeon and wilderness exploration is guided by clear cut procedures. 

Combat procedures, in particular, ensure encounters are strategic and dramatic. No three hour slogs.  Characters die, but nothing ever seems unfair or contrived.  

No more thinking of mission hooks.  At first it was gold the players were after to level up, but over time the players, not me, built the story based on their actions.  Treasure is still a top priority, though.  

At the end of a session all I do is make a couple of notes on how the players actions may influence the world, record some of their ideas about what they think is happening and then, before next session roll up a few more encounters.  

I know this whole new dnd book is releasing this month, but I loathe the idea of having to go back and building the game while I'm driving it.  

After a year and half of play on my last 5e campaign I was totally burnt out and frustrated.  After a year and half of play on my OSE campaigns (plural) we are going strong and can't wait for the next session.

584,10,1fe9qcw,3D6 Down The Line & Arden Vulgaris in Arden Vul - Observations on playstyles,"Like many here, I'm a big fan of the [3D6 Down The Line podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@3D6DTL) (""3D6"" from now on). I've also recently stumbled over the [Arden Vulgaris podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@EricVulgaris/videos) (""AV"" from now on) which I greatly enjoy (but be warned that the production quality is lower). Since they are both running the *Arden Vul* megadungeon, I find it interesting to compare the styles and discuss. Note that both GMs (Jon for 3D6, Eric for AV) are highly skilled and do an impressive performance. I thought I post some observations I made listening to them and comparing them, if anyone wants to chime in and discuss then I'm happy for all input!

(Obviously everything below is my own opinion. I've tried to avoid spoilers for *Arden Vul*.)

**Same players vs. open table**  
3d6 sticks with the same players, AV has an open table where anyone(?) can join, but many players are reoccurring. You definitely get more connection with the 3D6 players (they having better mic quality helps as well). The open table format makes it so that Eric forces all the AV sessions to start and end at a safe space. I never thought this would work when I started watching since 3D6 frequently gets stuck underground on major delves for >10 sessions, but it works great in practice which is pretty impressive. This also makes the in-game time move faster in AV which I like, 3D6 crams so much action into a few weeks that it sometimes feels unbelievable to me.

Overall I'm very impressed by the AV campaign (but it may just be that it's new and fresh for me) and it really shows that it's possible to run an open table using its methods.

**Canon**  
Both GMs stay close to Arden Vul as it's written, but they sometimes stray. Eric is a bit more liberal with the source material, sometimes changing stuff for no clear reason (as far as I can see). Jon has a tendency to ""amp up"" powerful enemies into unbeatable forces-of-nature, which I don't enjoy at all, but it doesn't happen that often so I can live with it. Erics changes are more often ""minor"" and tend to benefit the players and give them information or point them in the ""right"" direction. Both GMs tend to stray when the players go in an unexpected direction and find complicated rooms they haven't prepped, which is totally understandable. Both tend to retcon things from time to time, which is also understandable and they both do it fairly and elegantly IMO.

**Random encounters**  
Random encounters in 3D6 are pretty rare. I think this matches the rates in the adventure. In AV, random encounters seem to happen all the time. I thought this would kill the pace but I found myself enjoying it: the encounters are often optional or avoidable. I like how Eric frequently has wandering monsters block an entrance to the dungeon, which forces the players to change their plans and go explore somewhere else (which works since Arden Vul has so many places to explore). Overall it really makes the setting come alive.

**Information**  
Both GMs are very generous with information such as rumors, finding secret doors etc. compared to my interpretation of OSE as written. Eric goes one step further and has Thieves find secret doors and traps basically for free, often without even specifying that they are looking. Both approaches work: the 3D6 approach feels more fair but it's fun to watch the AV party gorge themselves on secrets.

**Pace**  
3D6 is more traditional, having the players do more of the ""OSR pixelbitching"" (for lack of a better term). Jon is very good at describing every detail of an encounter, even parts that may seem inconsequential or unimportant. But sometimes Jon puts down his foot and say ""there's nothing here"" or similar when the players get stuck trying to analyse the window dressing. AV is more ""railroady"" in a sense, Eric frequently tells the players conclusions they can make, he quickly skips through a couple of rooms to get them to where they're going, and he can hint very strongly at what the players ""should"" do next. I think AV kind of overdoes it, but I understand the need since the sessions need to end at a safe place. The higher pace also makes AV progress a lot faster: the party explores more and meets more NPCs than what 3D6 does in a similar time. The 3D6 approach is better even though I feel like its players sometimes forget that they are too ""high level"" to get stuck in ""low level"" problems that they have brute force solutions to. Game time is the most valuable resource IMO.

**Time wasters**  
Both podcast have an issue where pretty boring or inconsequential fights take too much time for my liking. The table might spend 30 minutes rolling dice to end up with five dead baboons and some wasted spell slots. AV also has the Luck resource from Shadowdark and a whole minigame around managing it (especially if any PCs are playing the Sage class). Even if it only takes a few minutes each session it eats table time and focus for no real benefit to the game IMO.

**Sunk costs**  
I'm impressed by how often AV players lose major magic items without much concern to try to retrieve them. AV players also use consumables much more liberally than the 3D6 party. The 3d6 players are more ""traditional"" and tend to hoard their resources and be very miserly about losing anything (often spending lots of table time to prevent the loss of some resource they could have found twice the amount of by continuing their delves). I think the difference is caused by the open table nature that makes players less attached to their stuff and characters, and more willing to take risk for great gain. I think good advice to players is to play in the AV style: use your resources, take risks and know that there's always more of the good stuff so don't be afraid to use it. 

**Story (spoilers ahead)**  
>!It's very interesting to see how both parties go down similar roads: Both hate the halflings and invest disproportionate resources into their destruction. Having NPCs that are obnoxious and take the players stuff really does aggravate them even if it's only a minor annoyance in the grand scheme of things. Both end up allying with the goblins. Makes sense since the goblins are accessible and not-obviously-evil, but it seems like the Settites or the Beastmen could fill a similar role in other campaigns. The beastmen are treated completely differently, likely because the first encounter in AV was hostile but 3D6 was non-hostile. First impressions really do matter.  !<",osr,1726060186.0,1,6507,1122
585,11,1jby5ie,Dark & Darker - a video game you can check if you need to scratch that itch,"I've recently come across this game called **Dark and Darker** and gave it a go when I wanted to play video game with old-school dungeon delving theme.

587,16,1es0v0q,Kinda annoyed trying to convert 5e stuff to Deathbringer,"I have Professor Dungeon Master's Deathbringer. I've decided to finally run a one shot with it. I really like the premise and think the classes are very cool. I'm behind it.

It doesn't provide any spells, but instead encourages you to pick them from 5e or apparently any OSR game. That's fine; I don't mind the idea of customizing what spells to use. I go through the 1st level 5e spells and pick 8 for a d8 starting spell table (5e is the resource I have access to/knowledge of). So far, so good.

Then I go to pick monsters, and I realize the problem here. He encourages you to pick monsters from 5e or OSR games with the caveat of not applying CON bonuses to their HP to better match HP in Deathbringer.

Big problem: 5e's monsters aren't made with the same assumptions of Deathbringer! In fact, I can't be entirely certain on what all those assumptions are. First level Deathbringer characters range from 1-10 starting hit points, so I figure generic grunt monsters probably should have d6 HP. Maybe. That doesn't really align with the monster design and hit dice math behind 5e monsters, though. Even a mere goblin has 2d6 (if you ignore the CON bonus as he suggests).

This tracks with armor class, where I don't really know what a reasonable armor class for a monster to have. I can guess, but that's not that reassuring. Same for attack bonuses.

I'm thinking maybe I'll try running 5e monsters out of the box as he suggests, with no CON bonuses to HP or bonus actions, and they will just tonally be much tougher for this gritty world than they are in 5e. That fits what he's going for, I guess.

Overall, I like what he's going for with Deathbringer, and it seems like a great bridge to the OSR for 5e-firsters like me. I just can't help but think that this product makes a lot of assumptions about the experience and competency of the DM running it (not to besmirch myself or anything, but I'm really not confident homebrewing monsters for a system I'm new to). And I'm kinda doubtful of how smoothly 5e content can be converted into it.",osr,1723640093.0,1,2048,372

In short, it was fun, and I'm going to back it. Lighter than OSE, with more interesting crunch than lighter games (Knave, Cairn). I never played the first edition, but 2e has changed in some significant ways according to the author, and it was easy to pick up and play, as I literally downloaded the quickstart minutes before we began playing.

Character creation was a matter of minutes and lead to an interesting PC that was easy to slip into and play. We played entirely theater of the mind (first time in a while for me if I'm honest) and it was super simple and engaging. Combat was fast, interesting (very interesting), and horrifying.

I’ve been testing Shadowdark for 3 sessions for now and I miss some stuff from other systems and dislike some little points about the game:

-Magic roll is frustrating for the players, mainly for the reason that it is just their pure modifier to roll. Other systems (like DCC) have other resources to increase the casting chance, Shadowdark does not despite the talent increase.

-Specific wandering monsters tables (by level and terrain as OSE) and number appearing. The how many section is oversimplified and may cause strange balance on encounters.

-Some “monsters” also have to roll for their spells + the players DC to save as well. So there is a double chance that the death ray from the archmage fail. 1 DC to cast and another one in players DC to avoid it.

-Distance nomenclature is not that useful.

# ADVENTURE REVIEW: OPERATION UNFATHOMABLE

**Author/Publisher:** Jason Sholtis/Hydra Cooperative

**System:** Swords & Wizardry

**Level Range:** 1-2? Or maybe a bit higher? Nothing is balanced anyways.

# THE PITCH

You and your party are press-ganged into searching for a lost prince of an evil empire who has run off into the underworld with a powerful magical artifact seeking glory. You’ll follow his trail into the chaotic underdark to retrieve the artifact and hopefully earn your freedom.  

# CONTEXT

I bought this years ago and it’s been sitting on my shelf forever. My group just finished our Tunnel Goons campaign “Retro Rascals” and we weren’t ready to go back to straight up ‘vanilla fantasy’ yet. So, as a transition we finally busted out Operation Unfathomable. Was played at my kitchen table using a heavily house ruled OSE. It took us four sessions of about 3-4 hours each to finish. Shorter than expected but in a good way!

# PREP TIME

I’ve had this book on my shelf and read it in bits and pieces a lot over the last few years without having played it. The book is well-organized for at-the-table reference, with separate sections for random events, location descriptions, bestiary, magic items, etc. 

The process for rolling random encounters is more complex than a lot of modules. The book contains 44 detailed random encounters divided into separate tables for “Underworld Phenomena”, “Competing Parties & Underworld Travelers”, and “Wandering Horrors.” This is a GOOD thing because the encounters are richly-described and contain loads of world-building and gonzo experiences for players. But, I found it best if I pre-rolled a bunch of encounters before we came together at the table since it required a couple of rolls and a fair bit of reading and flipping to sort out what was happening. If I rolled and read the encounters in advance it made things flow much more smoothly at the table. 

The map is interesting and has icons built into it to indicate common environmental things like piles of debris and fungus gardens that have their own tables and procedures attached to them. I found it easy to describe the size of caves and general details to players so that they could navigate. The location descriptions are similarly fun and gonzo but can be wordy. It’s usually something I don’t like but it was worth it in the case of Operation Unfathomable because the locations and happenings were so gonzo and creative!

# AT THE TABLE

From the start this adventure grabs hold of you and pulls you in with crazy sights, ridiculous creatures, compelling side quests, and deadly encounters! I’ve never played such a bonkers but ultimately coherent and well-conceived dungeon.

It’s a bit wordy and that can slow things down sometimes but it’s absolutely worth the time you’ll take to read ahead and prepare.

Players were constantly engaged with interesting risks and weird and interesting situations. They knew enough to hide or run for their lives from some of the incredibly dangerous wandering monsters. Pushing buttons resulted in enough positive and cool outcomes early on that they were keen to experiment and take risks. 

The dungeon map has loads of different ways to travel around, lots of loops, and useful landmarks for players to orient themselves. I printed the way simplified player map that comes with the book and it was useful to get the players started on their exploration. I bookmarked the GM map in the book and it was very useful and well-labeled. 

The book is organized in a very effective way so you can flip through at the table and find what you need pretty easily. The pictures and artwork in the book are phenomenal and hilarious: you’ll want to show them to your players to set the tone and have a laugh together!

# OLD SCHOOL VIBES

Operation Unfathomable definitely brings the Old School vibes. Players are immediately thrust into action way over their heads and the pressure stays on. Even though the situations are unbalanced and seemingly unfair, players get a hold of a lot of powerful magic items and tools that they can use to more than even the odds: even for a party of first level players! 

Not all the encounters are combat-related! In fact, more than often players will have the chance to talk their way out of trouble or just have interesting and fun interactions with the denizens and visitors to the underworld that they will meet. 

The setting is the best-realized gonzo-style old school that I’ve played. Law & Chaos factor in as concepts (but not in any high-falootin’ way); psychic mushroom scientists offer mutation inducing fungus spores for players to experiment with; time-travelling humanoid animals seek to prevent the future apocalypse; and a cult of headless remote-controlled worshippers form a political alliance with a 50-foot long chaos godling worm. This barely scratches the surface of the insanity this module contains. But it somehow ‘makes sense’ in the context of the setting. It’s special.

# TREASURE AND LOOT

I don’t recommend inserting this module into an existing campaign: there’s a good chance that the magic items and loot that your players will find will be game-breaking in your normal campaign.

At the start of the mission players are provided with a stockpile of scrolls, exploding swords, amulets and other magic items to assist them in their quest. As the adventures unfold the party will have access to powerful magic items. In the context of Operation Unfathomable this is a strong positive: the magic items help to balance the scale and give players the chance to actually survive and impact the environment. In addition to physical items, there are loads of opportunities for characters to mutate themselves to gain interesting and OP special abilities and attacks. 

The exploding Sword of Demolition +1 was instrumental in ‘softening up’ a chaos godling when it was used as a suppository. Later, the godling was ultimately defeated when the Wooly Nelson, the Wooly Neanderthal player character, climbed into the worm sultan’s behind and used his newfound fungus-induced ability to explode into magical blue flame to finish the job.

WARNING! Early in one of the first sessions my players encountered science fungoids who repaid the party with Antipersonnel Puffball Fungi as a reward for being guinea pigs in their mutating experiments. This wasn’t without risk: one of the PCs erupted with spores and died immediately. However,  in hindsight I handed out too many (just enough?) of the Antipersonnel mushrooms as a reward. The players used these to massively turn the tide in numerous encounters with overwhelming numbers of baddies. They are very powerful and maybe should be handed out sparingly.

# MONSTERS AND FACTIONS

I don’t think there are any vanilla monsters in this entire module! Every encounter, every NPC, every wandering monster is unique to the setting and the majority are unique in each pre-designed encounter. The sheer overwhelming creativity that Jason Sholtis unleashes in this adventure is unbelievable. There are very few other modules that cram so much creativity and gonzo bliss into so few pages. To me, this is singular Old School D&D genius. 

You’ve got noble hybrid animal-fungi creatures from an alternate dimension called Blind Antler Men; headless remote controlled cultists of Null; slugman merchants; worm soldiers, an infant chaos godling named Thrantrix the Ineffable whose body is made of millions of writhing snakes, an immortal red-furred giant grieving its lost mate, mind bats, segmented giant underworld janitors, ancient beetle ghosts, and more . . . so much more.

# TRAPS AND PUZZLES

Finding the lost prince and the magical artifact proved a fun challenge. His shenanigans left a trail of corpses that the players were able to follow for a distance and many of the encounters with underworld NPCs provided additional clues and breadcrumbs. The map didn’t have any traps of the traditional variety. However, there are loads of buttons to push, mushrooms to munch, and risk-reward scenarios for players to monkey around with that can provide fantastic and powerful boons or crippling or fatal outcomes for the players. 

At the end of the module my surviving player characters were forever changed! One turned into a humanoid mushroom with telepathic communication abilities. Another had his eyes turn golden and gained the ability to detect good/evil and magic at will. One PC and many NPC retainers met all kinds of hilarious and horrible ends as they experimented with the flora, fauna, and artifacts they discovered. 

# GM CHALLENGES

Like I mentioned earlier, the drawback to having well-detailed and interesting encounters is that there is a lot to read before you can get rolling with some of them. Most sessions I rolled in advance to select the encounters so I’d be better aware of what was going to happen. The session I didn’t I felt rushed and having to read first then describe to players slowed things down. No one complained, but it was harder for me. 

Other than that, the module is really easy to play and run. The encounters are absolutely mental, so you need to think on your feet sometimes and make stuff up on the fly, but the gonzo-tone of the adventure makes you feel comfortable doing it: it’s too wacky for you to worry much about breaking anything. For example, after obtaining the Null Rod – the MacGuffin artifact and anti-chaos mega-weapon –  the party visited the mouth of the Oracle of the Bottomless Pit. Teaming up with Dr. Thorontius (humanoid bear cosmology professor from the future) the team decided to destroy the Null Rod to prevent his rival and nemesis from using it to alter the space time continuum to create a robot apocalypse in the future. They asked the Oracle if tossing the Null Rod in his mouth (a bottomless pit) would destroy it. 

 . . . that’s not an answer the module provides!

I decided that since the center of the earth is a source of raw Chaos the Null Rod would eventually nullify all the Chaos there, ultimately upsetting the balance between Law and Chaos that sustains our reality and slowly but surely destroying the world. He then gave a hint to a Chaos Battery (found in Odious Uplands, the sequel to Operation Unfathomable and our next adventure!) that could reverse the polarity of the Null Rod and render it vulnerable to physical destruction. 

Well, you decide for yourself if that was a good ruling or not. My players bought it and I found a link to our next module. If you could handle that level of ad-lib then this module will be easy for you.

# PARTY OUTCOME

There aren’t many reviews of Operation Unfathomable online, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. My players entered the underworld with 3 level one PCs: Fartwolf the Fighter, Wooly Nelson the Wooly Neanderthal (a class unique to this module), and Eggy Weiner the Thief. In the first session, Eggy experimented with science fungoid spores and turned into a humanoid mushroom man. We used the stats of the Mycelian from Carcass Crawler #3. However, he got captured in a failed raid on the throne room of Shaggath-Ka, the local Chaos Godling, and the player rolled up a new character: Dorox Thundershield the Blue Dwarf who soon got a fungal brain infection and had his intelligence reduced significantly. Don’t eat strange mushrooms, kids!!

In the second session the party discovered and defeated Shaggath-Ka the Worm Sultan with the help of Antipersonnel Puffballs, a motley crew of suicide mission-sworn retired Paladins, and a host of weird magical abilities and mutations they had gained.  Big win and unexpected! Amazing what exploding neanderthal enemas can accomplish! His conniving worm-son, Shaggankh, was grateful to the party for expediting his father’s demise and his coronation as worm sultan and allowed them to leave with their lives as a reward.

In session three the party continued their search for the Null Rod or some evidence of the absent prince’s whereabouts. They explored deep into the map and discovered a lot of the lore and history of the underworld. They also met some interesting NPCs, had a bunch of battles and whittled away at their supply of retainers and magic items. 

In the fourth and final session the party found the corpse of the lost prince, retrieved the Null Rod from a micro-sized civilization of Nanuits living in a frozen cave and beat a fast retreat to the surface. Some very lucky rolls and their remaining Antipersonnel Puffballs made handy work of the small Imperial strikeforce awaiting their return at the surface and the Citizen Lich Sorcerer leading the brigade who had designs to take the party prisoner and steal the rod back for the Empire. 

The players are now free and clear in the untamed wilds of Upper Mastadonia and ready to begin exploring the hexcrawl sequel to Operation Unfathomable – The Odious Uplands! 

It’s worth noting that they are mostly almost at 3rd level now. There is not a lot of gold and riches to plunder in the underworld. I gave 500 bonus milestone XP when they killed the Chaos Godling and when they completed the module to compensate and celebrate those pretty cool achievements. That may be sacrilegious to some so know that there’s not a lot to support leveling up if you’re strictly XP for Gold style. 

I expected this adventure to take way longer than it did. However, I’m really happy with how it went and glad that the players made it through so much wacky content in our four, three-and-a-half hour sessions. Very successful!

# FINAL THOUGHTS

I’m so happy we played this. It’s goofy and fun and full of amazing memorable encounters. It’s a pretty beefy module with a lot of words and amazing artwork that you’ll be absolutely dying to share with your players when they encounter some new transdimensional monstrosity. It’s not as easy as some of the OSE-style dungeon modules to run but it’s worth the extra effort to read & roll ahead. We are all super-excited to continue with the setting in Jason Sholtis's follow-up setting/module Odious Uplands!

*NOTE: We used the DCC module “Frozen in Time” as a funnel before playing Operation Unfathomable and it was a pitch perfect match in terms of tropes and themes. Definitely recommended: it’s a really good module itself and the text-heavy DCC module experience kinda prepared me to run Operation Unfathomable right after.

596,30,16t7klx,Swords and Wizardry Complete Revised kicks ass.,"After running two sessions of S&WC:R (the latest version), I can safely say that out of all of the rulesets I've picked up since jumping into the TSR era of rules, this clone has absolutely blown me away.

I've run BECMI/RC, OSE, Whitebox FMAG, and \*WN, and I wish I had started with S&W from the jump.

My favorite bits, in no particular order:

* 20 levels, optionally going further (I tend to run years-long campaigns with a solid group)
* Race is not class
* Fighters beat ass, gaining an attack against any 1 HD creatures in range from level 1
* Monks beat ass
* AD&D player options, Basic D&D game loop
* Loose, fluid rules for easy rulings
* Bolt on OSRIC or Classic D&D rules to fill any gap, no conversion required.
* Players \*instantly\* gelled with it, after chafing against OSE and BECMI. (We all started with 3.5 for context)
* My existing OSR library functions as the supplemental material for this system.

The real killer though was that it's 40 bucks for the whole game in one hardcover book, and after the eyewatering costs for OSEs (great!) hardcovers, this was a pleasant surprise.

I know the ruleset has been around for a while, but as a newcomer to playing the grand daddy of the hobby (OD&D + Supplements), Swords and Wizardry has been a breath of fresh air over the race-as-class of B/XCMI, which for my players was inevitably going to feel stifling, even if they liked the simplicity and fast chargen.

If you haven't played it, or if you're new to the OSR, pick up a copy. If you have played it, surely you know what I'm blathering about.

**LEVEL RANGE:** *1-5*

# THE PITCH

*A strange and legendary mountain has emerged from the depths of the sea. Strange fish-people are attacking ships and waylaying travelers. The pirate shanty-town of Port Fortune is where your quest to uncover the secrets of the Black Crag begins.*

# CONTEXT

I backed this Kickstarter many moons ago when I saw that it was being written by Chance Dudinack. I played and loved his ‘Black Wyrm of Brandonsford” many times and knew that this would be a winner. 

We spent the better part of a year playing this in-person weekly or bi-weekly with one GM and two PCs. Lots of retainers died in the making of this review.

# PREP TIME

I read the book one time from front to back over the course of a couple of hours. It’s not that long.

I strongly recommend reading the section at the front of the book about the history and background of the Black Crag: once the party enters that final dungeon it will help the GM a lot to know what the goals of the different factions are. 

Understanding and/or deciding the relationships between Red Rathbone (mayor of Port Fortune), the Sea Hag, the Merfolk, and the Tatunca villagers ahead of time would benefit the GM in the long haul.

Awesomely, the book contains all the content needed to manage ocean travel so it was a great quick reference during play. I still needed the OSE rule book to look up some spells for my players but most of the adventure content is found in the book, including monster & ship stat blocks and magic item effects. 

There are plenty of random tables to roll on if you want to ‘prep as you play’. There are fantastic resources for creating fun and flavorful NPCs on the fly and some very useful pre-made pirate ships & crews that came in super handy. 

NPCs are unique and all have enough ‘personality’ to make them stand out against each other and be easy to roleplay for the GM without having to remember too much. Likewise, the relationships and goals of factions and NPCs are described well and simple enough to run without getting bogged down or needing to cross reference anything.

Take note: some of the labels on the downloadable content don’t match the numbers and letters in the book. This was my one gripe that made things clunky sometimes at the table. Absolutely not a deal-breaker though! Just a smudge on an otherwise fantastic experience.

Overall, this was very easy to run “seat of the pants” and I was super-impressed by the clear layout and ‘just enough’ descriptions. I never planned ahead for a single session and we had a fantastic time.

# AT THE TABLE

My party hadn’t played a pirate/nautical themed adventure so this was an eye-opener. After their first day at Port Fortune they attempted to sail the seas in a tiny dinghy. They got lost and a random table had them stuck on a sandbar after their boat was struck by lightning and capsized. The ocean became a ‘faction’ on its own at that point. 

At sunrise, a legendary Great White Shark began circling. The fighter managed to harpoon a makeshift raft to it and leap on its back and steer the beast to the closest island. 

The different islands provided loads of exciting themed experiences. There were giant birds, strange glowing space-eggs, cave monsters, monkey temples and all the fun stuff you’d hope for. Session-to-session the party would just decide what unexplored place to visit or stop by on the way to the place they were heading and they’d often find more than they’d bargained for. 

# OLD SCHOOL VIBES

Black Crag is packed with interesting factions and relationships. Much like Chance Dudinacks other adventure “The Black Worm of Brandonsford,” there are loads of relationships and connections between locations and NPCs built into the game that lead players to make interesting and world-impacting decisions. 

They developed interesting ad-hoc relationships with the different factions and were able to come up with their own interesting goals and designs. As the adventure progressed they promised vengeance against the captain of an imperial treasure barge, Lord Duke Baron, who had embarrassed them early in the adventure. One player, after being mutated during a magical pact to gain water breathing abilities, decided to woo the Queen of the Mermaids. Not surprisingly, the party started collecting ships and trying to make their own fleet.  It was pretty epic.

Exploration is a big part of the game. The map of the Salamander Islands was very useful. I printed out an 11x17 size copy of it for the players and they traced their travels and made notes on it using a red pen. It was a useful tool, fun prop, and a great keepsake of the adventure! It provided the chance for meaningful and engaging overland exploration in addition to dungeon delves.

Dungeons have lots of different paths through and there’s often more than one way to solve a problem or make it across a trap. Magical crystals can be found at different places across the map that can be used in multiple dungeon locations so sometimes it’s worth it to revisit a dungeon to use a crystal you’ve found to access a new area. Likewise, some areas in dungeons are flooded and require water-breathing to make meaningful progress through. Accessing potions of water-breathing and longer term solutions became a goal of it’s own in our campaign.

Encounters are definitely not balanced: the party got in hot water a few times and loads of retainers were slaughtered. We ran with lots of retainers from the pirate crews and the cost to convince them to join skyrocketed as word spread of how much of a death sentence it was to be a retainer for the party.

There’s an awesome classic flavor to this adventure with just enough creativity to make it fresh. Giant statue guardians, enormous fauna, volcanoes, strange progenitor races, and the like all make for a super-fun old school vibe. Black Crag doesn’t ever reach ‘gonzo’ levels of weirdness but there’s just enough strange in there to keep things interesting, mysterious, and fun. 

# TREASURE AND LOOT

The best treasure was always finding another ship to add to the fleet. 

The loot varied from low-key player-creative stuff like a voice-recording mechanical parrot, to utility items like a conch shell that creates air bubbles for underwater exploration, to magical swords and tridents. There are scads of pirate loot to collect and my players went from Level 1 to Level 5 pretty easily by looting hordes and treasure ships full of gold bars, coins, and other trade goods like casks of whiskey, etc.

The most impactful treasure was a water producing sea-dragon’s pearl that was used to flood a barricaded temple and commit monkey genocide to prevent the rise of an intelligent simian empire.

All that said, the loot may be the weakest part of the module. Nothing made the players stand up and shout. I added in some homebrew items that made use of the gems that I knew the players would enjoy to compensate.

# MONSTERS AND FACTIONS

There are lots of unique monsters to this module. Standouts for our adventure were a giant, two-headed roc, the named megalodon shark, intelligent monkeys, precursor beings, and the sea dragon. 

# TRAPS AND PUZZLES

Most of the puzzles and traps rely on player’s accessing magical gems to proceed. This can make things a bit simple sometimes but it’s also good because players rarely got stumped by puzzles they couldn’t solve. The traps had pretty simple solutions in most cases which I think is good. It gave players pause for thought without frustrating them entirely. I wouldn’t say that this module is characterized by complex or intriguing puzzles though.

# GM CHALLENGES

As a GM, I needed to get savvy with ship-based combat and ocean travel rules, which I had not used before. Thankfully, all the info I needed was in the Black Crag book so quick reference was easy. 

Managing crew-vs-crew combat was also something new for me. I wound up buying some cubes of Chessex mini-d6’s and houseruling group combat basically using the rules from RISK. It worked and was still fun!

Some of the events that could occur were game-changing and led to end-game scenarios that exceeded the scope of the book to describe and run. The final session required a bit of prep on my part to prepare. The map significantly changed and technologies that were not present before came into play. However, we ran this campaign for the better part of a year and the only prep I needed to do was for the finale, so I think that’s fair.

Once more, some of the map labels didn’t match the book which made at-the-table reference a pain sometimes. However, the book is pretty slim and I was still able to cope. Not a deal-breaker. 

# PARTY OUTCOME

Our party ultimately succeeded in solving the mystery of the Black Crag and becoming the most notorious pirates in the Salamander Archipelago. Two main characters became wedded to local royalty, one was unrecognizable after being blinded, mutated, and losing his true name in ill-fated bargains with a sea witch. 

We ended with a bit of a cliffhanger as one of the possible ‘big bads’ in the adventure became empowered through the PC’s actions. We may revisit it as a one-shot to have a final battle! 

# FINAL THOUGHTS

This campaign is one of the best I’ve ever run as a self-contained module. We got almost a year of weekly or bi-weekly gaming out of it and I pretty much never had to prep anything, so that’s a massive win. If you are looking for a pirate-themed campaign this rings the bell. The scope is big enough for exploration and fun but contained enough to be manageable and have interesting domino effects occur. 

Players really got into watching their characters mutate and evolve, designed their own ‘jolly roger’ flags and named their ships, and grew their influence and renown as pirates. The campaign never got dull and always felt fun and exciting.

609,47,1h9zpd4,"Mothership Review, OSR with Newbies, and Running and re-writing a module on the fly","Last week, I ran Mothership TTRPG for the first time, for a group of friends who have never played Mothership, have little (no?) experience with OSR-style gaming, and many of us had not played a ttrpg together. New rules, new people, new play style. You’d think this would be a recipe for a bad time, but we had a blast. Mothership sells itself as a spooky, deadly sci-fi horror game and it delivered.

This isn’t a a review per se, but a mish-mash of reflection-review-pondering. I want to document some of the pro’s and cons of my experience as a Warden, as well as some commentary on the game, OSR, and module. 

**Prep:** 

In preparing to run the game, I read through the Player’s Guide, Warden’s Manual, and the full Another Bug Hunt module. I decided early on that I was going to challenge myself with running a module (which I have only done a few times in my gaming career, preferring to create my own worlds and stories instead). On this first read through, a few things stood out to me as worth noting. 

First, the main mechanism for pressure in the game is the Stress mechanic. Whenever a roll goes poorly, stress increases. Eventually, this should lead to difficulties succeeding at rolls, and eventually Panic checks. This sets up the rhythm of increasing tension throughout a session, where there is a spiral down toward the eventual demise or bare survival of the party. This is where the Fun(TM) lives in the game. 

Second, the Warden’s Manual does a great job teaching how to set up the peaks and valleys of a good horror game, creating tension, relieving tension. The Warden’s manual is the advice book I wanted to exist when prepping horror for Stars Without Number, Darkhope, and the several sessions I’ve run of Dread.  I’m really excited to use it deliberately in future games.

Third, at first glance, the one-shot scenario in Another Bug Hunt reads as an Aliens 2 rewrite.  It was surprising how much our play session ended up as a different experience entirely. 

Additionally, as I was prepping for the game, I wanted to test myself to improvise on the fly and not need to do heavy prepping. I made no notes, but tried to visualize areas in the module, understand where the pressure and relief would come from, and think through how to create that feeling at the table. Whether that succeeded or not is up to my players, but I didn’t feel particularly unprepared at any time during the session.

**What went well:** 

**Digital dice and character creation:**

Mothership has a character creation app, that allows a character to be created in literally 5 minutes or less. Select a class, click some buttons for stats and saves, and decide if you want a random loadout or not. 

And then, throughout the whole session, your character is on your phone. Need to roll a combat check at advantage? Click click, then a the result. And it automatically adds stress on a failure.  I never noticed how much time at the table could be spent on asking what dice to roll and interpreting. Using the app was seemless. 

**Rhythm:**

Setting the horror tone and creating pressure: I had already decided that the game would operate in 3 Acts. Act 1 was discovery, some exploration and the first sign of real threats. Act 2 was about the first encountered with the aliens, and Act3 was the death spiral and the rush to escape. This worked super well! Tension mounted and was released throughout the night, and it was really fun to watch how the players interacted and played with the game pieces. In the “didn’t go well” section, I talk about how some elements of the tension *weren’t* relieved and why this made for a bad writing and threw off some of the rhythm. 

**Player engagement:**

The horror element, the setting, knowing that your characters were disposable and designed to be either. The players screamed, complained, laughted. It was wonderful. 

**Knocking the rust off:**

This was the first RPG I’ve run in about 3 years. I’ve played some GMless games, and a played as a character a few times, but it’s been awhile since I actually ran a game. Given that, things went great! 

**What didn’t go well:**

**Transitioning from module description to improvised description:**

You know how boring it to listen to someone just read their PowerPoint slides? The same thing happens with reading out of a module. The descriptions are good but sparse. Because I’m not used to running modules, there were several times when I simply read out of the module the descriptions, and did not further embellish. From my view, this is wrong and novice work. My job as a GM-Warden, is to create in my player’s mind an idea of what they are encountering and seeing and merely reading out of the module just isn’t sufficient. I will do better next time! This was my biggest personal critique of the night and seems like an easy enough fix.

**OSR style play:**

As a mild qualifier to the above point, it is also a characteristic of OSR-style play for the players to ask for more information, ask questions, literally describe what their characters do. It’s common for players who have been steeped in modern DnD to struggle with this. In modern DnD, your character sheet describes what you can do and what you’re good at. In OSR games, there are no skills or feats or class abilities to support you; your character sheet is sparse. Player skill is paramount and one of the critical skills is asking questions. 

We ran into a few snags in this and frankly, I did a mixed job of encouraging this style of play, definitely resorting back to a modern DnD style of GMing around combat encounters.

Despite this being a bit clunky, this was the most fun element of the game to me, forcing my players to simply describe what they wanted to do. The number of bids that were essentially “Perception” check requests because the players were scared to go into a room was amazing and it felt fun as a horror GM to say, “you’ll have to get closer and actually touch it to find out.” 

**Fear becomes paralyzing:**

Our session was a long one. I intended it to push along for about 3 hours or so, but we ended up playing for close to 5. Additionally, the module has “bad stuff” happen basically every time players do things, which I believe unintentionally teaches the players to stop interacting. In a way, this is kind of cool: a group of marines land on an alien world and slowly the morale breaks until they are feeling hopeless. But in practice, we had several stalling moments toward the end of the evening, where the players were both tired and it seemed like every pathway was bad or risky. 

I believe this is a feature of the game and not a bug, but that doesn’t make it good! Eventually, they pushed through and one of the players just said “Fuck it. I’m gonna go fight the damn thing,” and that spilled us into the final stages of Act 3. This has me wondering how I can create pressure and forward momentum so that those moments of paralysis don’t pile up. What a fun story-telling puzzle! 

**Another Bug Hunt Module:**

I touched on this in the above point, but it’s bad design to make most of the routes to success unexpected traps and problems. The module is riddled with “this seems like a good idea but surprise, it’s not.” The booby trapped armored vehicle in the same room as the first real encounter with the Carc marine is one such example.

Additionally, I find the Carc’s monster design boring. They are basically just biological chainsaws with no special abilities and thick skins. The reason that the xenomorphs of the Alien franchise work is because they have multiple stages (huggers, xenomorphs, queen), multiple objectives (defend, hunt, implant), can’t be attacked without the consequence of acid blood and they don’t always kill you. The carc’s are written to just attack and hurt you. 

I modified them on the fly to have their armor break, so they went from impossible to hurt, to suddenly harm able. (Though I wish I had telegraphed this better!) I also made them have a close range use of the Shriek, which could infect the players. Thinking of this further, I would have made them either slow and tankier or fast and fragile (maybe they can adapt and some skin color change indicates if they are in slow mode or fast mode?), and given them an obvious weakness to light or something like that. I wanted there to be some mechanism for the players to funnel the monster or to flee. More choices and less “Fight or flee.”  

**Playing in my GMing weakness:**

I am really good at characters, creating my own scenarios, social encounters and complex and fun combat encounters. This game was a sci-fi dungeon crawl written by someone else, with virtually no NPC’s, no real social encounters, with a highly simplified monster combat. Add on that this was a new game to me and the players, and I’m basically picking up one of the more challenging GMing tasks I could. I had so much fun getting the reps in on these skills, but it definitely felt like GMing with one hand behind my back. 

**Conclusion:**

Overall, I’m very pleased with the game. Most of the clunkiness we experienced can be attributed to a new system and using someone else’s created module, and most of the success can be contributed to clever and fun players, good tension and release cycles, and solid mechanical support from the Stress system. 

I’d love to run another few Mothership sessions, perhaps using other materials from Tuesday Games, or running my own game. I’d especially love to follow the advice of the Warden’s Guide, and build out a horror scenario using their structure.",osr,1733712037.0,1,9583,1685

I have to admit... I'm a bit ambivalent about it.

For one thing, it feels a bit lazy/undercooked. It's only a few pages, but there is at least one typo in it. It's supposed to be able to be transposed onto 5e, but I doubt much playtesting with that was actually done. It changes so much that I'm not really sure how you could use both products. 

The Deathbringer Dice are a very solid idea though. I think having flexible dice that can be used however you want is a great idea, though I do think one/level isn't really enough. 

Finally, the classes feel a bit... lackluster. Insufficient. The clerics/witchhunters/whatever are just worse fighters with one spell (if I remember correctly).

The spellcasting table is cool, though. 

As a big fan of his, I hate to be so negative about his baby, but it just seems insufficient.

I'm not a massive fan of most TTRPG reviews. I don't think they can always capture the essence of a system, how individual players would engage with it in a specific session, under the specific conditions it is run in, and with any given individual's specific GMing ""style"".

I am, however, a massive fan of [**Swyvers**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/melsonia/swyvers). I also think you, yes *you* dear reader, should give it a go. I did, and my players have been loving it since; I'll share some banger play reports one day I promise!

So, instead of trying to articulate what I find so great about the rules themselves, I'd like to focus on another aspect - just how brilliantly the rules are written...

Here is a sampling of my favourite phrases.

*""If literate, explain how:""*
*""Fish hook: up a fish, or under a nail.""*
*""Nasty tip — put a bottle in a sack, smash it up with a hammer. Throw powdered glass at people chasing you.""*
*""Mint Lawyer: like other lawyers but not shit.""*
*""Useless in a fight. Nobles love them, everyone else despises them. Tiny useless rat-dog.""*
*""Investments - Church. Dunno if donation is gonna be enough to sort us out, but might be worth a punt?""*
*""Sexual fluids become alcoholic. After two months of this, -3 con per day.""*
*""Carousing - You’ve got a ring on your finger and a spouse by your side. Shit.""*
*""No secret – as honest as they come (in this business).""*
*""Prudence Garland, bride-in-hiding.""*
***(All from the Swyvers preview 4 PDF)***

Too often when writing rules systems writers don't focus on writing. How you articulate the rules, and present an implied setting, is just as important as what rules you do create. Put some **voice** into your rule-books, even if it's just subtle!

As a result of Gearing's use of this voice, the Swyvers bestiary is a treat. Not just because there are some unique, beautifully grungy, creatures contained within - but because each foe and danger has a nickname or codeword given by locals. You really get the sense that hushed tales of *""Blinking Larrys""* and *""the Green Grocers""* swirl over whatever piss-ale they serve in the flea-bitten inns of The Smoke; and it builds up these creatures to a semi-legendary status.

So yeah, I really recommend [**Swyvers**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/melsonia/swyvers). [**The Kickstarter**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/melsonia/swyvers) has less than a week left (***!!!***) and I'm sad it hasn't raked in more cash; but I guess that's just the nature of TTRPGs right now. The world very much needs more games like Swyvers, designed as passion projects by people who love creating games foremost, and it is sobering to watch sharted out film tie-in games and soul-less 5e modules get more attention and money.

Heck, you can even (at time of writing) get the Swyvers rules for **$1** on [DriveThru](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/467572/swyvers-quickstart) and for **FREE** on [Itch](https://melsonian-arts-council.itch.io/swyvers) - but [Melsonia](https://www.melsonia.com/) know how to make nice physical books (Every Troika edition is a real gem) so you should go with dead-tree if you can afford it!

But yes, please [**back it**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/melsonia/swyvers) if this interested you - I think it's really good.

Me and him personally wouldn't have a problem with the small class selection but my other players might. So yea it's just something we discussed. OSE Classic overall has a very B/X feel to it which I 100% approve of.

**OSE Advanced:** Advanced also has the classic feel to it, not as much as Classic but to an extent it feels like classic but I am getting a lot of 1st edition D&D vibes from it which is a slight turn off since I was raised on 1st edition for 35-40'ish years . . . which makes me feel like *""damn do I want to play something new that has 1st edition written all over it""* I'm not saying it's a bas system, it just gives me that 1st edition feel and the entire reason for me coming to OSE was to go full blown classic.

So let me ask you folks that play OSE Classic/Advanced . . . Which version do you prefer and why? Do you prefer OSE Classic because it's more like B/X or do you prefer OSE Advance because of the 1st edition vibes it has?

626,72,1dkk9a8,RONIN SAGA Looks Amazing!,"u/True_Kobayashi released this lustrous new gem into the world and I have to say, WOW.

In short: it's everything good about Black Sword Hack: Ultimate Chaos with some modern fixes that make it even better.

My group and I got our hands on Black Sword Hack: Ultimate Chaos Edition last summer. I listened to the great interview on the Dieku Podcast and learned what a cool person Kobayashi is. We played it for months and ran a campaign set in Luke Gearing's ""Wolves Upon the Coast"" setting. It was so fun. That combination of lean and mean, fast to play, tons of cool things that can happen - we loved it. The natural end point approached - I think the party was up to 5th and 6th level (we used quicker levelling). We did notice the system started to creak a little as the power level got higher what with how 'roll under' works when you get high stats, but that was  a quibble. 

Imagine my delight on finding RONIN SAGA a day ago. I loved BSH. I love cool Japanese stuff. I am playing Ghost of Tsushima *right now* on PC. How was I NOT going to love this? Answer: I didn't have a chance. 

This is honestly a FANTASTIC game. Here I am trying so hard to not spend money on my favourite hobby but the products coming out are so good. How can I resist? 

Why is it good? The art, direct clear writing, open ended (but scaffolded) structure are an immediately BOOM. Sandbox, but with direction (You are exploring islands and rescuing/reclaiming them for the Empire). 

The rules are everything good about BSH but with a lot of small gripes simply fixed. The three stats (Brawn, Wits, Agility) and three skills (Bow, Blade, Sorcery) are added to a D20 (sometimes advantage/disadvantage plays a part) and then you beat a DC. Players roll to hit and to defend as in BSH. This seems even more streamlined than BSH and less prone to breakage as power level climbs. 

There's also a super cool Duel mechanic which I'm dying to use. I feel like I'm in Sword of Doom already! (When the sword point dips... someone is gonna die)

There are fantastic, flavourful monsters provided that give enough hints that you can design anything by extrapolating. I can tell right away I can run with this. 

And finally, beyond all the great materials, charts, random tables, etc that give you practically everything you need for a long campaign there is the core structure of the game. You go to and island that used to be part of the Empire and explore them and rescue/save the island and people. What this means is you can drop in everything you ever wanted to do. Expedition to the Barrier Peaks? That could be on an island. Hall of the Blood King? That could be on an island. OA2: Night of the Seven Swords? That could be on an Island. Did you always dream of converting Moebius: The Orb of Celestial Harmony to an rpg adventure? Here is the place. That's 5 more islands right there!

I can't recommend this high enough. We truly live in a diamond age.

631,83,1dt8qh3,"DDA3: ""The Eye of Traldar"" (1991) Review","# Intro

Some months ago, my friends and I watched several videos by [Mr. Welch](https://www.youtube.com/@Mr_Welch) talking about the old-school D&D setting Mystara. His passion for the game and its setting clearly showed though and it sounded incredibly interesting. So, I volunteered to run a game for my tabletop group.

I decided I wouldn’t do a conversion or anything, so I actually ran the game in BECMI using the RulesCyclopedia. 

I didn’t have much experience DMing though, so I asked for suggestions for good modules for first time DMs and got some pretty good tips (seriously, thank you so much for your suggestions everyone!). Following [this suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/19dxo6l/comment/kjd5oyk/) by the amazing u/Gigoachef, I decided to start with the module *The Eye of Traldar*.

My group just finished last week, so I thought I would give a review of my experiences with the module as well as my thoughts on the system in general.

# Summary

The adventure started with my players’ characters – a fighter, a magic-user, and elf, and a cleric – sitting around a campfire off the side of the main road. Suddenly a man rushes past on horseback, and his horse is shot out from under him. He falls into the camp and the group is now attacked by unknown assailants. The magic-user is able to dispatch half of them with a sleep spell while the elf and fighter pick off the others with their bow and sword, respectively.

After the battle the man introduces himself as Alexei. He was tracking down a magical artifact called the Eye of Traldar which can be used to control minds and was stolen by the evil Baron Ludwig von Hendriks of the comically named Fort Doom.

As they did not trust anyone operating from a place called “Fort Doom” to have an artifact that could control minds, the players all immediately volunteered to help Alexei recover the Eye.

The party heads to the nearby town of Luln where they get in ambush and the fighter dies. Next session, that player rolls up a dwarf and an NPC tells the party that the Baron is currently away and they’re keeping the eye in a mage’s tower inside the fort’s ~~keep~~ gatehouse. They are given some disguises and a Staff of Healing (which also happened to have five charges of Cure Disease on it) and then they head to the city of Fort Doom.

They meet another NPC in the city who tells them that the best way into the fortress is though some monster-filled caves which the Baron throws prisoners into. The caves themselves are a pretty standard. The players went through them room by room, killing various ghouls, skeletons, and even a carrion crawler. The real danger in this cave though? The giant rats.

Knowing that each time a rat hits you, you have a 5% chance of catching a disease which will kill you in 1d6 days, my players ran from the giant rats whenever they came across them and went out of their way to avoid the obvious rat room.

After killing the cave boss – a bugbear, his dog, and his three zombies – the players went up into the fort’s dungeons.

Like, the literal dungeons; the prisons below the fort.

Here’s where the adventure started getting interesting. The actual dungeon level was mostly non-linear, with multiple paths through it, giving the players lots of options in how to explore. First, the players questioned the prisoners for information and promised to free them on their way out.

They also found a torturer and his victim. They killed the torturer in a fight and then the edgelord player mercy killed the dying victim before he could use his last words to reveal where he had hidden his treasure.

Oh well!

They found and orc chained in a cell and decided to kill it. The magic-user then threw molotov cocktails at it until it burned to death. Of course, had they fed it and set it free, it would have joined them as an ally.

Oh well!

Eventually they found the guard barracks. A fight ensures and they get overwhelmed. In order to salvage the situation, the elf uses Charm Person on the head guard and they have the last remaining guard thrown in prison. They then get some information and head up into the ~~keep~~ gatehouse where they use some stolen uniforms to bluff the guards into letting them through without a fight.

This is where the main part of the adventure starts. The ~~keep~~ gatehouse contains large courtyard surrounded by high walls. In the middle is a three story mage’s tower. The players need to sneak around the courtyard either by night or in disguise. Going from building to building fighting or bluffing their way past enemies, grabbing treasure, and looking for the pass they need to get into the tower. It’s very non-linear and gives the plays a lot of latitude in how they want to approach it.

Or they could do what my one of my players did and skip all that by annoying the doorman of the tower until he actually called out his boss (a necromancer cleric) and he and his six skeletons come out and starts a fight.

Also, they split the party.

Do to a series of ridiculously lucky rolls they managed to not die (seriously, if I had not rolled so poorly, those skeletons would butchered the dwarf and cleric). And after turning the skeletons, the magic-user then put the cleric and some of the snipers on the battlements to sleep with a well aimed sleep spell allowing the party to easily dispatch them.

They then proceeded to enter the tower. Inside they found an alchemist (A low-level magic-user) and pressed him for information. After figuring that he was forced to work for the Baron and didn’t know anything, they let him go.

They continued up the tower until they got to the top floor where they had to fight all of its inhabitants at once; a magic-user, a thief, and that doorman. After charming the thief and killing the other two, they learn that they kicked up enough of a commotion that the Eye had been moved to the main gates and was being prepared to be sent to the Baron. They were also able to loot an elven cloak (enemies can’t detect the wearer unless they roll a 1 on a d6).

The players, now in panic mode, rushed out of the tower where they came across two skeletons standing over the body of the alchemist. Because, as it turns out, turning undead doesn’t make them go away forever!

After killing the skeletons, they ran to the gates leading into the fortress proper. They knew they couldn’t open them, so they decided to split the party, each group going into the buildings on either side of the gates to find the mechanism to open them. (They didn’t need to do this. They just needed to knock and they could have bluffed their way in!)

The elf and magic-user went to the left, opening the door and coming across a latrine filled with giant rats. The elf’s eyes watered as the smell hit her like a punch to the face. She closed the door without going in and they decided to join back with the other group.

The dwarf and cleric went to the right, breaking down the door to the room and immediately going murderhobo on the guard captain and his assistant. As the elf and magic-user came to help, the magic-user decided to (for reasons I cannot comprehend) pelt the door of the latrine with molotov cocktails.

This caused the noxious methane gas within to ignite and explode. This is the sort of thing the magic-user’s player does a lot (like he has ended several past campaigns for our other DM due to his character doing arson or blowing things up).

This immediately drew the attention of all the guards in the fort’s main gate. The magic-user immediately retreated into the guard station with the dwarf and cleric while the elf donned the elven cloak and tried to kill the enemy magic-user from behind.

The fighter, cleric, and the NPC Alexei (he’s still with the party; he’s a 3^(rd) level fighter) formed a choke point at the door of the building while the magic-user tossed molotov cocktails into the enemy lines. While he did kill a lot of enemies this way, he also flubbed one of his rolls and hit the cleric, burning him to death.

Oh well!

Just as the elf was getting overwhelmed I had the two characters she had charmed ride in and help dispatch some of the enemies that were surrounding her.

After dispatching the enemies, the players, knowing reinforcements were on their way, grabbed the Eye of Traldar off the enemy magic-user and the Staff of Healing off of the cleric’s burning corpse and made their escape.

The way they were *supposed* to do this according to the module was to steal some horses from the stable and bluff their way through the front gate. But, since the players did the mage’s tower first, they never found the stables.

So, they headed back through the dungeons, letting all the prisoners free (netting them a nice 50 xp per group), and going back out through the caves. Also the dead cleric’s player rolled up a thief and joined up with the party when they let him out of his cell.

Cleverly, they set a formation before entering the caves, with the dwarf and Alexei in the front, the prisoners and charmed NPCs taking up the center, and the thief, elf, and magic-user in the back.

This was smart, because I totally had the rats they didn’t kill on their first time through ambush them on their way out. That’s right! You thought you could get away with not killing all the enemies on a dungeon level!? Not on my watch! Muahahaha!

The rats seemed especially agitated and were covered in soot, as though something above their den had exploded somehow.

Anyway the players made it though without catching any disease from the rats and that basically ended the adventure. They rode off to Luln to report into the NPC there and then rode to the capital of Specularum to go on further adventures.

# My thoughts the adventure

Overall, *The Eye of Traldar* was a great experience. Fort Doom had some top-tier dungeon design. I can see why this module would be recommended for new players. It starts off simply before ramping up in complexity, letting the players and DM get used to the mechanics over time. The assault on the ~~keep~~ gatehouse itself is especially good in how open it is and how many ways there are to go about exploring it. The encounters were also set up in clever ways, requiring the players to think tactically about how to approach them.

The module also has tips for new DMs. Those were okay, but not perfect. A lot of them had to do with what to do if new players weren’t really getting into the “spirit” of D&D. But that was not really a problem with my players, who are pretty experienced at tabletop. On the other hand, a lot of areas that could have used some tips didn’t have much to offer. The dungeons are pretty open, with a lot of room for players to go off the rails. So some tips on what to do if the players took certain actions (like not finding the stables, for example) might have been nice.

There were a few small print mistakes in the book I had. For example, the titular Eye of Traldar first was listed as being stolen from the Lake of Lost Souls but later listed as being stolen from the Lake of Lost Dreams (Lake of Lost Dreams is the canon name. It’s the one that shows up on the official maps of Mystara). Also, Alexei promises 25 gold to the players for escorting him to Luln, but a different NPC is listed as giving them 50 when they arrive.

Also, the writers do not know what a “keep” is.

According to [medievalbritain.com](https://medievalbritain.com/type/medieval-life/architecture/parts-of-a-medieval-castle-the-keep/), a castle’s keep is “the strongest portion of a medieval fortification and the last resort in case of a siege or attack. It was usually a fortified tower built within the walls”. In the text, the module repeatedly describes the area the Eye of Traldar in as a “keep”, but it is absolutely not a keep. It has a gate leading into the fortress proper, as well as one leading into the town. This makes it a [gatehouse](https://www.exploring-castles.com/castle_designs/gatehouse/), not a keep.

It just bothered me, is all. It took me like, an hour of reading the module, looking at the maps, and researching medieval castles to figure out where this was supposed to take place.

But aside from that, excellent adventure. 10/10. No notes.

# Changes

While the adventure was really fun and well designed, I did make a few changes to it. Mostly just minor things for convenience or pacing.

The main change I made was to convert all the AC values from THAC0 to a more modern AC system using this [invaluable guide](https://caressofsteel.github.io/demos/dndrulescyclopedia/) from the amazing CaressofSteel. Seriously, the work they did in clarifying and correcting ambiguous or incorrect rules from the RulesCyclopedia was amazing. Thank you so much dude.

I changed some of Alexei’s introduction as well. In the module, he’s being chased by Iron Ring slavers when he runs into the player’s camp, forcing them to fight off *his* enemies just to defend themselves. It made him come off as a bit of an asshole. So, I made him fall into the camp by accident, that way it felt less like he was intentionally dragging the players into his problems.

I also cut out a lot of the exposition from the start. Alexei spends three long paragraphs describing his backstory to the players. It all came off as very convoluted, and didn’t actually have much to do with the plot of the module, so I cut most of it out. In the town of Luln, the players also had to visit multiple shops and talk to several NPCs who mostly felt extraneous to the adventure, so I combined most of those into a single encounter with a single NPC to simplify it and move them faster to the main adventure.

Near the beginning of the adventure, the players get a Staff of Healing. I added a few charges of Cure Disease to the it since a party of level one players will have no other way to treat disease, I thought that was my best option.

Finally, I implemented some variant rules from the August 1980 edition of Dragon Magazine for burning oil (molotov cocktails). Basically, on a failed roll, I roll a d8 and the bottle hits a random square around its intended target. This did end up killing the cleric, but it does kinda balance what is one of the strongest weapons at low levels.

# Thoughts on BECMI D&D

Overall, I found BECMI to be a really fun system to run. I’m more used to playing Pathfinder, so there were definitely some oddities, but it still runs really well. It’s especially interesting seeing the different assumptions in how the writers approached game design and balance.

It’s neat that the different races count as classes and that each class levels differently and has different level caps. That’s a unique way of balancing things.

One especially cool mechanic is that you can “microdose” certain potions. For example you can drink a potion of invisibility making you invisible for an hour, of you can divide it into six “sips” giving you ten minutes of invisibility per sip.

Combat is quick and satisfyingly deadly. None of my players’ characters had more than six health and most enemies could do a d6 of damage. So even a single mistake could be deadly, which forced the players to think carefully about when and how to engage in combat. So they often relied on bluffing their way out of combat or using underhanded tactics to avoid danger.

It was also interesting that initiative was rolled each round for the whole party, rather than individually, which gave the game a bit of a tactical, Fire Emblem-esque feel.

Skill checks are also done in a really unique way in this edition. Rather than getting a bonus based on your skill, you try and roll under that skill. So, if the party is trying to do an Int check, they roll a d20. The magic-user with an Int of 17 has to roll a 17 or less, while the fighter with an Int of 11 has a much lower margin of error. Since stats cap at 18, it actually makes a lot of logical sense when rolling a d20 to try and roll low, since there’s always a chance of failure, but each stat point feels like it really matters.

On the other hand, it does get a little confusing how the rolls aren’t consistent. For skills you want to roll low, for attacks you want to roll high. To search for secret doors you want a 1 on a d6, to open doors you want a 5 or a 6.

It’s pretty rules-light overall, so there’s a lot of room to improvise and interpret things. Which is cool! But some things just aren’t explained that well or left up to interpretation when more explanation would be better. Turning undead is a prime example of this, where there is a huge amount of discretion for the DM on how turned undead are supposed to behave and how long they actually stay turned. I also kind of wish The RulesCyclopedia was more well arranged. It’s often hard to find the information you need.

Another thing is that magic-users are a bit of a pain at level one. They only have one spell and no cantrips. So, once they cast their one spell, they’re basically dead weight. I do get that that’s part of the game balance; magic-users are supposed to be super weak at low levels, but if they survive they become terrifyingly strong. But, in practice, it makes them pretty boring to play at level 1 since they can’t meaningfully contribute except maybe once per dungeon level. That’s why about halfway through the adventure, I let my magic-user buy burning oil and a sling (which were allowed under an optional rule set), so they could do something even when they had used their spell for the day.

On the other hand, even certain first level spells could be terrifyingly powerful. Sleep is always cited as a particularly OP spell that can trivialize most low-level encounters. But, Charm Person is probably my favorite though, since it can have a potentially *infinite* duration. The spell has no fixed duration, but depending on the victims Int, they get a saving throw anywhere from every few hours to every few *weeks*. For a first level spell. It’s pretty amusing, honestly.

Overall though, I really enjoyed DMing *The Eye of Traldar* and running it in BECMI. My players are pretty interested in continuing, so we’re probably going keep playing for the foreseeable future. Next we might do a few minor adventures and then I’m hoping to do *Dark Knight’s Terror*. I’ve heard it’s a pretty good followup to *The Eye of Traldar*.",osr,1719880435.0,1,18328,3256

[The God That Crawls](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/105954/The-God-that-Crawls?affiliate_id=403100)\*, is a LotFP adventure by James Raggi (if you don't know LoTFP, [read this](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2023/01/a-glance-at-basic-d-bx-and-some-clones.html)). Here is the blurb:

>A murdering cult.A religious order dedicated to protecting sacred history.An ancient catacomb full of danger and reward.The God that CrawlsA  dungeon chase adventure for characters of levels 1–2 for use with  Lamentations of the Flame Princess Weird Fantasy Role-Playing and other  traditional role-playing games.

**Why did I buy/read this?** I find many LotFP adventures interesting, including [Better Than Any Man](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/116452/Better-Than-Any-Man?affiliate_id=403100), which you can get for free. So I've gathered some for my [current sandbox](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2022/10/sandbox-quest.html), including this one.

**Review**:Like  many LotFP adventures, this has awesome ideas, mixed with strange  stuff. It seems like they always intended to do something novel instead  of the tired ""goblins and skeletons in adjacent rooms"" that you can find  in many D&D adventures, and I commend them for that. On  the other hand, this taste for novelty sometimes makes the adventures  become ""anti-adventures"" - instead of something that is easy to use,  they become partially exciting, partially unusable.For example: instead of providing hooks, this book says:

>The hook or motivation to get the player characters to the church is up to the Referee, who would know how to get the players involved better than any adventure writer. No hooks that cast suspicion on the priest or villagers before the adventure begins should be used, as the natural paranoia of adventurer swill be in effect anyway.\[...\]Father Bacon is the leader of both the church, the community around it \[...\] He will be very adamant about not allowing visitors beyond the altar of the church. \[...\]   
>  
>It is perfectly possible (even likely with some groups) that player characters will not fall for any of the tricks and will not be trapped in the dungeon, especially ifthe Referee seems a little too eager to get them down there. No matter. If they just walk away, they are leaving a lot of treasure behind. If they do something rash like slaughter the priest and/or a bunchof villagers and walk away, they will havethe legitimate authorities after them soon and that will be adventure enough. Force nothing; this adventure provide san environment and a handy guide forresolving “What happens if…?” within that environment. This adventure is nota club with which to bludgeon players.

So,  you need a strong motive to invade a church, that the book doesn't  provide. On the other hand, if you do invade it, the book advises you  that the PCs should be drugged or captured by troops and tossed into the  dungeon. And if the PCs don't want to explore... eh, what can you do?  Maybe choose another adventure.

\[In practice, Raggi was partially  right - the usual PC paranoia made sure that one PC insisted enough on  exploring the catacombs that they convinced the priest. Had I followed  the instructions to the letter, maybe the PC would have to choose  violence against the priest or simply leaving.\]

There is basically  one monster and LOTS of treasure. It is an interesting setup, and GREAT  for a change of pace. The monster is basically too strong for the PCs,  and the fact that there is only one main, unique antagonist makes it  feel ""special"".

**The goal of this module** is forcing the  players to think about encumbrance, movement, and mapping. The life of  the PCs depend on it. And there is more treasure and artifacts than the  PCs can carry, making these choices really meaningful. If you play this  module handwaving movement and encumbrance, you're missing half of the  point.

However, there are so much gold and magic items (and most  of them in a single location) that it makes them feel less special.  Also, most are cursed or dangerous, to the point of saturation.Books?  Some will kill will with no save, others will curse you, and one will  eventually destroy the universe. Scrolls will cause genocide across  Europe if sold to the highest bidder. or give you +1 attack bonus for  killing your parents. Magic weapon? Cursed. Statues? Cursed. Jewel?  Feeds on blood or maybe sucks you into the void if you try to take it. A  pile of excrement? Well, now *that* might be useful!

There are also ordinary potions and scrolls, and many items that the PCs will probably not be able to understand, carry or use.

In  short, unless you have an easy way of identifying magic items (e.g.,  ""make a spell saving throw"", etc.), you'll need another session after  the PCs have escaped to even start making sense of what they got. Or, if  the PCs are creative and want to test the items on the spot, they'll  probably pay dearly for it (and become discouraged *fast*).And then there is stuff like this:

>If at any point a character takes exactly 8points of damage (at once or cumulative,not 7 or less, not 9 or more, but at somepoint has taken exactly 8 points) while on the chariot, from any source, he dissipates into a whirlwind of sorrow and pain. Any player who laughs at this naturally withoutprompting can dictate the results of any one die throw in the future (do not reveal thisuntil the chariot stops). If it is the player whose character has disintegrated thatlaughs, he gets to determine the results of any two die throws in the future (includingduring new character creation).Any players caught laughing insincerely because they have read the adventure and wish to get the bonus must paint their nose yellow for the rest of the game session. If no yellow substance suitable for this purpose is available, one of that player’s character ability scores, selected at random, will be reduced to 3 until such time as the player completes an entire session with a yellow painted nose. Note this is a player-facing effect and new characters suffer this fate until the player complies.

I get that this is supposed to be humor... but it happens often, in random places, throughout the adventure.

**Anyway, the actual dungeon is really good.** It  gives you a labyrinthine feeling right away, with all its passages, ups  and downs, etc. Aside for a few situations where you just can't win  (best not to engage at all), most objects are interesting and provide  clues for the challenges ahead. The map is  decent (and good-looking) but I've found it hard to navigate due to the  (baffling) use of roman numerals and shades of blue and green that look  very similar on the screen (also, it is printed in black and white in  other parts of the book). There are enough stairs that will make you  flip back and forth constantly. Finding the way out took me a while. I  misunderstood one door to be barred from the wrong side, but that's  probably on me. 

In short: spend some time studying the maps before running this module.

**If you want to tone things down**,  you can change some of this stuff or allow some saving throws, or roll  to identify items... Alternatively, I think it would be fair to start  with a hook that allows the players that they are going into a place  full of stuff that might be better left buried, and that they must be  incredibly careful when interacting with it.

The art in this product (by Jason Rainville) is awesome and flavorful.

The  writing is good (if verbose), the backstory is great, and overall I'd  recommend checking this out if you want to play something different than  the usual stuff. I enjoyed running it and may even leave the players an  opportunity to go back (they escaped with lots of treasure, so I'm not  sure of what they're doing next).

**OVERVIEW** ([explanation here](http://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2021/02/so-reviews-and-mini-reviews-actual.html)):

**Usable**? Yes, with a bit of GM work it becomes a great adventure.

**Inspiring**? Definitely! Turns the idea of ""monsters in the dungeon"" on its head, it has great flavor and novelty.

**Bloated**?  A bit. You could cut the page count by half if you wanted something  more straightforward -although I'm sure there are people that enjoy the  absurdist humor, the crazy ideas, etc..

**Tiresome**? No, except, again, for the ""paint your nose yellow"" ideas.

**Clear**? Yes, except maybe for the map.

**In short**:  Awesome for a change of pace, requires some modification if you aren't  interested in giving PCs of levels 1-2 the opportunity to become  insanely rich, obtain legendary artifacts and potentially cause genocide  and world destruction... or if you don't want to tell the players to  put their character sheets in an envelope and leave in a public place  yadda yadda. Way more interesting than most ""vanilla"" adventures.",osr,1676036929.0,1,9060,1444

646,109,15c8k36,Just got my print copy of Basic Fantasy 4e - First thoughts,"This book comes in at 201 pages, a 25% increase from the 164 pages of the previous edition. It's not much, but it is enough to be noticeable.

This doesn't seem to come at the sacrifice of light rules. Mechanically, it's identical at first glance. Of the 37 new pages, 25 of them are in the Monsters section, which looks like the biggest area of change. A lot, maybe most of the new space in this edition is for new art, and that's especially true here. There's also some new monsters, like the barklings, a small, caninoid race, rival to kobolds. The new art is pretty hit-or-miss. Some, like the barkling and the kobold, are great, while other (unmentioned) pieces are much lower quality. IPersonally, I'm a little disappointed that there's now art for the triceratops and for the sabre-toothed cat. Not because they're bad pictures (they're not), but just simply because I doodled in my own images for them in the old edition. Actually, I think the new pictures look even better than mine, so there's that.

The monsters are reorganized, too, and I love what was done here. Dragons have been renamed based on their environment rather than color, while still keeping a reference to their traditional colors. Similarly, all of the classic slime-like monsters have been renamed and categorized as jellies. The traditional names for the various jellies still have entries, with reference markers pointing to the jelly category. *This is functional.* 

There is one significant issue with my copy of this book, though. I seem to have gotten a misprint. For some reason, this doesn't include the credits page, table of contents, or the page of artists' credits. I don't know what went wrong or where; it could be every copy, or it could just be my copy. It's kind of a glaring problem, though.

Overall, I like what I see. It's still Basic Fantasy, it's still old school, it's still good, and it's still cheap. If you're coming from the previous edition, it's still everything you know and love, just with a nice new paint job and a better license. If you're new to Basic Fantasy, it's still an easy entry for the game.",osr,1690576840.0,1,2116,369

[Doom of the Savage Kings (DCC #66.5)](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/129075/Dungeon-Crawl-Classics-665-Doom-of-the-Savage-King?affiliate_id=403100) is DCC adventure by Harley Stroh (if you don't know DCC, [read this](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2023/01/a-glance-at-basic-d-bx-and-some-clones.html)). Here is the blurb:

>**A Level 1 Adventure**High  above the windswept moors and darksome woods, the village of Hirot is  under siege. Each night, as the sun sinks beneath the western mountains  and the candles burn low, a devil-beast stalks the village streets,  unleashing its savage fury on the living. From warlord to pauper, crone  to child, no one is safe.Defeating  the immortal hound will require more than mere blades or even spells.  To slay the beast, the characters must delve into the mysteries of the  land and its Savage Kings. Only then, armed with relics forged from a  bloody past, can the most cunning and courageous of adventurers  challenge the hound of Hirot!

**Why did I buy/read this?** I find many DCC adventures interesting. So I've gathered some for my [current sandbox](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2022/10/sandbox-quest.html), including this one. I ran it using my [Dark Fantasy Basic](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/229046/Dark-Fantasy-Basic--Players-Guide), which required some mild adaptation.

This  DCC module is somewhat of a classic; I've heard people say good things  about it before, but I hadn't tried it. So I just inserted the village  of Hirot into my sandbox, a few rumors, and the PCs eventually went  there to investigate. 

My players are currently  in the third level. There were three of them, with three first level  hirelings. I changed some stats, but not much. So, while I felt that the  adventure looks hard for 3-4 1st level PCs, I cannot say for sure. This  is not meant as criticism, however; the adventure is fair, and players  with some experience will you avoid some of the worse traps in their way  (and, if they decide to take on a dozen enemies at once, they'll get  their fair ""reward""...).

This is a typical DCC  adventure: cool ideas, good maps, good art, some weirdness and humor. In  fact, it feels a bit less weird than some DCC adventures I ran before:  there's a village, and obvious threat, a small dungeon (in a  barrow-mound), a magic weapon, a witch...  It has a ""classic"" feel,   like a scene straight out of [Three Hearts and Three Lions](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2022/11/three-hearts-and-three-lions.html). 

Still,  the bits of weirdness are all interesting, creative and coherent: the  snake-ghouls, the demonic hound, the cursed swamp, and so on. This is  about the right balance between creativity and familiarity for me. 

As  for the adventure structure, it is the ""focused sandbox"" that is common  in modern adventures: the goal is more or less clear, but there are  multiple ways to get there (one of them being obviously more likely).  There are decent amounts of exploration, social interaction, and combat.  There are great creatures, NPCs and traps. There are enough places and  people in 20 pages to create multiple different situations, without ever  putting the PCs in a railroad. Likewise, the dungeon is not linear and  has multiple entrances.

(I must add that I  really like the format and contents of this dungeon - it is clever,  creative, coherent. I had some difficulties understanding the map for a  moment, but that might be just me).

Like most  DCC adventures, each monster and magic item is peculiar: there are no  goblins and skeletons in adjacent rooms, nor simple ""+1 spears"": things  always have a small distinction or two at the very least. Magic items  might be a bit too abundant for 1st-level adventurers, but this is a  dangerous adventure for them, so I think it's fair.

The  only baffling thing about the adventure is one particular scene that  takes less than one page: the PCs get ambushed for no apparent reason,  by NPCs they were, in theory, trying to help - and they also kill their  hirelings automatically, which feels like a cheap shot. A direct  confrontation in these circumstances felt harder than facing the hound  (in my game, the PCs managed to win due to being high level and a failed  morale check, but I don't know if this would be available with 1st  level PCs). It is unclear if there is room to negotiate avoiding  a  fight (the NPCs are willing to surrender), or if it would be possible to  still deal with the village after such a battle. In my games, the PCs  considered simply leaving after that, the village be damned, but  ultimately they decided to face the hound (I would have accepted any  decision, obviously).

I mention this not  because it detracts from the adventure - it doesn't - but only because I  think the DM should think about this specific scene before running the  module.

And, by the end, having a few loose threads might prove very useful for my sandbox...

Overall,  I found this to be an awesome adventure, above average even when  compared to other adventures I've picked because they were specifically  recommended.

**OVERVIEW** ([explanation here](http://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2021/02/so-reviews-and-mini-reviews-actual.html)):

**Usable**? Yes! This one is well organized and straightforward.

**Inspiring**? Yes! A bitt less weird than some DCC adventures.

**Bloated**? No. It has the right size.

**Tiresome**? Not at all.

**Clear**? Yes, mostly.

**In short**: As  you can see from the overview, this adventure succeeds in each of my  five criteria. This is probably a first here. DCC adventures are usually  good; this one has a bit more social interaction anb a bit less  weirdness than others. Because of that, it feels like a great adventure  to start a DCC campaign. Definitely **recommended**!",osr,1679578196.0,1,5991,912

687,216,105ol04,Death In Space player-sourced review,"I bought Death In Space a week ago and it finally arrived yesterday. I was so engaged I fell asleep reading about the star system it’s set in (that sounds like a diss but it’s not, I usually don’t read RPG books before bed these days).
First of all, I presented it to my players and they love everything about the book. They said a lot about the feeling of the setting- one guy said he really liked the way all the equipment, food, and expenses are located right on the inside cover, another guy said the same about the basic rules on the back inside cover. OSR folks really do not waste any part of the buffalo book.
What people in my group agree is the best are how quickly character creation can go with the random generator online. They also came to a consensus that the frailty of their characters is an excellent change of pace, especially coming from 5e where you often become a demigod at some point between level 14 and 20. 
Our first randgen had -1 BDY, -3 DEX, -3 SVY, and -2 TEC. We call him Fiddle Porter, The Boy Who Sucked (like really sucked). And best of all no one was angry; it was just the cosmic hand the player was dealt.
We’re going to play a session when we have time. People in my group absolutely love the premise and the vibe… and the very weak characters who will be dying in space a lot.",osr,1673096680.0,1,1316,253

689,225,vkgklk,Heroes of Adventure Player's Handbook is Out!,"Heya folks, wanted to drop a link here for the OSR game that I've been in love with for a while. 

TLDR: [Heroes of Adventure](https://nameless-designer.itch.io/heroes-of-adventure) by The u/Nameless-Designer is a, feature rich game with roots in early editions of D&D but with new school systems that feel as if they should have always been there. And it's free!

So, I found this a while back by happenstance as I sailed the Reddit seas, and I fell in love with it immediately. Being free is a big plus for me (though in all honesty I can't wait until I can throw money at the project), and as I began skimming the original document I started getting a feeling of nostalgia and excitement that other OSR games at the time just couldn't match. I gushed about it a bit, and another version was shortly uploaded, and while I didn't notice all the changes (as the game was very tight to begin with) I decided to go ahead and print a copy for myself through Lulu. And then I started playing. First a bit of solo using additional solo systems that I enjoy, and then with my home group. Coming from Worlds Without Number (which they loved) for a short game in Heroes of Adventure they were pleasantly surprised with how natural it felt , despite being distinct enough to set apart. One of my players, not really as much into the gaming scene (and not aware of things like OSR even), said at one point ""Man this feels really old school.""

Enough gushing (for now), what is the game like. Well, the new Player's Handbook has again stoked my nostalgia, and those in the know will understand why. The Red stylized cover and back cover and the 64 page count contains all the rules needed to run the game (though the actual rules of play are only 4 of that). All that is missing is a full bestiary (though there is a sample monster in the Sample Game section which shows how easy statting a monster is), treasure tables (though there are plenty of equipment tables and crafting and alchemy rules so as not to be needed for a while, and veteran GMs could likely come up with their own anyway), and wilderness and dungeon design (which I know is coming in the GM's guide, which I'm wondering if it will be a blue cover). With this book you could easily run a game from an existing dungeon, though veteran GMs will likely be able to make their own content easily.

Also of note however is that the the full rules (Heroes of Adventure - Rules v0.2) are still up on the page as well, and contain all the additional content not included in the PHB.

What about the system? Well it's d20 based, but uses a step die system to represent everything else (being Traits, Skills, and Knowledge) so that you don't actually roll a base attribute line. Instead, your Strength is a die that is determined by your Race and Class (you may not begin with Strength at all actually) and your experience and growth as you play. I love this. It is simple, modular, and the system allows for great customization and growth. How are these Traits etc. used? Pretty much as you have already guessed. Any test is a d20 + the relevant Trait/Skill/Knowledge. The game uses Advantage and Disadvantage unsurprisingly, which rerolls the whole check and not just the d20, and critical success (nat 20 or 10 over) and failure (nat 1 or 10 under) are here. A tight, simple, familiar system.

Then comes character design and subsystems. Characters are one of 4 familiar but new races (well, save the bog standard human), Classes (8) are each broken down into 4 Careers that affect character creation and style. And each Race and Class is showcased on a single page (and thus easy to print and hand out to the player) which I love. There is also a simple but detailed background generation system to add character depth.

Crafting and Alchemy shine in this game, and I won't try to explain it but encourage you to pick up the (again free) pdf, as these sections might be worth the price of admission alone for any OSR gamer.

And Magic. Wow the magic. Several domains, each containing many spells, and the cool thing is that if you know a domain you can cast every spell on the list, just at disadvantage (possible spell failure has consequences). You only gain proficiency (no disadvantage to cast) with certain number of spells. And guess what, **anyone** can cast spells from a prepared scroll, or try at any rate. And miracles are handled differently (and in a really interesting, probably the most interesting I've seen) way.

All in all you really need to give this a read. It's a wonderful, tight and deep OSR game that really feels lived in. It's concisely written, clear, intuitive for a veteran and simple for a new player, and as I said, free!

And hopefully in the next week or so I'll have some One Page Dungeons designed to use with Heroes of Adventure. Keep an eye out.",osr,1656168369.0,1,4834,871
690,227,mqs6tm,The Stygian Library - New vs Old Comparison & Review,"[Video Flipthrough](https://youtu.be/0fEEd022tm4)

**Comparison and Review: New vs Old - The Stygian Library**

*by PM Schramm*

The remaster.  The ultimate chance to fix past mistakes and relaunch a product with modern sensibilities while incorporating the lessons learned into a finished deliverable, all while being paid to do it.  It sounds like a dream come true, as long as your initial product drew enough interest that funding a remaster is feasible. *The Stygian Library* definitely fits this criteria.  The self-proclaimed “dungeon for bibliophiles” by Emmy Allen has been lauded since its launch for the creativity and unique location it brings to a tabletop game.  The highly variable tables within promise a unique experience every time it’s delved.

But, with a remaster comes certain expectations.  Improvements.  Simply rereleasing the same product already available can burn through goodwill extremely quickly, and being accused of making a “money grab” is a real possibility.  Thankfully, *The Stygian Library* doesn’t fall into this category.  The remaster is definitely an improvement over the original; however, does it do enough?  Let’s begin by examining its predecessor.

## Look, Feel, and Space Utilization

The original release of this random dungeon generator was available from DriveThruRPG and, as is usual from their print-on-demand products, the softcover end result isn’t anything to write home about.  The paper is thin, the printing is blurry, the binding is glued, and the interior covers are not printed.  Overall, as a beat-around copy you’d use at the table - which this product is really designed for - it’s passable.  I would not be uncomfortable writing my own notes and fixing the grammatical errors I found in the margins of this booklet.  Speaking of grammatical errors, looking at the rear cover gives you an idea of what can be expected within *The Stygian Library*, both from a content, and writing style point of view:

> *“Sufficient Knowledge twists the world around it into strange shapes. This, then, is the Stygian Library…a creepily genteel dungeon set in an infinite extradimensional library. Each expedition generates its route as it explores, resulting in new locations being is covered* [sic] *with every visit…It’s a big spooky library full of dangerous knowledge, spiritual automata and ghost-fuelled computers. Designed for low to mid power levels, and suitable for use with most old-school systems with a little adaptation.”*

The book mostly delivers on the promises found on the rear.  It has a middling layout with well-placed pictures and no text creeping from one page to the next.

## Content

Opening the work we find a title page, followed by a copyright page.  Next is an extremely busy table of contents that is hard to parse.  The only benefit to this page is that the tables are italicized, finding anything else at a glance is impossible.  Even the titles and page numbers sometimes take up two lines.  Following this is an introduction page that gives some insight into what inspired the module and what systems it was designed for/using.  From there, we dive into the meat of the adventure.  This begins with the rules on running it.

Located on page 7, this section really would benefit from a play example and referenced page numbers because, as written, it’s a bit confusing.  Things that are referenced haven’t been revealed to the reader yet and an introductory section that gives you insight into the library (for example, the “Events” section located on page 8) would have set the stage much better.  Overall, this book’s layout is out of order, and the excuse listed in the intro to “read the whole book cover to cover a few times” is a bit of a cop-out.  Continuing on, the rules for running blindly aren’t explained clearly.  When running, the referee is supposed to roll a 1d4-1 to determine how much deeper the party ends up, exploding and stepping up die sizes if a max value roll is the result.  But, no reference to a result of 0 is given, and staying on the same level of the library isn’t a real option based on the other rules.  My suggestion to those running the module would be to simply re-roll 1s to avoid 0s, but the author’s intent is unclear.

Perhaps these specific rules are buried in the prose somewhere, but finding them can be a bit of a challenge as, while no text carries from one page to the next, this is sometimes to the layout’s detriment, as displayed on page 11 in a wall of writing.  Even in black and white, there would have been some options to help distinguish important information to discern at a glance, but this opportunity wasn’t taken through much of the adventure, including shading alternating table entries like could have been leveraged on pages 14 and 15.

## Usability

The usability issues for *The Stygian Library* continue through much of the booklet.  For example, one glaring issue is seen at the bottom of every page.  The graphics are blurry.  This could just be an issue with DriveThru’s printer; however, in addition to the blurriness the font choice for the page numbers is extremely small and hard to read.  In a book you’re going to be using at the table, the ease of flipping around to find tables and other entries is a crucial piece of the puzzle that was overlooked.  Granted, when flipping through, your brain has the tendency to fill in the gaps for numbers you can't actually read, but I’m fairly confident more than a few people will have an issue locating things with the page number graphics selected.

Another issue is shown next in the locations: the order they’re listed in appears to be the order they were written in, rather than in an alphabetical or logical order.  This makes it impossible to find something without looking it up first on page 13.  Better yet, the locations should be numbered, which would allow a clever referee to forgo looking up anything at all on the Locations table, as they could simply roll the die and find the result within the book if they so choose.

Rounding out the remainder of the booklet there are a few more grammatical and usability errors, for example the fact that throughout the text sometimes the page numbers for certain Librarians are listed, and sometimes they are not.  You may ask, “What are Librarians?”  The answer is they’re an important part to this dungeon as they make the whole thing work.  They’re listed at the rear of the module, in the bestiary section, far later than when it would have been preferred to learn about them.  It’s only one page, moving it to the beginning, near the intro, would have been a good design choice.

# The Remaster

There are more than a few areas that could have used improvement in the original *Stygian Library* - let’s look at the new release.  The first thing that’s immediately apparent is a drastic improvement in printing quality moving away from DriveThruRPG.  In addition, moving to an offset also grants the ability to leverage the interior covers for the printing of the tables used most often, a great advantage to a procedurally-generated dungeon!  Unfortunately, Allen opted not to use the interior covers for this purpose, but to instead display very basic artwork.  The reason why this decision was made is unclear.  The remaster has no additional functionality improvements in its form compared to its predecessor outside of a ribbon bookmark.  That’s a huge missed opportunity in this reviewer’s eyes.  At least the rear cover is now clear of grammatical errors.

Opening the adventure reveals a title page, a vastly improved table of contents, and then the introductory section. This is where the first differences in the interior text are noted. While the majority of the text and writing is the same, the references to *Lamentations of the Flame Princess* and *Swords & Wizardry* as particular systems used in the testing and writing of the module are now excluded, keeping instead the simple statement, “This was written & tested using a weird mishmash of OSR systems.” In addition, the mention of *A Red and Pleasant Land* by Zak S. was excluded from the section where the book’s inspiration is listed.

There are a few other changes here and there, some of which involves the addition of typos such as the space between “Somebody must have died there” and its period on page 9, but overall the format is much better and much less wall-of-textish.  Another example showing improvement is the cleanliness of the “How to Run” section on page 10.  The use of fonts and bolding is effective, something the previous iteration of this module did not leverage; that said, the time to revise the rules to provide clarity - specifically on the “Running Blindly” section previously noted - was disappointingly not taken.

This is the net result and my main gripe of the remaster.  Most of the writing and information is exactly the same with only a few slight tweaks and a better, but not great, layout.  For example, migrating the Librarians to the front wasn’t done because that’s how the original was laid out and the remaster doesn’t deviate a lot from its previous incarnation.  Even though the Librarians are so important and it makes much more sense to put them directly after the section they’re first mentioned in on page 18, they’re still near the end of the book on pages 112-115.  A remaster is supposed to be a reimagining of your previous work, a chance to fix and shore up the areas that needed improvement.  *The Stygian Library* didn’t take this opportunity.

All the included tables are the same compared to their previous versions, excluding the removal of the “don’t add depth” rule from the original encounter tables.  This is either something that was supposed to be added and simply wasn’t or was the only rules change included in the remaster.  This author’s guess is the former, especially considering the error for results >20 on the dreams and rumors tables on pages 132 and 142, but as-is it’s not necessarily a negative.  The change makes multiple re-rolls possible and boosts the average result higher.  The tables look much better, but once again the results don’t have their numbers listed on their respective pages.  At least they’re alphabetized this time, which makes it a bit easier to navigate, but *why aren’t these tables on the interior covers?*

More slight issues abound: the b on *B****one Beast*** on page 49 is missing its bolding and the events table on page 24 should have when to roll a d20 vs a d12 listed here, rather than on page 13 where it could be missed. The encounter tables on the subsequent pages include clarifications, there should be some here too.

## Conclusion

Overall, *The Stygian Library* remaster is, to put it simply, a missed opportunity.  The original needed more than just a fresh coat of paint.  It had some issues and errors that should have been addressed that weren’t, and the new format added issues that should have been caught in the editing stage.  Some of these errors are downright lazy, epitomized by the error on page 139. “I Search the Body” result #28: Book (Roll on the Types of Books Table [ppxx]).  Simply Ctrl+Fing for the obvious placeholder text [ppxx] during the layout stage or in the completed pdf before sending the book off to print would have caught this blunder, but no one thought to do it.

If you don’t own this adventure yet you want the remaster.  If you own the original is it worth it to buy the new one?  You make that call.  It certainly does look better sitting on your shelf.

695,243,10r3aj9,Interview with watt designer of Cloud Empress,"I'm so grateful I had the opportunity to do this interview with **watt**. We talked about the genesis and some game design choices behind Cloud Empress a science fantasy campaign setting for Mothership.

This is the River Prince’s song, and it is all around you.*

*Everyone has a story to tell along the Riverlands. Rafts carrying goods to the far-off cities to the south bring news from the mountains from which the rivers are born. Merchants venture from the cities seen in the far distance to ply their trades along the docks as pontoon boats make landfall at sunset. Children scream in peals of laughter that echo through the deep valleys  as they run through the long grass. This is the River Prince’s song, and it is all around you.*

*Here too there is mystery, love, and danger. A cloaked man passes a note to a boat captain, ordering the assassination of a merchant in the city of Estuary. A young woman swims across the river to meet in secret with her lover on the other side, against her mothers’ wishes. A barge catches fire just as it turns a corner, entering a dock-filled village, putting the whole settlement in danger. This, too, is the River Prince’s song. It is all around you.*

*What will your story be? What song will the River Prince sing for you?*

Song of the River Prince is a self-contained roleplaying game built on a streamlined, intuitive system that lets you begin playing within minutes. It includes dedicated rules for navigating the rivers and streams of the Riverlands, introducing dynamic twists and obstacles along your journey. Detailed downtime mechanics invite you to explore each settlement’s activities and culture, encouraging meaningful interactions between adventures. The book showcases six distinct towns scattered across the Riverlands—each with its own festivals, seasonal weather patterns, and vibrant communities—alongside random tables for shaping your travels, compelling adventure hooks, memorable NPCs, unique wildlife, and tantalizing rumors to uncover.

I have been tossing around an idea for a campaign of a non-magic world where a meteor strikes and the fragments of that meteor can be the fuel for magic/alchemy/magic items. The world would be, technology-wise, at the usual place most fantasy settings are, sans magic. Bows and arrows, swords and armor, etc.

The plan would be that the players are prisoners who are being sent to explore the land where the meteor hit under the watchful eyes of their captors. But their ship is attacked and wrecked by an ""impossible"" creature. i.e. fantastic. and they manage to survive and make it to the island.

I want a system that relies on skills, has the capability of magic but can be without it. A great crafting system would also be good as I am envisioning this as a survival game to start but eventually the players grow enough in power to rise up against their captors.

Please let me hear your advice for a system(s) or if you need more details from me.

Jimmi here from [Domain of Many Things](https://www.domainofmanythings.com/) serving up my weekly ponderings, for your consumption and pleasure 😁 This week - getting new players into the OSR.

In my experience, old-school play thrives on danger ☠️ but I've found a real issue persuading people who've joined the hobby via 5e and stayed there to try it out, because they feel like their characters are doomed from the start, and won't have satisfying stories to tell.

**Fair play to them if they really don't want to explore the wider TTRPG hobby, but there's a whole other world outside that gated 5e garden, just waiting for em.**

A good OSR game can be brutal for sure, but it should also be fun, engaging, and give players a fighting chance - if they're smart.

In my latest bloggadowndiddlydoo, I dig into what makes OSR challenges feel *fair* rather than frustrating  (and also use faaaar too many Matt Mercer gifs). I'm talking about empowering players to balance risk, giving them real choices, and making sure every death tells a story rather than just feeling like a dice-flavored slap in the chops.

Any time I talk about trying to help DMs I'm playing with or players I'm trying to recruit for a non-5e game or otherwise, it sounds like I'm gloating. Stuff like;

'Hey, you don't need to hack 5e to play a superhero game. Would you like to look at a couple superhero rpgs I have?'

I want a game (ideally medieval fantasy adjacent, but anything goes) that does the following:

1. Has some kind of grid or mini based combat
2. Is more narrative friendly than 5e/Pathfinder and rewards more RP or Exploration etc...
2. Combat is less grindy/difficult than 5e (Not necessarily rules light but ideally avoiding 2-3 hour long combats)
3. Lends itself to cool narrative moments, flavorful actions, mechanics related to non-combat stuff (xp for traveling or RP encounters, etc...)
4. Is NOT player facing. Don't know if that's the correct term, but whenever I've seen someone ask about a more ""narrative"" game everyone recommends PbtA games, which is decidedly not what I want. I want an experience that still has that GM / Player divide, where the GM sets the story and players don't have to improv scenes or new characters into the world on the fly

Overall I really like the _Idea_ of PbtA but every one of those RPGs lose me when the players have to come up with characters, scenes, etc... on the fly, that is very much not what my group and I want, we still want a similar experience to DnD where the GM narrates almost everything, the players only really have agency over their own actions not the world itself.

Games that have called my attention so far based on that is stuff like Dragonbane, Tales from the Loop, Draw Steel (MCDM RPG), Pendragon, and Daggerheart.

the idea comes from some of the many MMORPG type light novels that are all over the place. i love mastery systems where using a skill more makes it more powerful. my thought was to sort of reverse it though so failing the roll will earn the experience as you learn more from failure.

the idea in my head is kind of a kitchen sink type system. i want to emulate/model/make abilities based on all kinds of things: devil fruit powers from one piece, zanpaktou from bleach, naruto ninja abilities, to mistborn powers from brandon sanderson, to world of warcraft abilities. like, they wouldnt start as powerful as the source material, but you can train them up and invest in them to make them more powerful. other inspirations for abilities: death mage who doesnt want a 4th time, overgeared, the beginning after the end, reincarnated with the strongest system (a bunch of isekai and regressor trash that i absolutely adore, especially if it gives MC a stat screen)

the reason i started to doubt GURPS was because i kept reading things about how it starts to break down the further from grounded realism you get, and this crazy idea of mine wouldnt stay there very long...

719,25,1jepxdg,Running a (AD&D)spelljammer-esque game in a modern system?,"Hey folks,

A few months ago I got into Troika!. It's a fun system, very lightweight OSR thingy (my first contact with OSR actually, so a nice way to get into it), and the ""making the lore up as you go"" philosophy along with the strong weird science-fantasy vibe made the game feel really unique to play.

Troika has no official lore, only snippets you and your table glue together as you go. Over time, the snippets combined into a campaign pitch: The players have an aether-faring vessel, but are stuck in a region of space because of a powerful space dragon (details To Be Worked On™). I then read a good chunk of the AD&D spelljammer books for inspiration, and yeah, that is really the vibe I'm going for.

Now, my problem is that I am no longer sure I want to do that campaign in Troika. I envision a game with a little bit of a heroic/epic feel (alongside the usual comedy that so many games usually devolve into) that I am not 100% sure Troika is suited for. My two gripes are a) I still have trouble running OSR games, they are not intuitive to me eg. I am afraid to kill player characters and I don't know how much/if I should help them for numerical progress; and b) Troika is designed with very simple, chaotic combat in mind, whereas I actually enjoy a bit more tactics. If I do run it in Troika, It's likely I will stitch together a simple ship tactical combat system from old spelljammer stuff and some troika community resources, but I don't know if I should also want more tactical combat for player combats.

So I guess my question is, do you think Troika is a system suited for that sort of stuff? If so, How do I handle longer campaigns in OSR-style games, where death is supposedly always on the table, but characters are still supposed to progress? And if not, what system would be better suited for that sort of campaign? (I prefer avoiding D&D 5e, as I am not a big fan of the system)",rpg,1742362118.0,0,1907,357

721,27,1jeoqf5,I just can’t get into Shadowdark or OSR style games no matter how much I’ve tried.  Am I alone?,"I have been playing “D&D” since the early 80s. I had the red box, the wax pencil for my dice, the whole experience. I know I never really played by the rules because I was 10 or 11 when I started, but I didn’t care. It was awesome. I got into MSH/Faserip, Star Frontiers, and more. I played solo before it was cool. As the decades passed I played each new addition of D&D and since TTRPGs have exploded in popularity I have Kickstarted and picked up TONS of indie and third party games. 

Unlike many I actually liked 4e but hated the massive power bloat and sky high ACs and HP. 5e was a nice compromise of crunch and simplicity. Still, I was always searching for something else. 

Index Card RPG was a revelation for me. It opened my eyes two ways of playing Dungeons & Dragons that I hadn’t thought of. Basically it was permission to change the rules and make the game easier and faster which I was a fan of. It also made me search out some old school style games. I tried OSE but remembered I hated THAC0. Old Swords Reign was fine. I checked out Castles and Crusades and more. So when I heard about Shadowdark, which was heavily influenced by ICRPG’s creator, I jumped right in.

I KS’d the whole package, all the zines and the DM screen. I was excited about a faster and easier version of “D&D”. The enthusiasm faded as I looked at the classes and options and found them to be very bland and boring. The fact that mechanically you can’t make a fighter much different from every other fighter in the world was annoying. I wanted low HP I wanted fast combat but I also wanted to play an actual hero not a barely competent villager for three or four levels. The game is well-made for certain and seems to be well-loved, but I just cannot get excited to play the PCs. I REALLY wanted to like it but I’ve had the books for years now, I’ve made a few PCs, watched a hundred videos about how great it is and I still can’t get it to the table. 

I’m frustrated and curious if anyone else has gone though this same experience? I keep going back to 5E with some homebrew. But every few weeks I stare at my Shadowdark stuff, wishing it had more to offer. Wondering what I’m not getting. I played old school D&D and I guess my tastes and preferences have grown up? I am not a min max’er at all, but I guess want neat things my PC gets to do. I don’t want to run from Goblins for 2-3 levels, I want to be a hero. Not a superhero, but someone that can do cool stuff. I feel like there just aren’t a lot of games in the gap between OSR and 5e/PF2e. I have ZERO desire to play past 7th-10th level in any RPG, but I want to enjoy 1st-3rd. 

EDIT: almost everyone’s been really cool in their replies, but I wanna make clear. I don’t think Shadowdark a bad game, at all. I appreciate the kind words because seriously I’ve gotten emotional and frustrated over this and just needed to share!

The TLDR is I really wanted to like it and I still wish I could get into it but I feel like I’ve changed too much over the years and I don’t wanna play that kind of game anymore and I’m bummed because it seems like I should like it and I’ve spent a lot of money on it.",rpg,1742357466.0,0,3146,610

733,39,1jegq6z,Invincible or Superhero TTRPG,"So im making a session for this weekend, only its set in the world of Invincible. I want to use as many of the classic D&D rules as I possibly can just so that we don't have to spend a ton of time being confused learning new mechanics. My thought was to keep pretty much everything the same in regards to role-playing and travel and what not. The only thing I'm a little confused on is how I'm going to tackle the class system.
My thought was to make my own small set of classes, obviously superhero power based, and then make my own 2 to 3 sub classes inside of that class very similar to DND, but with my own rules and stuff. To make things even more unique, every few levels I will let them choose from a list of unique powers that only their hero has, and once they make that choice, that power every few levels as I said, will unlock more abilities. Does this sound fairly simple but doable?

As you may know, invincible is very fast paced, and very violent, so I was also seeking advice on how you would operate with combat, I plan on doing it pretty much the same way, but some characters are gonna be flying a lot and they have very high speed attacks, and some characters are obviously gonna have to have very powerful unarmed strikes and that kind of thing. But what else might you do to alter it? Again, I wanna keep it as close as possible while also bringing that fast pace, violent superhero fun. This is gonna be a trial run so if something doesn't work, we can always adapt, but like I said, I'm really just making my own sub classes and classes and I'm gonna have to put some work into Creating my own abilities for them. Any advice would be super awesome

EDIT, if a new games systems would benefit me more, which would be the easiest to understand or closest to DND? I feel like its really just making my own classes and combat that would need to be overhauled ",rpg,1742333958.0,0,1880,360

For those unfamiliar with the Tales of the Ketty Jay book, it could be equated to Firefly except they stay on one planet.  

* Technology levels are early 1900s with airships, fighters and various other modes of transportation and airship/vehicular combat is a big thing with ship roles.
* Combat is largely martial with firearms and melee
* Magic is handled through thralling daemons to enchant things rather than directly channeling any magic, but the setting is generally low magic.

A stand can be built by taking an Edge (X dots = X Paths), selecting its paths and then building it with the dots of the Major path and the other minor ones.

The stand gimmick can be easily made with Aberrant rules for Quantum Powers or The world Below rules for Wild Kaos.

Each path of the Stand gives dots, but you can't have new paths unless you create an ACT Stand.

If the Stand has more than 5 dots on the attribute, then make it an advantage like Mega-Edges/Mega-Attributes.

746,52,1je690l,Fleshing out the concept of a druidic crime syndicate in a big city,"I have been fascinated by the idea of a druidic crime syndicate in a big city. The concept of urban druids has existed since *D&D* 3.5, and for all I know, they may have appeared even earlier than that.

Animals receive plenty of leeway in a metropolis: all the cats on the rooftops, the birds on the windowsills, the dogs wandering the slums or being walked around by the two-legs. Assuming a generic fantasy city (as opposed to, say, an arcology-city with mile-high towers, like Sharn), horses draw the wagons of the poor and the carriages of the wealthy. Then there are the ""undesirables,"" such as rodents and arthropodal pests.

Someone who can talk to such creatures has many sources of intel and blackmail. Someone who can transform into beasts has myriad avenues of infiltration, burglary, espionage, and assassination; imagine a druid posing as a pet. A homeless druid can simply sleep as a cat, a bird, or some other innocuous animal. Of course, there cannot be too many criminal druids in the city, or else people would get paranoid around animals.

A little higher up in the druidic power scale, and we have plant-speakers. Cities have flora, too. Most people scoff at the idea that a flower pot on a windowsill, or a tree just outside of the window, could be turned into a spy against them.

How do you think such a druidic crime syndicate would have started in the first place? How would they reconcile druidism with being a criminal syndicate in a big, bustling city? The whole ""urban jungle is an ecosystem"" metaphor can be stretched only so far.",rpg,1742308095.0,0,1561,273

What made Microscope so great was that it was genre-agnostic. A lot of the ones I've found through searches don't fit the bill.

I love my partner, very much. He's been working on a game for several years, after taking a break for 5 years, and has a cool concept and setting. (At least, I think so.) Thing is, he's changed the system several times.  Just recently,  we had a session 0, where we worked through making characters. And he realized,  it was too much...

Some background:

He's played TTRPGs for... 40 years (starting as a kid), never really played D&D.  He's played GURPS, Rolemaster, Hero, those type games. He was also a GM for many years, so it's not like he's new to this.  He likes D100 and Skill based systems.

I've been playing TTRPGs for 25 years (started in my 20s), and have played D&D (AD&D 2nd, 3.5, and 5) as well as Pathfinder (1st).  I've never played any of the super crunchy stuff.

We have a 3 other players who have played D&D for years, and one who has never played anything,  but has been around D&D before. 

So, a total of 5 players.

I'm happy to learn a new game, and now own several, shiny new hardcover books. But I need him to pick something!!  

Here is what hasn't made the cut: Runequest, Against The Dark Master, Mythras, anything Modiphius (I played 2 game sessions of the Dune game, and HATED it), and just recently Harnmaster. I know there are others...

He has commented on how a Universal System might be cool.

He recently looked at Barabrians of Lemuria

Now, we are watching YouTube Videos on Savage Worlds (something he has, in the past, rejected).

...

TLDR:
So, my fellow TTRPG people, here is my ask.  

I need a system that is:
1. Skill based
2. D100 (roll over or under)
3. Universal 
4. Only slightly crunchy 
5. Easy to learn
6. Happy to support small businesses and independent Creators.

>Originally OpenD6 was published by West End Games. It has changed hands a few times over the years until eventually being digitally published for free. OpenD6 is a universal system with three independent Core Rulebooks. They are ""D6 Fantasy"", ""D6 Adventure"", and ""D6 Space"". Each contains all of the rules and systems you need to play in a variety of settings and you can even mix and match elements to create your own genre mashups. The system is easy to learn and play, using only common six-sided dice. Each of the D6 books also comes with a great introductory section with a choose-your-own-style solo adventure, designed to teach a new player how to play OpenD6 and RPGs in general.

>OpenD6 was also simplified into a lighter weight and easier to consume, and still free, version named MiniSix. MiniSix breaks the rules down into roughly 11 pages, with the remaining 30 pages containing sample characters and settings as well as a guide for using OpenD6 content with the simpler set of rules.

In particular, I've been thinking about how NPC interactions might differ. In my linear campaigns, I feel that NPCs are often only there for a single scene while the players get what they need out of them. A loop would let players probe the NPC with different approaches, or see how they act when the players leave them alone.

I've only run a time loop once, as an improv one shot. I'm curious if anyone knows of premade one shots that do it well. Even more curious if there's a whole premade campaign structured around this, as I'm very curious to see how it's organized and what level of depth is provided. E.g. how do you present prep that has meaningful opportunities for causality while still being open to player choice.

The thing I'm most curious about is: has anyone designed a system that's purpose-built for running time loops? Because I feel like a lot of player progression and GM prep decisions would be warped by the time loop structure.

I've been playing TTRPGs for about 4 years now. I started with D&D, but often felt limited as a player and confused as a GM. I found a group of people who played non-D&D TTRPGs which allowed me to explore other systems.

779,86,1jdi7vn,Looking for advice on switching systems.,"
My Lancer group has recently decided they don't actually enjoy the mech combat as much as the narrative.
Unfortunately the narrative system suffers from the game design expectation that it would only be about 10% of the total gameplay, meaning it is a bit too skeletal for me to enjoy running a whole campaign in it.

SO
I'm looking into new systems to shift over to. 
I want to go with something Powered by the Apocalypse, but I haven't found  anything that is quite exactly fitting for the setting and story we're currently telling. I know that is frequently a bigger problem in PBTA systems than in ones where the mechanics are less dependent on the fiction, But the system that the players have been using is essentially a barebones PBTA system so I want to stick with that feel. 

The basic pitch and story so far is that they were all inhabitants of a remote mining village that happened to be Too Close to the Plot™️ 
Now they have been dragged into the resistance struggle of a planet currently besieged by two different galactic colonial factions after having just thrown off the yoke of a local tyrant that had been backed by one of those factions. Meanwhile the weapons of the oppressors (orbital ring, murderous AI(shackled space gods?)s, automated defense networks) are all going haywire as some Ancient Thing™️ is awakening in the planet's core.

I'm drawn to Impulse Drive and Uncharted Worlds, but there are definite obvious drawbacks to both of those given the need to translate existing characters and the setting and theme I currently have.

The law’s everywhere, railroads cuttin’ through the land like a knife, telegraphs carryin’ words faster than a horse ever could. Even the outlaws got nowhere left to run... Pinkertons will find you fore you can even spit.*

*Dogtown? Hell, that place’s been dead longer than most men been alive. Aint a soul left but the ones too stubborn or too crazy to leave. The wild’s takin’ it back, stone by stone. And whatever’s left out there… well, it ain’t meant to be found.*

*But see, folks ain’t satisfied with just the here and now. Ever since them damn Fox sisters started knockin on tables, folks been whisperin to ghosts, scribblin symbols in the dirt, thinkin they can talk to whatevers on the other side. Ain’t just fortune-tellers and city folk no more... out in places like Dogtown, the ones left behind get to thinkin’ maybe they can call somethin’ back, somethin’ older than dust, older than God.*

*They say the last folk livin out there were talkin’ to spirits carvin  strange words into rock, beggin’ for answers. But you ask me? Some questions don’t need answerin. Some doors, once opened, don’t close easy. And if you listen close at night, past the wind and the trees, you might just hear what came through.*

*I heard the last people that went there didn’t return … at least they didnt come back the same… ""*

This intro is kinda detached from adventure and just an intro to get them in the mood.  
  
The idea is that they will awaken and don't really know who they are around a table in a city left behind. Its gonna be based on the real town of [Dogtown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogtown,_Massachusetts), Massachusetts and Ill even include some real people from there.  
They will be five people who were out of luck and made a deal with something darker. They made to be sent into the future to a time when Dogtown was doing better. Little did they know it would only go south. There is basicly no longer anyone that lives in Dogtown. Just outside lives Thomasine “Tammy” Younger, Queen of the Witches. She was the one who helped them with the ritual. How she is still alive is one mystery.

My idea is that they will be trapped in Cape Ann. (I have a lot of history and lore about this kinda stuff that I can share if anyone cares to know) and the point of the  adventure is for them to discover the story of Dogtown both as players and characters and be scared. Witches, wild dogs and this old being(I think I will call it The Quiet Harvest) will all have affected the land. 

My Problem: How will I end this? Do I just put a timer on them, if they dont find a way out or manage to redo the ritual they die? Or how would I end this?  
What is their goal? Do they just have to survive 24 hours because the being they made the deal with only awakens that day(Blood Moon? Planets aligned? Midsummer? that kinda thing?) and if they survive they can leave Dogtown?

These notes are written from the perspective of being a GM that wants great gaming experiences to happen for the widest variety of players. These ideas are not my own, but a compilation of helpful, and what I assume are widely applicable tips that I have learned over the years, but put into my own words, and that became proverbial to me during my journey to become a better GM.  
And so without further delay I present 11 GM tips to make games awesome!

1. **Make the players’ choices matter**
2. **Set clear expectations**
3. **Don’t plan, just prep**
4. **Use the rules as tools for fun**
5. **Consume media** 
6. **Use your own words**
7. **Show, don’t tell**
8. **Allow the players to succeed**
9. **Fail forward**
10. **Leave your ego at the door**
11. **Prioritize fun**

These tenets can be taken at face value, and can have multiple interpretations. I explain them in further detail ahead, as I understand them, and how I would hope to implement them in the games that I run. These notes make the assumption that the reader has some experience as a GM, but could still be helpful for new GMs. The approaches discussed here promote flexible thinking, strengthening your improvisational skills, and nurturing your imagination, as well as cutting back on time-wasting practices and identifying and strengthening the vital aspects of your game.

**‘1. Make the players’ choices matter’**  
First and foremost, player agency is everything. If you give the players the freedom they desire, they will be more likely to engage with the elements of the adventure you have provided. If the players feel like their choices matter, they will respect your adventure and want to invest in it. The story emerges from the conversations between the GM and players, don’t fight it! The players are part of the world and in control of their destiny. Never tell the players how their characters feel or how they act. It's okay to point the players in a particular direction or even be explicit about what the players should be trying to accomplish, just don’t have precise expectations about *how* the players should approach accomplishing those goals. Requiring the players’ to take specific actions to succeed is called ‘railroading,’ and it should be strictly avoided.  
To do this effectively, you should be trying to create problems, not solutions, and let the players handle those problems however they want. Do not force the game through a pinhole where there is only one way to ‘win’ the adventure or ‘beat’ an encounter; how things resolve should remain flexible or better yet, open ended. Not expecting what the players are going to do is part of the fun. Whether the players succeed or fail at their goals, they’ll prefer to have done it their way.  
You want to incentivise players to engage with the fiction by using rewards like information and treasure, but most of all, agency in the story’s outcomes. Always ask the players questions-- what are you doing? what do you hope will happen? As much as the structure of your adventure will allow, let the players wander, and decide for themselves what to interact with, and what is meaningful to pursue as they stumble across your adventure hooks.  
During play, let players explore their character’s uniqueness and be good at the things they chose during character creation. One easy way to demonstrate that you care about the players’ choices is to always refer to the players by their characters’ names, not the players’ actual names, during play, while building or adpating your adventure hooks to better fit, or to include aspects of a PC's backstory, will really go far in telling your players that you are invested in their participation. But mostly, you should just be interested in hearing the things the players want to tell you or ask you about their characters.  
Respect the players’ character creation autonomy within reason and be upfront about any restrictions you might have on players’ options beforehand.

**‘2. Set clear expectations’**  
Often done during a ‘zero session,’ where the GM and players meet up before the official start of the adventure and discuss the upcoming game. It's important that players know things about the game they will be playing, such as the system, genre, setting, etc... as well as working out a schedule together and communicating how long you anticipate the game will take.  
Let the players know how much prep they will need to do, and what your vision for the adventure is, as well as what playstyles are suitable for the game you plan to run. At this point it is important to establish safety tools and be clear about any controversial themes you might be planning to include. Every table is different, which stresses the importance of having these discussions beforehand.  
One way to approach this during the zero session is to decide on ‘lines and veils.’ A topic that is a ‘line’ means it absolutely never comes up during the game, meanwhile a topic that is a ‘veil’ is only vaguely hinted at during the game, remains undescribed, or is avoided by doing a ‘fade to black’ scene cut. Also make it clear to the players that if something happens during the game that bothers them, they should feel comfortable bringing it up, either during or after the game, and that they can either do this with the GM privately, or discuss it openly at the table.  
Be open minded about what your players require to feel comfortable.  
It helps for everyone to know each other too, so if you’re playing with new people, this adds to the importance of meeting up beforehand.  
Zero sessions have become commonplace and it's reasonable for players to expect to begin this way. It pays to prepare a list of talking points heading into your group's zero session, and be ready to take notes. Some campaigns aim to be so robust that multiple zero sessions may be necessary, while other games may only require an email or short conversation beforehand. In any case it never helps to skip out on, or rush through this very important step.

**‘3. Don’t plan, just prep’**  
GMing can be hard work, but we often make it much harder than it needs to be. Over-preparing can be exhausting and harm your game. Always closely study the adventure materials when preparing for a game, but then just create simple notes for reference during the game, and try to rely on your memory and imagination as best you can. You want to be able to react to the players with little hesitation, and having to constantly reference your notes can lose your players attention.  
Favor spontaneity. You want to be prepared for what might happen, not plan what will happen. Don’t log every detail of a map or scene, leave some things blank so that there can be room for improvisation or changes during gameplay. Being able to move pieces around behind the scene during play is a powerful tool. You should set things up in a way that allows you to be flexible about where the players can obtain important information. Where paths lead and what NPCs know only becomes established in the fiction once it is learned by the players during play; you’re allowed to change anything you want right up until you reveal it. Being flexible will pay off because you will be able to allow the narrative to develop naturally, based around the actions the players have taken, and that will become super food for player engagement. Also, roll tables are your friend, embracing that kind of randomness can breathe life into your routine.  
Colorful, elaborate maps and detailed miniatures(or tokens if using a VTT) work great to get players instantly immersed, and it's rewarding to see the players eyes light up upon seeing a marvelous set piece for the first time. But high-level presentation is not necessary for a lot of games, or even recommended. Becoming skilled at using a 'theater of the mind' approach(no maps or minis) is great for narrative freedom and fast gameplay. Using a mixture of theater of the mind and visual tools will give you the flexibility to connect your important encounters together with improvised scenes. Being able to abstract characters, monsters, and objects using plain tokens, and simple maps drawn on the fly using dry erase battle mats, will give you the freedom to be spontaneous and makes for easier prep too. There is no one way to prepare for a game that is better than another, but no matter what approach you take, it shouldn't harm your health or your budget, and should help you maintain the best possible game/life balance

**‘4. Use the rules as tools for fun’**  
Rules should be a conduit for the game to happen smoothly, and not get in the way of the fun. Some games have complex rules while others do not, but no matter which, if a rule feels illogical in the way it inhibits a player’s ability to interact with the fiction, bend that rule to make it work if it would result in smoother gameplay. And if there doesn’t seem to be a rule about a certain action a player wants to make, that doesn’t necessarily mean they can’t do it, that just means it's up to the GM to decide if it makes sense that their character could do that, and if so, what happens as a result. That could mean inventing a whole new rule on the spot; though it's probably best to try and shoehorn the undefined action into an existing rule, or something that works similarly. If you make a new mechanic, model it after ones in the system you're playing as best you can.  
As the GM, it is important that you try to be as well versed in the rules of the game you are running as you can, but this responsibility extends to the players as well, who should care about knowing and respecting the rules. Nobody needs to be a rules-cyclopedia to have fun playing a game, if anything, being too consumed with the minutiae can lead to pedantic and boring gameplay. Try to strike a balance between being faithful to the game’s design and your own personal style.  
Some players enjoy using rules to optimize their character’s abilities; this is okay but it should never be done to overshadow the other players or to ‘hack’ the game. In the worst case scenario of a character feature that is breaking the game, and you have to make an adjustment to balance things, be honest with the players about why you think this is needed, and understanding about why it may interfere with a player’s vision for their character. Tread lightly when changing rules to curb power levels, and maintain precedent as best you can when you have to make a ruling on something that isn’t clear per the game's instructions.  
If a disagreement about a rule or ruling comes up at the table, hear the players out and be fair, but remember that GMs should have the final say on how the rules work- this is often called ‘rule zero.’  
And try your best to choose a game system that best supports the kind of play experience you’re after. Don’t be afraid to leave the D&D sphere, it is a great game, but isn’t the best game for every play style or genre.

**‘5. Consume media’**  
Take inspiration from all your favorite things and don’t be afraid to steal ideas. Read books, watch television and movies, etc… Mix and match elements from all those things. Even if the players notice you’ve taken something from somewhere, they should still enjoy it. Some themes just remain timeless, so the more you know about fantasy and adjacent genres the better. If you aren’t planning to publish your adventure, then there isn’t any need to worry about plagiarism, unless your ideas are so derivative that it interferes with your game's ability to become immersive.  
Be tuned in to the world around you, invest in publications that enhance the games you love, and be on top of trends in gaming culture. Find the influencers in the RPG space that you like and watch their videos online, listen to their podcasts, follow them on social media, but try to diversify your consumption of media.  
Creating your own setting is fun, and for some, the most attractive part of GMing. The media you consume will inform your worldbuilding, so having varied sources to draw from will enrich your homebrew settings. Worldbuilding is a big part of TTRPGs, but it will take more time to immerse your players in a world that's unique to your own mind, while using a known setting, like one associated with a specific piece of media, can quickly put the players and GM on the same page. Another approach is to keep the setting ambiguous. This way, the larger world remains undefined, but based around our assumptions of what is found in a setting of that type, where small deviations from those big tropes will stand out more. Don’t log every detail, filling the blanks with improvisation when needed.  
It can even be fun to hand some of the world building duty over to the players too; for example, when a fictional location is introduced into the game, ask one or more of them why they have been to this place before and one fact they know about it. Or ask the players to describe an odd feature they notice about a creature they encounter or a secret they know about a person important to the adventure.  
Encourage the players to take inspiration from the media they enjoy too, as long as it contributes to the theme of the game. Some gaming groups do not mind a ‘gonzo’ element, where styles clash and things don’t have to make much sense, where others prefer a more realistic or immersive game; these are things that should be discussed while setting expectations during the zero session.

**‘6. Use your own words’**  
Don’t worry about having an expansive and impressive vocabulary, it's more important to express the details in clear and precise language. A good GM doesn’t need to be a scholar, they just need to be engaging; and it's more engaging when your words come naturally and the presentation is authentic. With that being said, if eloquent prose is your forte, by all means utilize those gifts, but do be careful to not lose your players’ attention, misdirect them, or confuse them with archaic verbiage. Try to speak off the cuff as often as possible; if you need prompts, keep your notes simple and easily read. Favor brevity.

**'7. Show, don’t tell’**  
This means keeping GM info hidden from players. Lean towards only telling the players what is observable or known by their characters. Players shouldn’t know or be told a monster’s stats or abilities, and should be discouraged from using out-of-game knowledge-- this is called ‘meta-gaming.’ A great way to discourage meta-gaming is to never speak the monsters names or mechanics. A good example would be to describe a squad of hulking, warty giants instead of simply stating ""there are ten ogres.""  
If a character might look to possess knowledge about a specific creature or object in the game, that's okay, but that info should be delivered with language that feels like what that player’s character would understand; for instance, don’t discuss a monster’s hit points, just describe its fortitude or its apparent injuries. Some players may have read the materials you are using, simply because they might be a GM at times too, or are just a fan of the material. This is great! They just have to honor the notion that they know things that their character doesn’t, and vice versa; they shouldn’t spoil any secrets inherent to the game’s enjoyment.  
Be forthcoming about important information but skip lengthy lore dumps, providing relevant details while implying deeper mysteries, while avoiding unimportant things that might cause pointless sidetracking. And try to resist any urge to reveal things the players missed after the fact, or what was improvised by you during the game either, always preserving an air of mystery around the GM’s knowledge. Keep your secrets secret, a magician never reveals how they did their tricks…

**‘8. Allow the players to succeed’**  
We are always looking for ways to challenge the players but we want to avoid bottlenecks or stoppages where the players squander too much of their time or that create unnecessary friction. The best way to avoid these scenarios is to provide the players with an infinite number of tools to succeed. This specifically means allowing for the creation of new pieces of fiction on the fly; examples might include introducing a faction the players can ally with, or an unexpected occurrence like a locked door being left ajar, a significant weather event, or dropping an obvious clue. Stir things up, provide a living world that always changes and presents new pieces of fiction the players can exploit; but do so while ratcheting up the pressure all the while. Every success or failure should raise the stakes, and alter the environment, even if just subtly. The important thing is to keep things moving and to keep the scene changing.  
Don’t worry if your game ends up seeming easy, it can be a lot of fun to win easily; this outcome is often way too underrated! Feeling powerful is as much of a part of the fun as feeling challenged. As the GM, you are the keeper of information and you should distribute that information freely, too often we can feel like we are giving away too much, when in fact we are not giving out enough. And sometimes the hammer just falls; if the characters fail, that's okay! From my experience, it is more fun to fail than to flounder, as the failure feels finite and temporary, while floundering feels like a loop or a trap.  
Some games are deadlier than others, and players cherish their characters differently, which are things you should consider when applying pressure. The likelihood of character death(or failure) is another good thing to discuss during your zero session or while planning the game. Character death can be upsetting, while remaining fair and impartial, also be kind about how this might affect a player, and take a break if needed.  
Be a fan of the players’ characters. You should be rooting for them to succeed, and even in those moments where you’re all facing the impartiality of the dice, the GM should be invested in the players’ goals, and express solidarity with the players when a twist of fate sends things off course.

**‘9. Fail forward’**  
Bad rolls happen, and should be part of the fun of the game, but the GM should never let the results of a bad roll prevent something important to the continuation of the adventure from happening. Instead, use the bad roll to let the players advance in a less than optimal way, like losing an advantage, or introducing some new danger or bad omen. Another way to look at this is to let a good roll be a ‘door’ and a bad roll be a ‘window.’ This means the good roll allows the player to ‘pass,’ while the bad roll prevents them from ‘passing,’ but perhaps provides the player with useful information, or suggests a different approach. While forging outcomes for a roll, using this method fosters the ‘fail forward’ notion by letting pivotal rolls, whether they're good or bad, always be a form of advancement.  
And sometimes bad rolls are just bad rolls, so when you need to let a terrible outcome come to pass, just provide a new circumstance to deal with as a result. Even during a “TPK”(total party kill), the next round of characters should see the effects of what the previous party had done, and build on that to approach the game in a different way. Depending on the intended lethality of your game, you could use character death as an opportunity to raise the stakes, increase drama, and introduce new information.  
You shouldn’t ask the players to roll for every action they take, sometimes it makes sense that they would just automatically succeed(or fail) if their idea was good, or their character is competent at such a task, or their chosen action is of little to no consequence. Sometimes the story just really needs to move forward without a roll getting involved and potentially mucking things up. A type of roll we should be looking to avoid is one we would keep asking the players to continually make until one of them hopefully succeeds. Avoiding rolls that could inhibit the game is a good practice, and by not having the players make lots of meaningless dice rolls, you can signal to them where they should be looking.

**‘10. Prioritize fun!’**  
You are the facilitator of fun, it is your most important job. Every group is different, so focus on the things your players like and handwave the things they don’t like. If a certain mechanic is dragging the game down, ditch it or modify it. Learn the system you are using but don’t feel beholden to it, this is *your* game.  
Keep an eye on the mood of the table, making sure players are being respectful towards each other. It’ll be everyone’s job to balance the feelings at the table, but as the GM you’ll have the best chance to curb bad behavior, which hopefully won’t happen if we set expectations properly. Calling out bad or irritating behavior at the table, or even creepy vibes, is sometimes necessary, but if it can wait until you can speak with the offending player privately, that's often the best way. If something gets out of hand to the point where it needs to be dealt with immediately, address it politely, and if needed, look to the other players for support when confronting the offending player or players, but do so while not seeming like you are ganging up on anyone. Calmly explain why what they’re doing isn't appropriate and then help them get involved in a more constructive way.  
Be patient with inexperienced players or anyone who is confused about something in the game and always respond kindly to even the most basic questions, so long that they’re relevant to the game.  
If you notice things are lagging, or the players are tired, disinterested, or even offended by something, perhaps call that session early, or expedite the current scene and move on. And always remember that the GM is a player too, and that you should be enjoying the game too. GM burnout is a very real thing; if needed, end a session early or skip a scheduled game to rejuvenate. As the saying goes “No gaming is better than bad gaming”

**‘11. Leave your ego at the door’**  
A great adventure is not hinged on the GMs amazing intellect or writing talents. Avoid overengineering adventures so much that the players feel like rats forced to hunt cheese in your maze or actors in your movie. The adventure should feel like a shared creative endeavor where everyone gets to influence the story’s trajectory and outcome, not the GMs personal project. Even during a simple dungeon crawl, the players can end up doing unexpected things that should leave you scratching your head. Instead of feeling frustrated that the players aren’t engaging with the story in the way you had hoped, simply embrace the chaos, and leave behind the expectations you had for how things would play out. This goes back to the ‘don’t railroad’ sentiment. but goes a bit further in that you should remember the players didn’t come to hear you spin a tale, they came to play characters in a game.  
Conversely, players should have no expectations that you are their entertainer. It's everyone at the table's responsibility to contribute to the fun. The players should respect that you put in the effort to make the game happen, and make a cooperative effort to explore what you have put before them. And if a player is having a bad time, don’t take it to heart, sometimes players need to figure out if they can enjoy something or not themselves. Just be there to help if you can.  
It's also okay to pause the game because you’re feeling overwhelmed, or because the players wandered too far away from the things you had prepared for that session, and you need more time to do additional preparation for the next part of the game; just don’t outwardly express exasperation about it, try to be excited to explore that new angle when you reconvene.  
You should be open to learning new ideas and methods, and always look for ways to improve. Confidence is an important trait for GMs to have but you should also look for chances to be humble. If you are called out by a player for any mistakes you may have made, be honest but don’t dwell on it, you can fix the mistake and quickly move on. As the GM you are not the ‘leader,’ though your presence is vital.  
You must be thoughtful about the way you wield the power that comes with GMing. Never feel vengeful towards or overly protective of any specific players, you will need to embrace impartiality and treat the players as equals. And always be kind to yourself and remember that perfection is not your goal.

I hope these notes are helpful to others. For me, it was a productive exercise to write it all down and join some disconnected philosophical threads together into a cohesive method. It certainly isn't the only way to run awesome games, but these ideas have helped me get the kind of gaming experience I was after. My time spent pursuing this hobby has brought me joyful memories and lasting friendships with people I have met along the way, as well as its share of awkward or uncomfortable moments, and thankfully, just a few regrettable incidents. All in all, these experiences didn’t just inform my opinions on gaming, but have helped me be better at connecting with my peers. Being a GM has been a rewarding way to have a creative outlet with very little pressure attached. And it has been thrilling to regularly create with others for no other reason than to pass the time while indulging in each others’ limitless imaginations. Let's hope for us all to find many more years of enjoyment doing the things we love. Happy gaming!",rpg,1742217336.0,0,25922,4520

794,102,1jd9mw7,System suggestion for a grand conspiracy filled adventure,"Hi there I would I have an idea for a long campaign to run, but I think I would need a different system to play in.

# TLDR:

I have an idea for a game, set in present-ish times, where the players get toghether for a simple adventure (A heist, an archeological dig, find a McGuffin etc) where they find out that the world they knew was a lie, and the Conspiracy people were onto something. They uncover the mysteries of the world, travel far and wide beyond the ice wall so that they can do the thing and save the world.

But Im not sure on what system I would like to use for this, see my ideas below in the SYSTEM part of the post. Thanks

# LONGER GAME SETTING

So I got the idea while watching Milo Rossi´s conspiracy debunking videos, where some guy was showing this big map of the Flat earth and all its Beyond the Ice Wall DLC-s and my thought was...THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT GAME TO RUN. So I want to run it.

The setting would be Real world, with elements of Low Fantasy based on Cryptids, conspiracies and other fun stuff. Meaning there are lizard people, magic users, dragons and magic artefacts, but these are rare and not many exist (at least not in the base world) These would be dangerous and powerful, or whimsical and weird.

Ex. There woudl be dragons, rare with just a few living. They are Old and Powerful and ELDRICH Creatures, so if you try and fight it, you will need to roll another character becasue you aint beating a grant magical creature with sticks and guns.

I dont have the full story yet, but it would be somethign on the lines of:

\- The players get hired for a job for some archeological/corporate job where they need to reclaim the THING (tm). This will be a map, or part of a puzzle, or idk some grand magic artefact. But along the adventure they get betrayed (by the company or a rival company), and this sets off events where they venture on an adventure to get revenge or to see what is beyond.

# SYSTEM HELP.

So Ive played a few trpg games in the past, and have a general knowledge for 5E but none of the systems I know would fit snuggly for the game. It would be good ifg it was a symple system, with room to improvise.

It would be equal parts **EXPLORATION/TRAVEL  - SOCIAL STUFF/INFORMATION GATHERING - FIGHTING/COSMIC HORROR (ish)**

**DnD:** I Like DnD 5E as much as the next person, but I think its too complicated for newer players, and while the setting is fine, I just feel off to use that

**Powered by the Apocalypse:** I like the offshoots of this game system, but we played this and I just dont Vibe with this. ( I really want to use this, becasue its great, but not sure if it would work)

**Moster of The Week:** I have ample experience in this one, and would love to use it for this game, since it checks most boxes, but I dont think it would be the best fit, due to the nature of the game itself with the Doomsday clock and such.

Other systems I saw, and could work but who knows.

**Into the Odd, Liminal Horror, Cult, Roadside Picnic**

795,103,1jd8x1w,"Felt unsatisfied with the tools the Avatar system gave me, but a small change made things more interesting.","For the bulk of running the game as a GM, I  found the main... actions and abilities given to be rather lackluster. There were many different speech based checks, but every physical act fell under ""training"" or ""luck."""" Even recollection of knowledge. I stopped asking for rolls at point because of how lackluster much of it felt, which may have been a feature, not a bug, but it didn't feel all that engaging even then.

Well, the final in-game day rolled around, and the party found themselves racing against the clock playing catchup on the machinations of 4 conflicting factions. To make the pressure tangible and evoke a greater sense of climactic build-up, I decided to throw out the main gameplay system and told them ""every dice roll you make going forward will have you step towards an ideal and use it to make the roll. Use fatigue to negate it."" At that point, the character's relationship with the balance system became front and center and despite their only being two balance stats period—which are mutually exclusive—their nebulous nature and potential for disaster if the players are not careful suddenly heightened the pressure. One player told me, ""I don't know how my character is going to fair in combat."" To which I expressed sympathy, but also told them to figure it out—because in a sense that is the pressure their characters are feeling as well and if they want to succeed they need to start finding balance. The whole point of the mechanic.

Looking back on the game, I've found that... while there are uses for ideals in the system, they're rather easy to ignore. My players never spent fatigue to use them. In a sense, I think the core of the game should be further integrated into the balance system, over standard stats, and actions that the loop was written to be now. By having balance be the default, not only do they need to interpret their every action between two conflicting worldviews but devote enough of themselves to them to get stuff done but not so much they ruin themselves and I think if the system really leaned into that as it's foundation it could be much more engaging. Instead, it feels like a facsimile of a ""normal"" rpg stats + skills base with its hook incidentally tacked on. 

This is my first PbtA system so I won't comment on that as a whole and I'm well aware of the prospect I'm running it wrong, but these were my two cents on running a short campaign since last June.",rpg,1742205065.0,0,2428,431

Reverse D&D has one player and X GMs, where X is the number of people playing minus the one self-appointed/designated as player. It can be dressed up in several ways based on a chosen setting. 

**Here's an example setting:**

A devout prince (say, knight, or cleric) must save a princess from the clutches of a terrible, avaricious, and malevolent Black Dragon. However, the captive princess is, in truth, a primordial being of magic, who only let herself be captured in order to see who will rise to the challenge and save her, in the process finding her perfect soulmate. The princess has little animal familiars across the continent, and when a potential rescuer decides to try and save her, the familiars inform the princess. 

The princess wants to vet these rescuers - after all, she doesn't want just anyone to come and save her, lest she end up with some brute or, worse, someone whose political views on peasant taxation don't match her own. So when the devout prince makes his grand claim and sets off to save the princess, the game begins.

In this setting, the player is the white knight. The captured princess is the GMs. Because the captured princess is a being of untold magical prowess, she can split up into several copies of herself (that is, into as many copies as there are GMs) which waft, unseen and unnoticed, out of the dragon's lair as mist rises in the morning. The simulacra - themselves beings of old magic by sake of their replicate nature - can in turn transform into anyone and anything (from small objects to whole cities). 

It is these simulacra the player will encounter over and over again in his journey towards the princess. All for one! All for love!

**Gameplay**:

\[I'm imagining each session equalling one level's worth of experience. This can of course be modified. Level 1 is the exception, and will be described later\].

If the session is meant to last two hours, and there are 4 GMs, then each GM should prep for about half an hour of GMing. 

The session begins with each GM (simulacra) rolling initiative. Then each GM reveals their choice for the session, and they proceed in order of their rolls. 

The choices to be revealed are chosen from the following list: ""Combat"", ""Roleplay"", ""Challenge"" and ""Location"". These choices would have been chosen, and prepped for, before the session. 

The player makes it through the session and gains a level at the end.

**Gameplay in action:**

Let us say there are 6 players. In this setting, one is the designated white knight. Five are the designated GMs. The player is at Level 2.

The five GMs roll initiative, then all of them reveal their choice. The order comes out as: ""Roleplay"", ""Combat"", ""Location"", ""Challenge"", ""Combat"". Each GM will have to provide a plausible narrative for their choice and each GM will have to continue the narrative created by the one preceding them.

\*

The first GM (""Roleplay"") has it easy, as they have no one to follow. For instance, an old friend of the devout knight tries to dissuade him from embarking on such a perilous adventure.

***Roleplay****:*  Roleplay allows the player to develop their character (flaws and all) and, as always, can involve all sorts of rolls and antics. Roleplay is always an opportunity for character development.

\*

The second GM (""Combat"") has to build on the previous. Let's say the second GM had prepared 2 standard goblins as an encounter. Following the first GM, this second GM can choose to have the goblins sneak in, kill the old friend, and then attempt to kill the devout knight. OR they can choose to have the goblins be hirelings of the old friend who *really* wants to convince the devout knight of the dangers ahead. OR the old friend leaves the player in a huff and finds themselves in trouble, so the player has to save their friend from the goblins.

***Combat****:* In short, just like any other kind of choice, ""Combat"" will be prepped before the session, but how it fits into the story is decided impromptu based on the previous GMs narrative and the player's actions. Combat is always an opportunity for character growth and story development. 

\*

The third GM (""Location"") will then lead the player into where they are subsequent to the goblin encounter. ""Location"" choices move the story forward, geographically-speaking, towards the princess, and offer what locations usually offer: shops, equipment, dungeons, etc. If the second GM decided the goblins sneak into the castle, but the third GM had prepped a little hamlet on the castle's rural outskirts, the player and the third GM figure out how he gets there. Or one of the goblins, close to dying, escapes in the direction of the hamlet. Or the knight's old friend has been killed by said goblins, and the knight must inform his friend's mother of her son's death. His mother lives in the little hamlet.

***Location****:* As usual, ""Location"" and travel is the usual balance between the player's free choices and the GM's overall plan for the campaign.  

\*

The fourth GM (""Challenge"") has prepped a puzzle with levers and traps, with the prize for solving it being a mystical clue to the location of the captive princess. (Remember, the GM is a simulacrum of the princess, so they *want* to lead the knight to the princess - how else will they test if he's worthy?). 

So, if the player is now at his dead friend's mother's house, maybe the player hears strange noises in the basement, and finds an alchemical lab with the puzzle to be solved there. (Is the friend's mother an alchemist? Sure!). Or, if the player's friend is still alive and in the third GM's hamlet, maybe the friend has heard rumour of a wizard tower in the forest surrounding the hamlet it - finding it and solving the puzzle would be the challenge. 

***Challenge:*** This can incorporate all sorts of puzzles, skill checks, and non-combat difficulties that allow space for challenging the player (rather than the player's character) as well as letting the dice do their portion of story telling.

\*

The fifth GM has also chosen ""Combat"". Let's say this GM, given the player's current level of 2, has prepared a Brown Bear. Depending on where they are - and you get the gist by now - the bear can either be in the forest surrounding the wizard's tower, or it can erupt from a strangely-coloured phial in the alchemy basement (""Didn't you notice it steadily grow a deeper shade of brown as the minutes ticked by? No? You must have been too focused on the puzzle...""), or it can burst out of a locked room, a lord's pet kept illegally in the castle (if the player is still there) 

\*

As you can see, what Reverse Dungeons and Dragons (R&D&D?) does best is: prevent railroading; have all players at the table take charge of the story; create wacky and unforeseen causes and effects though its full embrace of improv's ""yes and...""; really focus on character development; allow the usual strengths of D&D (dice, combat, roleplay, etc.) to shine.

***The Level 1 Exception***

Level 1 should be the exception in that it gets everyone used to things.

In this case only, the GMs do not roll for initiative. Instead, the order of choices is pre-set as ""Location"", ""Roleplay"", ""Challenge"", and ""Combat"", in that order, to ease everyone into the game style and provide a solid story foundation (character, setting, motivations, goals) atop of which to build future sessions.

***Identical Choices***

Let's say a session begins with the following choice order: ""Roleplay, Roleplay, Combat, Combat, Challenge"". 

In cases where two adjacent choices are identical (in this case, two adjacent Roleplay choices, and two adjacent Combat choices), then those choices should be merged.

If the GM for Roleplay 1 had prepped a friendly Green Hag, and the GM for Roleplay 2 had prepped a mysterious traveller, then both GMs play at the same time. The Green Hag and the Mysterious Traveller met on the road a few minutes before they encounter the player. Or the Mysterious Traveller guides the player to the Green Hag. Or they're lovers. Or enemies with a common goal. Or they're arguing about who has the better cloak. Either way, the player has to talk to two very real NPCs simultaneously, something that's not usually possible with one GM who has their NPCs - even when encountered in the plural - act in order.

If the GM for Combat 1 has chosen a rival knight, and the GM for Combat 2 has chosen a gargoyle, then perhaps the rival knight, as he attacks the player, gets interrupted by gargoyles who want to eat the both of them for breaking rules of chivalry. Or perhaps the knight enlisted the help of a local wizard to awaken the gargoyles and aid him in his attack on the player. Or the player made a mistake in the prior roleplay with the mysterious traveller, who, in retribution, animates a gargoyle to attack him and tips off a rival knight as to the whereabouts of the player.

For all these, I imagine a brief scuffle behind the GM screen, as GMs quickly decide on how things will happen. ""This, and then this? Or these together?"" ""No no, what do you think of *this* instead??"" ""Yeah!""

***The Simulacra's Boredom***

The simulacra don't just fulfil their role (as a Green Hag, as a hamlet, as an alchemy lab, as a bear, etc.) and then disappear. They may disappear from the player's view, but they're still around.

*And they're bored*. Just as the princess of whom they're a copy, they don't enjoy hanging about. They need to be active. Couple this with strong opinions, and they might very well interfere with what another simulacrum is doing with the purpose of testing the devout knight's fittingness for the princess. 

As such, inactive GMs have one GM Action to expend on each active GMs turn. This is a feature purely to make sure everyone at the table is involved at all times, with the added benefit of throwing further chaos in the midst. The following GM Actions can be modified and added to, but, as a starting point, GMs have the following actions to choose from:

\- Reroll (an inactive GM might try to make the active GM's gargoyles hit instead of miss, or might try to see what the Green Hag would have done if she rolled lower perception. The inactive GM does the rerolling and the narration stemming from the new canon result);

\- Rando (an inactive GM can introduce another NPC, whether it's a silly villager stumbling into the middle of a combat, or the Mysterious Traveller's brother wanting his 5 gold back, or a gargoyle who acts very much like a labrador puppy. Each instance allows the player an expanding field of choices - do they save the villager, or ignore her? Do they help the traveller's brother, or attack him? Do they adopt the gargoyle puppy, or use it as a barking shield for the next attack? Because different GMs are operating at the same time here, you can overload the playing field much more than with what a sole GM can do, as the active GM can continue focussing on the gargoyles while the inactive GM takes care of the villager's actions).

\- Natural Event (a table of different environmental events can be drafted - depending on the setting - and the inactive GM taking their GM Action would roll on that table. This could mean a meteor squashes the rival knight, or a roaming banshee kidnaps the green hag mid-revelation, or it's raining and the player is now miserable and wet).

**Nations Game Military System (Dice-Based)**

This system determines **battle outcomes, troop movements, and military effectiveness** using dice rolls while considering factors like terrain, unit composition, and morale.





Each type of unit has a Strength(dmg), Range(hit range and detection range), Movement(movement/turn), and Special(unique traits)



Each adv is a +1, each dis is a -1

Each unit has different die

Can assign a general to a army



All troops have morale that I decide based on factors like battle length, home battles, supply lines, battle actions, they have the possibility to defect, switch sides, etc. if they keep low.

  


Generals and Command Structure





Players can assign a General to an army, providing strategic bonuses and unique abilities. Generals influence:

Troop Morale: Affecting unit effectiveness and resilience.

Tactical Maneuvers: Granting special actions or rerolls.

Battle Modifiers: Improving attack, defense, or movement capabilities.

Choosing the right general for the right battle can be as crucial as having a well-trained army.

# Phase 1: Deployment and Travel

This phase is dedicated to positioning troops, setting up fortifications, and preparing for engagements. It includes:



Troop Movement: Maneuver armies across the battlefield, determining their locations and potential engagement areas.



Deployment: Assign troops to key locations, fortify positions, and prepare for battle.



Reconnaissance: Scout enemy positions to gain intelligence on their numbers, location, and potential strategies.



This phase determines the initial conditions for battle and can set the stage for success or failure.



# Phase 2: Defense and Trapping

This phase allows armies to set up defensive measures before battle begins. It includes:



Constructing Fortifications: Build barricades, trenches, and other defenses.

Laying Traps: Set up ambushes, pitfalls, and other battlefield hazards.

Positioning Units: Strategically place troops to optimize defense.

Unit Camouflage and Concealment: Utilize terrain and special abilities to evade detection.

A well-prepared defense can turn the tide of battle, mitigating numerical disadvantages and disrupting enemy plans.



# Phase 3: Attack and Engagement

If forces have encountered each other, combat is resolved in this phase. Combat resolution follows these key mechanics:



1. Scale Ratio Multiplier (SRM) & Force Comparison

SRM has a dual meaning:

Combat Scaling:

Each unit type has a Strength (Damage), Range (Hit & Detection Range), Movement (Per Turn), and Special Traits.

Compare the size of each force.

The smaller force sets the baseline for the engagement scale.

For every full increment of the baseline above the opponent’s force, the larger force gains an additional damage die.

If the difference is minor (less than the baseline increment), the larger force only gains advantage (+1 modifier), while the smaller force has disadvantage (-1 modifier).

If the larger force vastly outnumbers the smaller force (e.g., 1,000 vs. 1,000,000), the smaller force is overwhelmed.



Unit Attributes (SRM):

Strength (S): Determines the unit's base damage die. (and amount of die will go here but thats based on troop amount)

Range (R): Determines both the effective attack range and detection capability.

Movement (M): Determines how far a unit can travel per turn.

Special Traits: Unique abilities or characteristics that provide tactical advantages.



2. Combat Resolution

Both sides roll damage dice based on troop types and numbers.

The higher roll determines the victor in that round of combat.

Modifiers such as terrain, traps, general abilities, and unit abilities can influence results.

After resolution, an estimate is made of how many troops remain on each side.

Each group of troops can act separately within this phase, allowing for multiple engagements if applicable.



# Phase 4: Supply and Recuperation

After battle, forces must manage logistics and recovery. This phase involves:



Supply Line Check: Determines whether the army has an intact and operational supply chain. If supply lines are cut, forces may suffer attrition and lack reinforcements.

Foraging and Resource Gathering: If no supply lines exist, troops must rely on local resources, which are often insufficient for sustained warfare.

Reinforcements and Recovery: If supply lines are intact, forces may receive troop reinforcements, ammunition, food, and medical aid, allowing them to recover before the next battle.

Once this phase is completed, the system loops back to Phase 1: Deployment and Travel, continuing the cycle of warfare.

We just finished a campaign where the rules were very much on the style of Noah the Magic — simple and to the point, roll for everything with little to no modifiers, and was basically not too roleplay-friendly. I am gonna be the new DM, and I had a campaign idea, so I mashed a couple of rules from different games, and we are going to stress test the system on a session zero with some premade characthers where their backstory is prety short  . But I wanted some advice on what to add or change, or if I should just go ahead and put everything aside for now and use a pre-existing system if it fits the game idea, which is kind of like a Terror Infinity, where they have a space they can get powers, bloodline, magic, everything, and then they drop into various worlds where they can do missions for points to use in the space.  


RACE
Human(starting)
A boon from the entity allows the character to integrate certain bloodlines, granting traits. When too many are mixed, they can cause disadvantages due to conflicting aspects or even advantages. There will be opportunities to remove some or alleviate conflicts, or players can choose to integrate only one thing, such as vampires. In a side adventure, they can collect different vampire bites to fix disadvantages or gain advantages.
STATS and Resources
• Health: When higher, it provides bonuses to physical stats; when lower, it results in disadvantages. The higher your physical stats, the higher your health will be.
• Mana: Once depleted, you can use health to cast spells or sanity to activate special abilities.
• Sanity: When higher, it gives bonuses to mental stats; when lower, it causes disadvantages based on wisdom.
• Tokens: Boons granted to characters by the eldritch being allow the use of special abilities, such as common sense, or can be used to increase the number on a roll. For example, if you roll a d4 and get a 3, you can spend a token to get to 4 and roll again.
• Favor: Can be used after big stories in the space to get anything.
• Cash: Used in stories to get items or bribes.
The following stats are assigned to dice rolls such as d20 or d4. You can choose either to halve the roll for a stable result or roll freely to try for a higher number. You can also gain stable increases to each stat based on traits (unless specified, they affect the total, not the dice roll), such as a 

""Jock"" trait providing boosts to body and stamina.
• Body: Affects physical speed, strength, and similar rolls.
• Stamina: Determines health regeneration speed and how long you can run.
• Dexterity: Influences intricate movements or crafting abilities.
• Mind: Governs any logical rolls.
• Emotional: Impacts emotional rolls, mental strength, charm, etc.
• Perception: Affects both passive and active perception.

TRAITS
Traits are obtained through gameplay or backstory. They provide access to increased stats, new skills (both beneficial and detrimental), replace traditional classes, and can be leveled up.
Skills and Expertise
Special abilities or knowledge that a character might have or get based on traits might require resources to use or just time and a good roll, such as first aid vs. heal.
• Common sense: Costs a certain amount of tokens depending on difficulty and can be complemented with a high roll or sanity.
• Meta gaming: Allows for the transfer of knowledge or skills from players to characters, similar to common sense.
Gameplay Mechanics
• When rolling a stat and hitting the max number, you can roll again to get a higher roll, making it possible to get very high rolls even if you are focused on mental stats.
• When performing certain actions, you can get tokens (up to the DM's discretion). When failing, the enemy might get one, 

or you might; when succeeding, you can get one.
• When making certain choices that contribute to the narrative or successfully completing certain challenges or missions, you can get tokens or favors.
• Injuries: When taking a certain amount of damage to sanity or health, you get injuries, which would fall under a negative trait (temporary).
• After each encounter is solved, you get the opportunity to use favor with the being.
• Plot armor: Allows for a character to roll extra dice on every roll and/or gain advantage (roll two dice and use the higher of the two). It can be restored, and it gets chipped away.
• Disadvantage: Certain traits or choices might grant disadvantages (which mean you have to roll the lower of the two dice).
•	If you get both advantage and disadvantage at the same time, they cancel out unless the advantage or disadvantage is stacked more than 2 times (e.g., 3A vs. 1D). If it’s 4A vs. 1D or there’s a 3 or more stack difference, special things happen.
• If you succeed a roll or fail a roll by more than 5, it becomes a critical roll, and it improves by every 5 away.
• When players decide to tackle one of the big stories, they get teleported to the specific story.
•	Once completed, they gain access to that region and certain new side missions and discount on certain items . And an inheritance 
•	In between big stories, they can go on side adventures, fight some monsters, and do some relaxing, non-consequential grinding.
• When doing big stories, players might be granted certain 

restrictions, which the entity will compensate for with tokens.
Game Lore
An extremely powerful entity has made a space beetween where different stories interact and exist in the same place, yet they do not seem to fuse outside of some isolated cases. Thus, the entity has summoned you or awakened some of you to accomplish certain tasks to fuse the stories in exchange for certain desires of your characters.
• If you are good, then the entity is being opposed by an evil entity who wishes to make these single stories into a world of horror and pain.
• If you are bad, then you are trying to recruit evil beings  or serve the evil being by being the bad guys 
Or An extremely powerful entity has made a space beetween where stories,exist the entity has summoned you 
• Or it’s a VR game.

Environment plays a part on everything if it's dark that would affect Perception And force players to use light sources that could signal their location 
In certain location resources such as water and food would be consumed faster
Certain traits Might change based on player actions

811,119,1jcug3u,Do you prefer Vancian or roll to cast?,"We'll consider modern DnD's pseudo-Vancian system to also be Vancian for the purposes of this conversation. I prefer roll to cast. It makes magic seem dangerous and uncontrollable. When magic is perfectly controllable by someone of sufficient skill, it's not really magic anymore. If you're studying techniques that create a perfectly replicable effect, then that's basically just science that operates under a different set of laws of physics than our own. Magic should always have a chance of going catastrophically wrong. When you're giving the middle finger to the fundamental rules of reality, sometimes it should give one back.

It also makes magic something to not be used frivolously. It can be easy for magical characters to overshadow mundane ones. ""Why have a Rogue when the Wizard can cast knock?"" is a question commonly asked in games like DnD to demonstrate the martial caster gap. In a roll to cast system however, the question inverts. Magic has a risk to it and it becomes a last resort. It ends up being used only when neccesary, which keeps it rare and more mysterious. This also fits with a lot of the more classic depictions of wizards. Gandalf is the archetypical wizard, and he doesn't exactly run around throwing fireballs left and right. He resorts to his sword more often than not and only uses magic when it's needed. I've always preferred this kind of wizard to the kind we have now in a lot of RPGs that seems to play more like mages in Skyrim (not a knock on Skyrim, I love the game I just want something different out of TTRPGs).

Roll to cast systems represent a danger to magic that also help solve a number of world building issues. Such as the age old ""Why don't mages just rule everything here?"" question. In a world where magic has inherent risk, long lived and powerful mages will have had to display an incredible amount of prudence (and possibly even a little luck )in their use of magic. This means that most mages who would be powerful enough to rule aren't likely to be of the disposition to want to. Most of the more ambitious mages are likely to have blown themselves up, or get sucked into a different dimesion before they become powerful enough to stake their claim. The few who don't however can become powerful, but rare, villains.",rpg,1742155704.0,0,2280,399

I’ve often run into walls with creativity, made 100 npcs, got 100 maps to use, thought of every scenario possible, etc. But I’ve never ran more than 1 game at a time besides maybe a one shot that I extensively prepared or ran Apocalypse World (a super easy to run ttrpg with no DM prep) on the side.

So I start up another game, however this game isn’t d&d and requires little prep. But I’m also wanting to start a game of Apocalypse World.

Personally, I really like the formatting of Paizo's Adventure Paths, where you get 5 modules that can be run individually or be combined into a campaign, but there is a hidden cost to this. 4 small books actually cost twice as much to manufacture as 1 big book, which means some of that cost gets passed on to the customer.

As a business, the idea of 4 individual books has some pros and cons. On the one hand I can offer a bundle deal and sell more product, which also makes my back catalog look larger, but on the other hand, what if someone doesn't buy the whole set and it screws up my stock numbers or they get angry because they didn't realize that the single book they got was part of a set?

The big book would come at a lower price, but it also has it's downsides. My core book is a saddle stitch zine, but if I go with a big book the page count will get too high and I would have to switch to perfect bound, which doesn't lay flat and takes away from the formatting consistency.

For reference The Nullam Project core book has an MSRP of $15 and if I went the 4 zines approach, they would also use that price *($60 total)*, though I would likely offer a bundle deal for $50 if you got all 4.  
If I did the big book, I would likely have to set the MSRP between $30 and $40, depending on how things lined up with the printer.

As a consumer, it's an easy choice for me. I would pay the extra and get the 4 smaller books, but I am not the consumer, I am the developer, so I tend to nitpick about things that a normal person might not even care about.

Does formatting and consistency matter to you?, and are you willing to pay a little more to make sure that everything matches or is the cost reduction more appealing?",rpg,1742142478.0,0,2391,467
822,130,1jcoyuw,Which system has more juice or vibe—Star Wars Saga Edition or Genesys (FFG)?,"Hey folks! So, I've been diving back into Star Wars tabletop RPGs and can’t shake this question:  
👉 **Which system brings more** ***craft*****—more** ***juice*****, more** ***Star Wars power*****—to the table?**

I’m talking about that raw **energy**, that **mythic feel**, that **cinematic punch** we all imagine when we think of Star Wars. Whether it's the classic hero’s journey, Force philosophy, scoundrels dodging blaster fire, or epic starfighter battles—what system delivers the *whole* Star Wars experience better?

Here’s where I’m at:

* **Saga Edition (D20)** is a beast. It’s crunchy, tactical, and leans into the D&D DNA. It gives you a kind of ""Knights of the Old Republic"" vibe—heroic, detailed, and pretty customizable. Lightsaber duels feel technical, and there’s a lot of depth to character builds if you like that structured gameplay.
* **FFG’s Genesys system (Edge of the Empire, Age of Rebellion, Force and Destiny)** is wild and cinematic. It’s all about narrative flow, big swings, and fast-moving stories. The dice system can make things feel unpredictable and exciting, like the chaos of a desperate escape from an Imperial Star Destroyer. It has rules for Morality, Obligation, and Duty—perfect for capturing different sides of the Star Wars mythos.

What I’m asking is:  
👉 Which game gives you that *goosebumps* Star Wars feeling?  
👉 Which one makes *Force users* feel mystical and powerful, and smugglers feel scrappy but lucky?  
👉 If you had to run the *ultimate Star Wars campaign*, which system would you trust to do it?

Both systems have their strengths, but I’m curious what others think. Give me your hot takes, your war stories, your ""I shot first!"" moments!",rpg,1742141606.0,0,1699,270
823,131,1jcnm7z,Am I overwhelming my DM?,"EDIT: Thank you so much for the feedback. Yea, i guess I got carried away a little and got a bit overexcited about making the character. I shall tone it down a a bit... a bit more 😅 From what I gathered, the character should have plenty of potential to grow during the campaign, as the background serves more as a way to set the fundamentals of the character and their goals, and I can keep all the extra stuff to myself (i'll 100% make like a wiki or something for my character, cause i think it'd be fun). I am in no way intending to change my DM's story, plot and lore, that's why I sent him all that stuff just to make sure it fits, as I'm entering the game mid campaign, after the party has already done some stuff and are lvl 3 already, and got kind of discouraged when he wasn't as excited as I was.
I actually sent him a message to apologise, promised to just give him the essentials (and asked him what he needs), and asked him if I can, for the future, clarify with him some bits about my character so that she's not far removed from the lore and logic of the game universe.

---

A friend of mine invited me to join in the middle of an ongoing DnD campaign that he's the DM of. In all my life I've only played like 2 sessions of DnD (where he was also the DM), but due to life we had to abandon that particular campaign.

Anyhow, the thing is: I've started developing my character and I might've overdone it a bit with the questions I send my friend (it's a homebrew story, so I wanted to get myself pretty immersed in the universe in order to make an authentic character; didn't really help either that my character is a custom race that he made up, so he is the only source of information on that). He answered those questions nonetheless, so we're kind of okay here.

I'm a really passionate person when it comes to making characters, OCs, etc, and I want them to feel like they're an actual person within the universe, with wants, likes, dislikes, solid personalities, and flaws and a backgorund and backstory. I also want my characters to be easily visualiseable, so I tend to make them pretty detailed and complex.

So I was checking in with my DM friend today, sending him some info about my character (like how I saw her having been in the scouting brigade of her tribe, dealing with threats as a ranger, but she lost her eye due to a curse pit on her people, so her depth perception was warped, so she had to step down and now she only goes on patrols and doesn't really take part in the action anymore. And asking him if her bow type would fit, as I took inspiration from the historically accurate bow Odysseus used, and I told my friend that I was thinking that my character wouldn't really be sneaky, as her bow makes a lot of noise due to the tension of the string, etc) The info was comprised of a few paragraphs.

The way he responded was a very exasperated and bothered ""Oh my god"" and sending me a 💀 emoji, telling me he didn't read any of it, but remarking that I just sent him a whole freaking book.

I don't want to make just ""Steve the barbarian that likes to hit things"" and I want my character to have depth and a background within the story.

Should I just tone it down, with a less developed character, or like, keep the ""useless"" details to myself and tell him only the most completely utterly important essentials?

Not to mention, I'm a very anxious and shy person, so roleplaying is not my forte and I will have to acclimate to it, so having a well established character is helping me get into the story more and portray my character more easily.

Is it a me problem? Or a him problem? Or a both of us problem?

831,139,1jcfeiy,Open Table Sessions - advice wanted,"I need your advice.

We have been running open world, open table D&D sessions for a year and a half.

All the players started at level 1 and in the same starting town and adventuring guild. Each month, DMs run a one shot and all characters return to town 
They are good for these reasons:
- the one shots allow players to drop in, drop out, play when they can and not be excluded because different groups are on different adventures that it doesn't make sense to turn up in halfway through.
- the players and DMs can mix and match each session so many people get to meet and play with each other and that builds the community.
- DMs don't have to run every session. That allows the DMs to rest, play or just skip. No pressure and the adventures continue even if some DMs are away.

However, there are downsides.
-characters don't get spotlighted for that personal drama feeling that many modern players love.
- disconnected one shots can feel like the world/the narrative doesn't progress.
- the tone of the world can vary greatly based on DM (not necessarily a problem).

From next year, we'll start again from level 5 in a new setting.
Where should we set it? I'm thinking Greyhawk.

Here's what I want to do more of to create coherence between the DMs and consistency in the world so there can be progress and the players feel their characters affect the world:

- have a shared world map that players fill in.
- have well-defined factions that have faction turns between each session and can be affected by players.
- have players propose the adventures.

What else can I do to improve our shared world, open table gaming sessions?

For the record, this post isn't meant to be self-deprecating. I'm at peace with my personality. I'm just being frank about reality.  I'm not a very charismatic person. I tend to be reserved, socializing isn't easy for me, and (at least outwardly) I'm kind of serious. I'm not very creative and even worse at anything that involves being put on the spot. Nobody will ever accuse me of being the personality hire. 

I think all those things are the reason I  love immersing myself in fantasy worlds and am curious about RPGs. But, I typically need those fantasy worlds pre-created and handed to me. If we're being realistic, I dont think I'll be really ""good"" at it. But I think I would enjoy it.

So, I'm looking for honest opinions. I don't have a built in friend group to play with that might be more tolerant/accepting of my quirks. I'd have to join in with strangers. The last thing I want to do is bring down the experience for others.

842,0,1evkr02,Discovering OSR ruined other RPG playstyles for me,"I have a background of about 7 years DMing 5e, but also World of Darkness games, Powered by the Apocalypse-like games etc. As a GM, I've basically struggled from the start, and often my struggles relate to adventure design, specifically making an interesting plot and designing a line through the adventure while leaving enough space and tools to play with to allow for player freedom. My plots never felt interesting, getting players to follow them was a pain (""my character is not interested in that"") and getting ""off the rails"" has always been scary for me, not because I'm afraid of improvising, but because once there's rails, that becomes constraining for that improvisation. And the fear of characters dying, both from players because they are very attached, and from me as it can derail the adventure. 

Discovering the OSR, it just feels more right. No grand plot but an interesting world to explore, from which a story evolves. Players being challenged themselves to be genuinely creative and resourceful and death isn't a nuisance that threatens the end the campaign, it's part of the design. A more player-driven outlook, so no more needing to convince players or characters to go on an adventure.  Admittedly these aspects might not be exclusive to OSR but the point stands. 

Knowing that this way of playing exists, makes it even more draining to prep for other games, and playing in such games can be frustrating. Knowing death isn't really on the table because nobody wants the campaign to end, just suddenly makes everything feel pointless? I don't want to meta game but when the GM clearly prepared a certain plot or adventure line, I can't help but be aware of that fact and have it influence my actions. I can't help but feel like, despite there being freedom within the boundaries of the adventure, there's still a fairly clear limit to freedom, and there's a rebellious side in me that finds that knowledge frustrating, like I'm forced to dance to someone elses tune. 

All of this frankly makes me feel a little alienated from the community at large, because this way of playing is massively popular (mostly due to 5e's success). All my friends play that way and like it, but as I've gotten frustrated with the playstyle, I feel less enjoyment playing or running those games. I wish I could fully share their enjoyment as I once did, because in the end that's the most valuable thing this hobby has given me.

* _**UK print costs for Black & White books will also increase**, but generally only by 3-4%._
* _**Standard Color print costs will increase**, by roughly 12-13% for US printing but only around 3% for UK printing._
* _On the whole, **Premium Color print costs will decrease slightly for US printing but increase slightly for UK printing.**_
     * _Example 1: A 180-page large premium hardcover currently costs $32.10 to print in the US; after April 1, that same title will drop to $27.80._
     * _Example 2: In the UK, the same 180-page book currently costs £20.23, which will increase to £20.93 starting in April._

The majority of the arguments go around “new players may find hard to navigate in OSR freedom, both in world building and rules” and also that OSR freedom may led to random stuff happening and players getting stuck in the story without knowing what to do while a storytelling adventure will always keep on track.

850,8,1hlgqap,"How to make ""being lost"" and ""finding your way"" interesting in RPG sessions?","Hello

My friend and I recently ran a session for our party in which they broke into a secret hideout made by a spy organisation. 


The conceit of the hideout was that it was underwater and that the ""corridors"" were essentially hidden. There was a map (not available to the party) and these air tunnels appeared to just be normal water and our idea of a ""puzzle"" for the hideout itself was them finding their way. Upon this actually playing out though it was actually just very unsatisfying. The players just went ""I walk with my hands out until its wet"" and we realised this essentially ""solved"" the puzzle. This wasnt an issue it was still a fun session, but its got me thinking, is there a more interesting way to do ""navigating"" in a d20 system than just rolling a dice for a ""navigation check""? This hideout example I think in retrospect was just a much more interesting piece of flavour than it was a useful puzzle, but I have always found it boring when I say ""you're lost in a forest"" I don't really have ways of facilitating anyone figuring something out or navigating in a way which doesnt feel all or nothing to the point where its not a challenge or its insurmountable. 


Has anyone got any recommendations of good blogs on this subject? Or does anyone have any good solutions for making the experience of ""being lost"" feel satisfying as a puzzle type challenge.",osr,1735056852.0,1,1376,248

Names are divided into chapters by either their intended use (e.g. divine names) or how they sound like (e.g. Anglish or Nörslik). The latter are based on how real-world names sound like but do not replicate them entirely (for historical names I recommend [Treasury of Archaic Names](https://www.acaeum.com/jg/OtherCompanies/RPGRealmTreasuryArchaicNames.html) and [The Everyone Everywhere List](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/89285/the-everyone-everywhere-list?affiliate_id=2150725)).

Full disclosure, I have books from Mork Borg to Pathfinder on my shelf, so I love systems with a wide range of crunch.  


The top comment has a bunch of discussion about OSR, rules-lite, etc. Do you feel the criticisms are valid? Of course, please don't be toxic; refrain from personal attacks, hand waving because you don't like what's being said.  

I agree with some of the criticisms; I do feel that many indie rules-lite systems miss the point of a rules lite ruleset; they might just throw in a d20 mechanic then cry ""rulings, not rules."" Rules-lite shouldn't mean all theme with a die roll slapped on.

I notice that rules-lite is kind of being conflated with narrative-driven games, Mork Borg was called a retro clone (it isn't), etc. so I do wonder whether some of these opinions are coming from folks who have read but not played some of these games.",osr,1693946306.0,1,1026,154

So, I’ll be running some Dragonlance, but grittier and nastier, sans metaplot. The setting though, more or less, will be a riff on canon.. and maybe some fanon.

Anyway, what I’m hoping for is a suitable RPG that runs quick and smooth, doesn’t have too many moving parts, and is especially friendly to the GM/DM side of things.

Tried 5e, briefly. A bit too complicated for my liking. Not quite gritty enough too. Didn’t mind the simple rules for proficiency, and advantage/disadvantage.

It would be nice to have fighters that pretty much just get better at fighting overall, and surviving of course. Thieves/rogues, maybe just sneak attack / backstab, and general sneakery, but wrapped up in as few class abilities / skills as possible (one is fine).

Just fighters, thieves, wizards and clerics would do. Minimal class abilities for all, preferred.

* Several minor NPCs with ties to the dungeons
* Rumors and adventure hooks to get the party started

The first 3 dungeons will be loosely linked together, ultimately leading to the 4 dungeon, the titular **Lair of the Forgotten Queen**. The idea is that this module can be used as a standalone adventure, or the way I'll likely use it, just dropping them into an existing game.

A little bit of story:

I would obviously love for for the Kickstarter to be successful, but even if it's not, I'm having a lot of fun, and I'll use the dungeons for my own game!

Hello everyone. I wanted to let you know about a new RPG adventure set in Irish myth and folklore. I recently released it on Amazon for physical books and on DTRPG for digital. It's called **Corruption of the Blood God**.

This a Game Master adventure is written for the *Monsters! Monsters!* & related games rules with a d6 system & saving rolls (e.g., *Tunnels and Trolls*). A rules summary is included in the appendices. It is designed for a party of 3 - 5 player characters of levels 1 - 3 (any class).

*""In a land covered by heather, bogs, mist and rolling hills, the stone circles watch … and whisper. Brave adventurers must learn why do villagers vanish near the mountains of Slieve Blahma? Is this related to recent roadside attacks? And why do some whisper of the god known as Crom Cruach, “the Bloody Crescent?” Clues can be learned from old stones, in passage tombs, from dangerous creatures of fae and the Otherworld, awakened corpses and even from the gods of this land.""*

The Corruption of the Blood God is an RPG adventure set in ancient Ireland with its gods, folklore and mythic creatures, including the Puca, the banshee, the dullahan, a mischievous clurichaun, a Wolf-man of Ossory and many more. Players explore an ancient land to discover clues about a mysterious threat. They can invoke the gods for blessings, such as the sea god Manannán, and the great raven queen known as the Morrígan. There is also an appendix that describes the Irish gods mentioned in the adventure.

This adventure includes 4 pre-generated player characters, 12 settlements, 115 NPCs, 60 random wilderness encounters and 72 rumour, all in \~ 110 pages with a colour interior\*.\*

Thanks and have a great day!",osr,1739636567.0,1,2264,314

I’ve also been wanting to make a super streamlined 2d6 solo rpg set in a dangerous magical forest. Finally it hit me to put these two ideas together.

[Forest Burial](https://nealyboy.itch.io/forest-burial)

Forest Burial is a solo Tunnel Goons hack made to fit in a commonly available gum case, along with your 2d6. The vibes are inspired by Cairn, Vermis, Princess Mononoke, and Shadow of the Colossus. There is a one sheet version for folks who don’t have or don’t want the plastic cae. It’s available for free right now of Itch, if that sounds at all interesting to you.

Here’s the set up:
You’re another fool on a quest to the center of the forest. The deeper you go, the greater the dangers will become. Ancient powers. Monstrous guardians. Strange landmarks. Villages make terrible pacts. Heroes die.

PS: The side benefit of using a gum case is that it makes your game nice and minty. Not enough minty RPGs in my opinion.

If you like doomed settlement games akin to Kingdom Death: Monster, then you should enjoy the mechanics in this multi session RPG adventure for the MÖRK Borg rules system.

In a world on the brink, a resilient hamlet faces a terrifying onslaught. Flesh-eating flies swarm the village each night, their insatiable hunger a constant threat. Players must lead their community, fortifying the barricade, tending to the fire, and maintaining morale. But their true test lies beyond the hamlet perimeter. Daily, they'll send brave souls into the desolate landscape to confront the evil that has brought this terror upon them.

This adventure started life as something I was playing around with for my RPG group and I never really intended for it to go much further than that.

However, my group is all 5e players who don't have money to drop on a new rpg, want to learn a new system, and generally enjoy being entertained by a story they can interact with by doing the cool stuff their character sheet gives them. TL;DR: They would have no interest in playing Fantasy Trip.

Should I still get it even if I won't be playing it? If it's a 10/10 system with some ideas I can harvest and some advice on DMing Dungeon crawly games I'll get it, but if especially Into the Labyrinth is just some more system and Melee is the best part, I probably won't.

It details a **campaign setting**, a **wilderness hex-crawl**, a **sprawling underworld** connecting to multiple entrances on the surface, and most importantly, an **enormous megadungeon**.

* **Volume 1**: The first book covers the arctic frontier's settlements, cultures, religions, and its vast wilderness regions. It includes an urban starter quest and five low-level dungeons.
* **Volume 2**: The second book details the underworld below the continent's surface and six mid-level dungeons.
* **Volume 3**: The third book explores Castle Thar-Gannon, its upper halls, mysterious towers, and underground levels. It also includes the Cyclopean City deep under the earth, which leads to the entire adventure's climax: the Tesseract of Time.

The first volume is designed for a **heroic party of 6-8 characters** to begin at **1st level** and reach a minimum of **5th level** by the book's conclusion, although most parties will hit **7th-8th level** if all wilderness encounters are exhausted. Though the mega-adventure was originally designed as a sandbox, it also supports episodic ""adventure path"" play-styles, as well.

***Ruthless Heavens, Boundless Fate*** is an epic Role-Playing Game of cosmic adventure and power cultivation inspired by the LitRPG genre. In it, players play as **Ascendants**, powerful characters that due to a combination of talent, luck and sheer determination have become the de-facto rulers of their nations. Unfortunately for them, this means little in the cosmic scale, and they quickly find out that they are at the bottom of the power ladder. Their planet has just been introduced to the Path of Ascendancy by the Ruthless Heavens, and as such the rest of the Nolurian Sector is now aware of its existence. It falls to them to become strong enough to protect their homeland, exploring the sector for new opportunities while sending them resources so they can eventually be strong themselves. Through hard work and fortuitous encounters they will have the chance to do so, while reaching new heights of power and cultivation.

***Ruthless Heavens, Boundless Fate*** features:

* A robust D20 ruleset compatible with most OSR systems and games.
* A gazetteer of the Nolurian Sector, exploring the main locations of interest, such as the Wandering City of Yeross, the different factions and their conflicts, and the motivations behind the mysterious cosmic force known as the Ruthless Heavens.
* Detailed character creation, with 5 different original ancestries, 8 classes, 10 unique lineages, random background generation, and rules to improve your soul, body, and bloodline, which are at the core of character progression.
* A unique skill system with 100 different powers that you can personalize and evolve, combining them into your signature power set of 9 active skills. Found a cool new skill? Replace an old one with it!
* Living Weapon rules to find and evolve your unique artifact, feeding it different resources that you must gather during your travels across the Nolurian Sector, and tailoring its powers to your specific wants and needs.
* Different pre-made locations such as Trials, Hunting Grounds, or Divine Decrees, for you to explore and investigate, each with their different challenges, events, encounter tables, and more.
* Hexploration rules to randomly generate different locations across different planets. 
* Rules to expand your settlement between adventures, with a collection of buildings and facilities that grant your character a series of benefits. 
* The most exhaustive collection of solo rules and tools ever found in a Blackoath game, allowing you to play the game solo or co-op!",osr,1715878956.0,1,2913,435

910,70,tahrx0,What’s the best bit(s) of RPG related advice you’ve read or received? For playing or GMing. Things that radically improved your game.,"For me I think it was the distinction between Intent and Approach for player actions; which I picked up from the Angry GM. I won’t adjudicate anything anymore until I have this info, and as soon as I absorbed the necessity to have it I was surprised to see how often either Approach or Intent are omitted from actions taken by players. 

The result of enforcing it has encouraged a very visceral connection with the fiction of the game world, and empowered player characters.

Another would be that Logic will always trump mechanics. I used to feel that I must either find or create a system that polices behaviour in such a way that no stupid or illogical things can happen. But realizing that most important part of the RPG “engine” is the human mind, or Logic, the responsibility for verisimilitude falls on everyone at the table. (A big reason why I prefer the OSR is the emphasis on the Human Factor)

Since introducing this to all my groups, I ceased constantly running into weird mechanical exploits that abuse or ignore the physics of the setting.

938,99,1djth8f,"OTGH: a free, rules-light rpg for on-the-go one-shots!","Hello everyone! After building a minimalist DM kit, i wanted to create a system for it, so i could play simple one-shots anywhere, with people new to the hobby!

My goal was to create a ruleset that is easy to run, that rewards narrative encounters and makes players jump into the adventure as soon as possible: character creation, skill checks and coming up with stat blocks had to be as quick and smooth as possible.

OTGH's characters only have 3 stats, but they keep their depth by rolling different dice depending on how ""in-character"" an action is: a knight might tank damage better than a rogue, but rogues are unmatched in being stealthy! Some characters might have similar sheets, but totally different roles!

The fun twist is that each stat has its own HPs, and different attacks deal different types of damage: an orc charging a barbarian isn't as scary as the same orc dealing BODY damage to a mage. A bunch of cultists might easily break a warrior's MIND, so now the wizard has to defend the party with his arcane knowledge. This mechanic forces the group to work together, to exploit the current enemy's weaknesess: an ogre might be easier to trick rather than to fight. Maybe the warlock had enough of their SOUL attacks missing, and now starts throwing punches?

The system is free on [DriveThruRpg](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/484264/OTGH-a-rpg-on-the-go?affiliate_id=2212730).

Weather is important in role-playing games. This is especially true in wilderness and seafaring exploration adventures, where poor weather can affect navigation, travel speed, and visibility. Nearly all RPGs provide some way to randomly generate weather. One of the problems with random weather tables is that they tend to be “too random”. Rolling once a day on a random weather table can result in the weather jumping unrealistically between different types (Storm! Cold Weather! Hot Weather! Storm! etc). Real weather isn’t completely random all the time. For example, mid-latitude weather tends to flip between regimes of unsettled stormy weather and regimes of settled weather. When the weather is unsettled things do indeed feel random as the passage of storms and fronts bring rain, snow, and strong winds. But when the weather is settled we can get the same conditions day after day, for example, during a summer heatwave or a winter cold spell (both of which are often associated with anticyclonic blocking conditions). 

**“Less random” random weather using a simple Markov chain**

A different way to create random weather and yet retain realistic variations is to expand on the idea of the weather flipping between “Settled” and “Unsettled” regimes using a method known as a Markov chain. The basic idea is that there is one roll per day to determine if the weather remains Settled or Unsettled, or if it flips to the other weather regime. There is then a second roll to determine the weather type. The second roll is done every day during an Unsettled weather regime to mimic the passage of storms and weather fronts. During a Settled regime, only one roll is made for the weather type, which then persists until the weather flips to the Unsettled regime again.

The tables below describe a method for generating realistic spring or fall (autumn) weather for a location similar to Southern England. Hopefully you’ll find this fairly simple to follow (or at least no more complicated than other RPG methods) - let me know in the comments.

**Spring and Fall Weather Tables**

1. Roll 1d20 each day to determine if the weather remains Settled or Unsettled, or if it changes regime.

|**Roll 1d20**|**Settled Weather Regime**|**Unsettled Weather Regime**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1-15|Weather remains Settled|Weather remains Unsettled|
|16-20|Weather becomes Unsettled|Weather becomes Settled|

2. Now determine the type of weather, which depends on regime:

For a **Settled Weather Regime**:

At the start of the regime, roll 1d20 to determine the type of Settled Weather. The type of Settled Weather persists until the weather becomes Unsettled.

|**Roll 1d20**|**Type**|**Conditions**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1-5|Cool & Foggy|No rain, morning fog then clear, calm, cool|
|6-10|Clear & Cool|No rain, clear, calm or light wind, cool|
|11-15|Clear & Warm|No rain, clear, calm or light wind, warm|
|16-20|Cloudy & Warm|No rain or light showers, cloudy, light wind, warm |

For an **Unsettled Weather Regime**:

Roll 1d20 each day to determine the type of Unsettled Weather.

943,105,196uz5q,DragonSlayer RPG - Bards,"Greg Gillespie was kind enough to forward me a pre-release copy of the DragonSlayer PDF, and I'm planning on writing up a Bard class for the system, simply because I've always liked Bards, and my first published work was a Bard class write-up in the final issue of Knockspell. Bards often seem overlooked by most OSR systems. I'm thinking probably more Skald than the usual fantasy Bard, but we'll see what evolves as I start the write-up. Time will tell.

What abilities do you expect from a Bard class? Do you expect them to be a jack of all trades, master of none? Are they loremasters? Pied pipers and charmers? A thief with an instrument? I'm curious to see what folks think and what they expect from their Bards.",osr,1705278341.0,1,718,129

945,107,1daany9,"Doppelsold, the squad based tactical tabletop RPG ","I want to show you Doppelsold, the rules set my friends and I are currently developing together! It's heavily inspired by the video game battle brothers. It is a squad based tactical tabletop RPG game that is played with two players, each controlling three separate characters called retainers. You will fight and die through a harsh medieval world filled with a great variety of monsters.

What makes us special:

* Our Doppelsold ruleset is designed for 2 players and 1 DM, so scheduling conflicts are a goner. I always wanted to play a ttrpg where you can control multiple characters and have a sense of battle between two factions. It is not fun to have one turn and then wait 30 minutes only to miss your next sword hit and have to wait again. With 3 retainers per player, 6 in total you are always in the midst of battle, always can do something, must do something. If one of them gets knocked out or stunned the others can still act. Overall you have more actions to do epic or funny things, it makes the whole game more engaging. You will care deeply for some retainers because they can become heroes and the tales of their deeds will live on even after their gruesome death. 
* Our Monsters are fun to play for the DM and have more than 1 action they can use ;). One of the weak points of the king of ttrpgs is the simplistic monster design that is not very fun to run or fight. Older editions had a more interesting enemy design with different roles and we wanted to revive that but also add to it. The most fun situations arise when you are confronted with a choice. As a player in Doppelsold you will have to make choices every moment of the game. Controlling enemies will be the same. Having a monster where you can choose from multiple actions is fun. Therefore our design goal correlates to that and our monsters have many interesting (and nasty) actions in store.
* We used the concept of morale and routing for retainers and enemies to keep fights suspenseful. It is super intense when half of your retainers flee and the fight seems already lost, but then in a last stand effort they come back and turn the tide of battle again. It is way more engaging and realistic to have enemies flee and not always fight to the death. So Doppelsold gives a more realistic depiction of combat with morale as a factor. 
* Doppelsold Weapons and Spellcasting give the player a plethora of actions from which to choose. As written before, making decisions is fun, therefore players should have options available to them, not only “I attack”.  The gear you will find determines your retainers focus and specialization (class). You can switch out the gear and turn a fighter with shield and sword into a magic focused retainer. Everybody can use every gear, mixing them is encouraged. For these purposes we designed many gear cards you can easily print. (They are very pretty!)

Here's where I'm at right now:

* It will be a d6 system similar to Maze Rats, but probably not 2d6. I'm going for a flat distribution rather than a bell curve, to make the math more transparent and easier to calculate.
* Some of my favorite parts from Knave, like item slots, will be moving over.
* Melee attacks will automatically deal damage, minus armor ratings, similar to what we see in Into the Odd. Maze Rats *sort of* did this already, but armor was so high that attacks would frequently deal 0 damage, which slowed things down.
* 36 weird, flamboyant character archtypes, like the Lantern Witch, Cauldroneer, or Skeleton King. Each gets a few fun abilities as they level. Definitely some inspiration from Troika here. HP remains fairly low and lethality remains high.
* A hugely expanded toolkit section. This was one of the big selling points of Maze Rats, so the goal is to make it even better.

948,110,1ck41j7,Slay & Plunder (OSR Sword & Sorcery RPG) Open Playtest,"For those who are up for some playtesting, I have an OSR game that is ready for outside input. It's called, Slay & Plunder. The rules are structured around B/X and should work well with other game materials that share the same lineage.

The major differences are the explicit setting, which is inspired by sword & sorcery fiction as well as  Germanic and Slavic folklore, and the dice mechanics, which are unified around the venerable d6. Specifically, a 2d6 on-or-under roll is used throughout. It's simple and consistent. It's also a natural fit for descending AC.

Other features of the rules include the following:

* Very fast character creation; not Troika fast, but fast.
* All four classes are available; cleric, fighter, magic-user, and thief.
* XP from monster kills > XP from loot. Leave no survivors.
* Spell point magic system.
* Slot based encumbrance.
* Variable weapon damages and features.
* Some entirely new (and some slightly tweaked) spells and monsters.

*Edit: To make the game more accessible, the ""Grimm"" bit has been removed. There's still plenty of bloodshed for those who are good (or not) with a bit of gore.*

I should also mention, there's no artwork and only minimal formatting at this time.

955,117,zm3br1,New to actually running OSR - Would it be fine to swap XP for monsters out for XP for gold? (Basic Fantasy RPG),"Hello! I've been scouring this sub a lot lately and I'm familiar with lots of stuff going on in the OSR scene, but my actual experience is running a whopping 2 games of Mork Borg. It was awesome, but it doesn't feel like the system to run a long term campaign (for me). 

A while back I actually played in an OSE campaign and I really disliked it at the time. But that was because I was coming from 5e only and didn't know what I was getting into. There were definitely certain aspects I liked, and it felt more ""true"" to the game because we were dungeon crawling and managing logistics - but I hated how squishy I was and was basically incapable of thinking outside my character sheet. I still like running 5e, but I've got the OSR itch, so to speak. 

I picked up a few BFRPG books and the Morgansfort module, and I'm excited to r read through and get a feel for how old school should be run. The one thing I really liked about OSE and not so much BFRPG was XP - specifically XP for gold. Which brings me to my question in the title. Also, if anyone else has any hacks they utilize for BFRPG, do share.

Anyway, I've been running a long term 5e campaign that I've tried to old school-ify but I finally realized that I should just... play an actual old school system instead of trying to beat 5e into submission.

956,118,u05zl2,What's your RPG origin story?,"I'm old enough to have played D&D during the '80s, but it didn't work out that way. I greatly enjoyed the Saturday morning cartoon, but my first direct exposure to RPGs in any form came via my lifelong love of video gaming: Dragon Warrior (aka Dragon Quest) in 1989, followed by Final Fantasy in 1990.

Not long after Final Fantasy, I came across a copy of the Moldvay basic book (all by itself) at a thrift store. I was captivated, but wanted more details and some of those crazy dice the book described.  Unfortunately, I lived in a remote ski resort town with nothing even close to a proper game store. 

Eventually, I spotted a full-page D&D ad on the back cover of a comic book and sent the attached coupon in for a free 1990 Mail Order Hobby Shop catalog. A few weeks later, I finally had my dice and was fumbling through my first game with friends, kicking off a Mystara-based campaign that would run through the end of high school.

Around this same time, I also found my way into some local AD&D 1E games run by older gamers who didn't mind having an annoying teen around every now and then. I started reading Dragon magazine (with issue 175, November 1991) and shortly thereafter purchased my first ever brand new rulebook, the D&D Rules Cyclopedia.

Then came the other games: GURPS, Shadowrun, Call of Cthulhu, West End's Star Wars, and so on. To this day, however, it's AD&D 1E and the '80s D&D lines that truly feel like home.

What's good about BFRPG?

It doesn't hurt that:

* It's free,
* all of the suppliments are free
* all of the adventures are free

Does free = good?  Not always, but I think it does in this case.

If you look on the forums of their website, you'll find that they're fairly active, especially in the workshop.  It reminds me an open source community, such as what you see in software development.   The collaborative manner in which they put together adventures and modules is really cool.

Mechanically, it is most similar to b/x, although the changes that they make are changes that I prefer.  The game works, and is very complete, with a lot of quality supplements.

One of my favorite adventures on the site is actually a collection of six or so adventures all written for a competition - which was to write an adventure for the same map.

There is a  lot more I could write, but I'll just say - check it out.

Edit: I want to also mention that the author has a history of publishing free materials, including [several free novels](https://tower.gonnerman.org/fiction/).  Really cool.

Edit 2: I have to admit that I liked the art of some other systems better, at first, but the art of this one has grown on me, to the point that I like it the best - and I like that the artists have retained their rights to use their art elsewhere, if they want.

1) we are collecting funds for publishing **Beyond Corny Groń - Adventurer's Guide**: a sandbox adventure setting in a world heavily inspired by legends from the Polish mountains, folk songs of bold highwaymen, and romantic tales about Hidden Things;

&#x200B;

2) the purpose of writing the Guide is to capture and present **Polish legends, folklore, and the mood of the Tatra and the Carpathian Mountains**, with a proper dose of **weirdness, whimsy, and adventure** in the form of TTRPG material;

3) to support these efforts, visit [the Nerd Sirens shop](https://nerdsirens.pl/sklep/gb/english/96-corny-gron.html) and buy an already-made and finely printed game, Corny Groń, a solo RPG set among the Polish mountains, where the Guide will lead you very soon. We will send it to you right away and we will use the profits from the sale to pay for illustrations, editing, design, and English translation of the Guide;

4) if, for some reason, you don’t want the printed solo game, or you want to check it out before buying—Corny Groń can be found on the [Nerd Sirens itch.io](https://nerd-sirens.itch.io/corny-gron), where you can also pay for the digital version as much as you think is right. The profits from this sale will also contribute to the budget for the ""sandbox"" Guide.

I’s quite simple, isn't it? As for the other details—the cost of publishing the Guide (the aforementioned illustrations, editing, design, and English translation) in a digital version is around 1000 euros. Any surplus will allow us to fast-start the production of the printed release (we are thinking about hard, cloth binding, and hot-stamping). Otherwise, we will cover the cost of printing from what the Guide itself collects later in itchfund.

**The Guide will contain**:

\* a mountain map generator

\* tables for random places and encounters

\* descriptions of folks, creatures, legends, and factions.

At the moment, **the Guide is about 430,000 characters of descriptions, tables, and statistics tailored for use with OSRs** (Knave, OSE) and other games similar to D&D. To capture the folklore mood, we’ve asked Ala Wiśniewska for some new hand-made linocuts, a sample of which can be found attached. By the way—**when you buy a printed Groń, you can also buy hand-made prints of her illustrations, and they will be shipped together with the printed copy of the game** ;)

I've talked about it here a few times, but lately I've been reflecting a lot on the process that lead to its final form, in terms of layout design. I've shared about this in other spaces folks have told me that was useful, so I figured I should share it here as well.

https://preview.redd.it/7uftqhjvwkfc1.jpg?width=2910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e65a6566f86af59943bdfda940e64daf108d078

  
The Lost Bay tabletop RPG is set in 199X. It hits a Suburban Gothic vibe. You're not kids on bikes. You're young adults, hot messes with weird powers. The setting is a haunted and decaying, stuck in time, where immortals and horrors roam free. The game takes inspiration from both late 80s/90s media (horror, dark fantasy) and urban cultures. Some of the playable classes hint at punks, metalheads, goths. That's why at first I was tempted to lay out the game as a punk zine from that era. That would have made so much sense. But I’ve found this option a bit too prescriptive in terms of mood. I'd like the game to have a strong flavor but to be welcoming to other folks' imagination and cultural references. 

  
Plus, let’s be honest, there’s already one Mörk Borg that draws from punk zines. It’s a stellar book, and I could hardly do as a good layout as the one Johan Nohr did.

  
So instead I picked another (art?) direction. I’ve been parsing instruction manuals from that “era”. Commodore, Atari. Electronic parts catalogs. Simple layouts, lots of whitespace. Grids, grids, grids.

What I’m trying to emulate is that black and white technical feel, like if The Lost Bay was actually a book from the mid ‘90s, and the copy you have was a badly photocopied, and partially worn out duplicate. Looks technical but it’s a bit corrupted, it’s been mutated by the dark forces at work in the game. I’m still fine tuning things but I’m happy with this balance that gives the books flavor but makes the text readable and fairly easy to structure.

  
Mothership has been another source of inspiration. Its layout design influenced TLB with two things: the choice of having black and white inners, and the way art is used throughout the books. Mothership doesn’t have “spot” art, but only cool, kick ass, explosive art. And this contributes to conveying the mood of the game so much. I’ve decided to follow a similar path, in TLB art fills at least a third of a page, when it’s present it’s super visible and informs notably the text. I hope the Kickstarter campaign will be a success and allow me to commission more art to TLB artist Evangeline Gallagher, because frankly her art does 90% of the layout.

If the books inners are black and white, the covers are in color. Cloud Empress by Watt has been highly influential in the way TLB covers are designed. With CE, Watt achieves an incredible unity throughout variety and manages to establish a strong sense of what the books are about, right from the covers. The covers are a statement: eerie world,  ‘70s flavored retro future, amazing creatures.

I’m trying to build something similar with TLB and have the three core booklet covers convey a sense of the game, establishing unified layout structure, headings, and fonts.

I'm working on something that's very 'low fantasy', non-magical, and I need traps (or trap inspiration). Because of the low fantasy/non-magical thing, said traps basically need to work in the real world (ignoring the obvious questions of why would anyone fill a dungeon with traps...).

So think - 

* Cunning uses of pits
* Mechanisms that shoot / slice / crush
* Acid, water, fire, oil - real world materials
* Pivots / deadfalls, etc

I can think of the components, but my mind isn't devious enough to come up with how to put them *together*, and I'm hoping there's a source that'll help, even if it's like, 50% of the material (e.g. Grimtooth's Traps maybe?).

For those of you who still haven't jumped into **Sacrifice**, my dark fantasy OSR game heavily inspired by **Berserk**, I've just created a PDF bundle! you can now get the core rulebook, plus the scenarios expansion and the first issue of the official zine at a discounted price! [https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/450388/](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/450388/) 

 

**Sacrifice Features:**

* An OSR D20 ruleset easily compatible with other retroclones.
* A classless character creation system, complete with skills, feats and much more.
* As a Branded, your character is above average, capable of dealing with many opponents at once and surviving what would be certain death for others. This makes Sacrifice ideal for 1-on-1 play (one GM, one PC), although standard group play is of course possible, and even solo, thanks to the full set of GM-less rules and procedures included.
* Interesting and rich combat, with critical hit and fumble tables, morale rules, exciting Combat Maneuvers, dueling, and more.
* A feudal, human-centric ruthless world with no magic but full of demonic evil and corrupted institutions, centered around No Man’s Land, a setting strongly influenced by Kentaro Miura’s Berserk, complete with gear lists, bestiary, and a gazetteer.
* Detailed travel and hex-based exploration rules, with encounter tables that change depending on the current hex’s situation: is there a battle going on? Is it a war-torn, devastated place? Is it one of the few untouched corners left in No Man’s Land? Or perhaps you found a pocket of civilization? All these affect what you can expect to find in a hex.

976,139,16dvazx,Simplifying Travel and Exploration in My Basic Fantasy RPG game – Seeking Advice,"Hey guys,

I'm just one or two sessions away in my Basic Fantasy RPG campaign from ending the current dungeon and story arc, and I wanted to chat about making travel and exploration a smoother, less complicated experience. Perhaps something inspired by [DungeonCraft's ""The Bone Road""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovuc4CHudGQ), I'm aiming for something simple and engaging without getting into the complexities of a full-blown hexcrawl.

Here's the deal: I'm not looking to slow down the game with intricate details or extensive map-making. Instead, I want to keep things moving while still capturing that OSR feel. So, I'm reaching out for some practical advice.

1. **Dealing with Random Encounters:** How do you handle those unexpected surprises during travel? Any tricks to keep them interesting but not overly complex? Was thinking of creating d30 tables depending on the area being explored. But I guess I'm drawing blanks in this regard.
2. **Time & Distance:** What are your go-to rules or methods for determining travel times between places? How do you keep distances manageable without losing immersion?
3. **Terrain & Navigation:** Do you have any ways to make different terrains and landmarks matter without diving too deep into rules and charts? How about simplifying navigation?
4. **Supplies & Resources:** Tracking provisions can be a pain. Any streamlined methods to handle this without micromanagement?
5. **Exploration Rewards:** What's your approach to rewarding players for exploring without resorting to exhaustive maps or intricate puzzles?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this or on any experiences, and any house rules or systems you've used. Let's brainstorm together to create a travel and exploration system that's both approachable and inline with an OSR feel.

Thanks a ton for sharing your insight, guys.",osr,1694230910.0,1,1842,283
977,140,184peia,PSA: LotFP has sexual violence built into the core rules,"Lamentations of the Flame Princess has >!rape, genital mutilation!< and sexual violence built into the core rules/mechanics, in the random tables in the ""Summon"" spell. Following Rules as Written, you may be ""forced"" (or at least asked) to roleplay through these acts of sexual violence.

Why post this PSA? I believe, due to the nature of sexual violence and its affect on people and society, that anything containing sexual violence should be clearly labeled as such. Especially with RPG's, where you might be asked to role-play through sexual violence, I believe that it needs to be explicitly cleared with everyone involved.

I regularly see people recommending LotFP along side Basic Fantyasy RPG, OSE, Swords & Wizardry, etc, without making it clear that LotFP has these components of sexual violence built into its core rules, and the others do not. I think a lot of people must not be aware of this, and so I'm posting this so people are aware and can make their own decisions fully informed. Again, this is not just part of the setting of LotFP, it is part of the Core Rules.

For me, it's important that I can hand a player or potential player the ""Core Rulebook"" or ""Players Handbook"" and NOT have them exposed to descriptions of >!rape or genital mutilation!<. I have friends that have been >!raped, and some that have been molested as children!<, and these kinds of descriptions and reminders are traumatizing to them. So it's important to me that they are clearly labeled.

LotFP states ""18+ Explicit Content"", but I'm guessing most people (including me), expect it to mean more ""sexual content and innuendo"" and less ""sexual violence"". I wish Raggi was more clear about what is meant by ""18+ Explicit Content"".

Just to be clear, in order to trigger these mechanics you need to have a character cast the spell ""Summon"", fail a check or two, and then roll just right on the random tables for the spell. There is a good chance most people playing LotFP have never seen these mechanics in action. Also, as a side note, the ""Summon"" spell encourages human sacrifice, in that it will provide a bonus to the caster for some of the random rolls.

The section in question is in the free ""LotFP Weird Fantasy Role-Playing - Player Core Book:Rules & Magic"" (file name LotFPRulesMagicFreeNoArt.pdf)? Here is a quote from that pdf, from under the Summon spell in the Spell Descriptions (pages 134-143, the exact quote coming from pages 141-142 in the subsection 6:""Lust of a Betrayed Lover""):

""All characters within the local area (to be deter- mined by the situation) roll 1d6. Those that roll a 1 are at fault for the situation. All characters not at fault will become allies in the drive to hunt down, subdue, >!and mutilate the genitals !<of all who are at fault. After this is done, all who are not at fault must make a saving throw versus Magic. Those who fail will seek to kill the parties at fault, and all who stand in their way of doing so. The effect ends only when all of the characters at fault have been dealt with, although they will not be hostile with any of the characters present who are not at fault , even if they were hostile or longtime enemies before Summon was cast. If nobody is at fault, then things will get ugly. All characters become obsessed and fixated on one random other character in the vicinity, and >!will attempt to have sex with that character!<—at any cost. The character will first attempt to subdue the subject of his obsession, to unconscious if he can or death if he must, before>! having his way!<. Male- female pairings will result in conception, and 10% of male-male pairings will as well. The offspring will be an otherworldly creature—use these Summon charts to determine exactly what, assuming a 1 HD creature—which will do>! 1d10 damage to a woman carrying it as it is born, 2d10 to a man!<. The effect ends for a character when >!his lust is sated!<.""

It currently is linked from [lotfp.com](https://lotfp.com) and is on DriveThruRPG

Edit: I kind of feel like those who are saying ""It's LotFP and Raggi - It should be obvious what it's going to contain"" are being purposefully obtuse. I wouldn't be surprised if LotFP is in the top 20 OSR games recommended by people on this site - but it's the ONLY game commonly recommended that contains any sexual violence in the core rules. Hence this PSA post.

Edit 2: I really dislike moralizing regarding violence in games, because I feel it leads to silly and pointless quagmires. That said, there are real world scenarios where violence can have a  pragmatic purpose. For instance, defending ones family from a murderer, or defending your country from a conquering force. But there is never a scenario where sexual violence is pragmatic - it is always sadistic, meant to tear down, subvert, violate and destroy. That is why it's treated differently.

Edit 3: This post got way more attention than I expected. I want to make it clear, I am opposed to censorship and support Freedom of Speech. This wasn't a ""call to action"", but if I was going to make a suggestion or request, it would be that when you recommend LotFP, include a warning that it contains sexual violence. You can link to this post if you want.

978,141,16rub4e,Question about creating/porting a custom race for Basic Fantasy RPG (especially from DnD 5e)?,"So I'm getting into TTRPGs. I've wanted to dabble in the OSR scene for awhile, especially since I feel it'll be a bit easier to learn with not many rules to worry about. That and it'll be good for playing solo, as well, if I wanna mess with things by myself. (BFRPG is free and has more support so thus why I'm focusing on the game here). This is more of a question for after when I'm used to handling the basic races. **My main question is this: is there a certain way of going about it? Is there a specific format to follow when creating the text description for a homebrew race?**  


**As for trying to convert an existing race** (offical/homebrew) for, say, DnD 5e, **how would I go about handling things such as traits? Should I simply add an equivalent feature in the ""Special Abilities"" section?** I know I'll also have to keep in mind making things balance so there's nothing wonky going on stat-wise (""oops, I made the wood elves too OP."").   


**So as an example**, I'm considering adding **Burmecians** (a kind of ratfolk from *Final Fantasy IX*).

The book is branded as OSRIC for legal reasons but in practice is pure “Gygaxian”1E, consisting of both my preferred fixes to various known problem areas in the 1E rules (psionics, initiative, weapon specialization, the Unearthed Arcana classes) and a ton of new material in the “old-school” spirit, some adapted from Gygax’s post-TSR games (joss, knacks & quirks, bard spellsongs), some extrapolated from things he said he wanted to do with AD&D but never got around to (new classes - mountebank, savant, etc), and some that’s original to me but strives to maintain the same feel and spirit of the 1978-83 era of the game, plus some essays and design tips. The book was compiled over many years of play and testing so everything in it is practical and play-focused. 

I can just about guarantee anyone who plays or likes 1E AD&D will find stuff here to add to their games, and people who play OSE Advanced Fantasy, Labyrinth Lord AEC, or 2E AD&D probably will as well. 5E players not so much, but maybe the material in this book might inspire you to take another look at 1E?

&#x200B;

Hello RPG lovers and fans of the macabre!

I'm thrilled to introduce you to my Kickstarter campaign for ""On the Odder Side"", a dark fantasy tabletop RPG deeply inspired by Neil Gaiman's 'Neverwhere'. Drawing on the framework of Chris McDowall's celebrated ""Into the Odd"", ""On the Odder Side"" employs the ""Mark of the Odd"" system for gameplay that's both accessible and rich in strategic depth. It's an ideal match for both seasoned OSR players and newcomers to the genre.

The game transports players to a surreal, shadowy version of our world, blending the odd and the extraordinary with elements that might feel familiar. It’s a nod to Gaiman's unique storytelling style, where the bizarre becomes the norm.

Since launching on Kickstarter, the response has been phenomenal. We've soared past our initial goals, demonstrating a real hunger for this kind of imaginative and atmospheric play.

As the creator of this project, I am passionate about building more than just a game; I aim to foster a community where fans of horror, fantasy, and role-playing can unite. Whether you're seeking a game with rich, narrative-driven adventures or something that captures the essence of classic D&D with a fresh twist, ""On the Odder Side"" offers something for everyone.

Explore the Kickstarter page for ""On the Odder Side"" and join us on this unique adventure. Your support and enthusiasm are what make this project extraordinary.

991,155,m2podo,"[knave] first rpg game ever, need some help","Hi all, I want to play first ever rpg session for me (referee) as my friends (players) this week. I have chosen Knave as a system and Tomb of the Serpent Kings as an adventure to play. During my preparation for it I got few questions, that I would like to ask you. I guess some are Knave specific, some are general to osr/rpg genere.

1. Why Quiver exist? I assume that I can keep arrows as any other items in my items slots (and stack them reasonably), so why I need quiver? Does it means that quiver and arrows in it doesn't counts as item in items slots? Can i only have 20 arrows and nothing more in my items slots?
2. How can I recover arrows? I guess in dnd you roll wisdom to collect arrows after fight, it is applicable here to?
3. AFAIK, the only place in ruleset mentioning food is ""after a meal and a full night's rest, PCs regain lost hit points..."", and then shop have table full of different foods and animals. Why should I buy i.e. bacon (10g) instead off travel ration (5g)? I guess i can add some effect to food, but why then basic travel ration exists.
4. Spells could be used only once per day, so for me it makes magic heavy character is useless, cause after each fight this character needs full night rest. Should magic heavy character depends on melee/range weapons most of the fights anyway or I'm missing something?
5. What's the cost of switching weapons/spells? In ruleset you can read that spell book must be held in both hands, but I don't know whats the cost of switching spell books during fight or changing bow for sword
6. There are different traps across whole dungeon, how do I prevent party from examining each square foot of dungeon and rolling for finding traps?
7. I'm used to from computer rpgs that dmg is heavily based on the weapon you have. In Knave all weapons that are listed are available from lvl 1, you can't progress further with your weapon dmg. I guess I'm free to create more powerful weapons, allow upgrading gear talking to blacksmith (adding modifiers etc.), are there some general rules how to make it ""correctly"" (not too strong, not too weak). Or should i rather rely rather on those basic weapons?
8. How to handle light sources in dungeon? I don't want party to go to town every hour to buy more torches, so I guess i need to place some in dungeon too, but if torches are in dungeon, why bother anyway? What happens when all light sources exhaust?
9. Some events outside fight have some aoe effects, i.e. exploding trap, but i thought that outside fight i will allow players to explore dungeon more or less freely, don't track at which exact square is each character. But this way I don't know who is in range of aoe. Should I ask them to place characters at specific places even outside fight?

I have read some other rpg books (old school essentials, whitehack ...), but didn't find answers to this type of questions.  
Thank you for all the answers, if you know any source that will help me with those questions / talk about this kind of problems during your first rpg session, please share it with me :D Thank you all!",osr,1615468048.0,1,3082,570

I have had some friends here and there pick it up but I really never got mass feedback on how to improve the system to print a second edition with corrections and balancing.

I offer it to everyone free via a download at this link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WRA9TEhyJmhutJ0u0rXlOJEZ0R6lHyKz?usp=drive_link)!

994,158,t0vk9n,"Completely New To TT RPG Players Who Want To Give ""D&D"" A Shot","Hello!

I've got a group of friends who have never played or seen anyone play table top RPGs. Completely fresh to the hobby, only hearing about it from older siblings or other friends. One of them approached me knowing that I've played and DM and asked if I would lead them in the ways of the gaming. I of course said yes. Now my only concern comes in that I don't want to play 5e. They haven't mentioned a system or anything because they truly don't know about this hobby, but for some reason my brain is telling me I should probably start them off with 5e, because that's where I started and where I've started other completely new to TT RPG groups. However it just don't get my motor running like it once did.

I've gotten really into OSR and how the games seem to play and how characters are more grounded than in modern RPGs where they become super heroes. Has anyone had experience running completely new players in an OSR game? How did it go?

I haven't play DCC but I collected a lot of the books and really want to give it a shot. Would anyone suggest not running it for a newbie group? My other system would be OSE. I've played neither, but read the rules thoroughly and really want to give it a shot. Thoughts on the matter are very much welcome.",osr,1645765510.0,1,1257,238

Reaper’s O5R RPG kickstarter is in its final day. Notes from Reaper:

  
Four Core Classes: Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, Wizard  
Four Core Folk: Human, Proudfoot Halfling, Wood Elf, Hill Dwarf  
Six Ability Scores: Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma  
d20-based Resolution System: The core of DDRPG uses a twenty-sided die. Whenever a character attempts something with interesting success or failure, the d20 is rolled and modifiers added.  
Open Skill System is based on Ability Checks - a character's Background, Folk, and Class define what sorts of Skills a PC is proficient in.  
Renovated Spell System - some spells have been revamped, improving utility and effectiveness; Spell Points allow casters to alter spell effects, increasing damage, number of targets, and degree of effect.  
Dangerous - When Hit Points are exhausted, a creature is likely to die. When Hit Points are reduced below 0, the combatant has till the end of the round to be stabilized or they die. There are no Death Saves in DDRPG.  
Easy to Use - DDRPG is compatible with almost any other RPG product. If you want to add something from a different system, it's easy to fold it into DDRPG's ruleset.   


  
My experience/additional info based on the betas over the last year or two:

  
Much like shadowdark it’s a 5e OSR take in may ways..but I think…seemingly compatible with most 5e material (I don’t feel shadow dark really is)…it’s based more on AD&D and C&C rather than something like BX.  While I don’t think they set out to attempt to fix a lot of the perceived issues some people have with the siege engine and it’s conflicts when dealing with class based skills…I think they do.  
Saves and Skill checks are ability score based checks, either proficient or non-proficient, (add level or 1/4 level) plus ability score bonus.    
Characters have one proficient stat save from their Folk, and one they choose.    
Skill proficiencies are more OSR/open in nature..it’s a combination of the folk, class and background (culture, upbringing and pre-class trade).  The game provides examples of backgrounds to select and their characteristics, but players and DMs could come up with their own.  Based on those descriptions in the book of the type of tasks the players are proficient at, the DM and Players make a game time decision if the task at hand would be proficient for the character.  In practice it’s pretty easy and fast given the examples of the types of tasks each folk/class/background would encompass.  
Spells have been reviewed and rewritten based on input from multiple revisions of TTRPGs and try to produce old school effects while taking some improvements from the modern game.  An example is find familiar…without going into too much detail, caster can share senses with the familiar up to a certain distance, death of a familiar can cause hp loss and another familiar can’t be summoned for one year…makes familiars more companions like they were in previous iterations of D&D rather than disposable tools like in 5e.  
Simplified slot based encumbrance. Movement and distance based on paces so that it works well with either grid or theater of the mind.  Armor with max dex bonus similar to 5e, weapons with some 3e/5e/C&C characteristics like finesse, penetration, versatile..etc.  
Overall the attempt was to take elements from many D&D versions, games like C&C and others and put together a good mix of fast game play at the table with some modern lessons learned.  I suppose it will be up to individual opinion on if it’s the right mix for you..they’ve been play testing it and developing for quite a long time however.  For me I think it will be my go to now if people want to play 5e material or a more modern game with a unified mechanic. I still like C&C but I’ve had too many people voice their dislike of siege engine (Trust me..like many of my other RPGs…I’ll personally still play a lot of C&C).  For years I’ve wanted to merge many of the ideas from 5e with C&C that I like for a game that is more my tastes but I’ve been too lazy to do that…these guys did it for me and they have nice quality traditionally bound and printed books to boot, which would be far better than my printed word doc of house rules.",osr,1700334135.0,1,4533,721

Ok, so...

I've been playing RPGs for more than 15 years now (3.5 and CoC 6e were my first games), and I started diving like a maniac into the OSR and retro-clones and the history of the hobby for the past 5+ years.

I write my own campaigns and adventures that I usually play with the same friends, but since I discovered the OSR, I've been teaching more and more people about the hobby, both in-person and online. Because of this, I've been taking notes of what new players understand and expect from an RPG. I write down notes about what makes sense to them and what doesn't, and I just keep improving the way I approach to new players to ease their experience. I've been a language professor for years, that's what I'm used to.

This mix of teaching the hobby to new players plus learning about the history of the hobby and game design resulted in this game I called ""Crepitant"". It's actually more like a series of system-agnostic guidelines that you can learn to adopt in your own group, but everything came from this idea of trying to ""make sense"" out of the original rules that conceived the hobby many years ago, but also adapt them into something that ""make sense"" for players that are just gamifying a story being told, without being too overwhelming. I didn't want yet another retro-clone, nor a game that keeps teaching the same game mechanics/design choices for ""modern readers"". I wanted to modernize the core itself.

This PDF right here is justa teaser. The final book will be published in 2024, containing guidelines for Players and Game Masters; a Bestiary, and a Grimoire.

If you want to stay up to date, consider following **CREPITANT**’s official [**YouTube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl39umVEsog-diVKE1u96xQ) or the author’s [**DriveThruRPG**](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/24027/carlos-castillo-davalos) profile.

999,164,yhmjnd,errant rpg,"I like the concept of having simple mechanics yet a plethora of ""procedures"" as it is called in the book, meaning it is easy to pick up and use, but it covers a wide range of things that may well never come up in play, but should they come, there an out of the box solution for something instead of having to house rule something.

How is that concept to you? Isn't making things up on the spot in the spirit of osr? Part of the reason I entirely skipped anything related to 3.5 is because there were just so many rules, and adnd for that matter now that I remembered it. What is your take on this?

While I'm not too familiar with either of the systems, as I haven't had the opportunity to run them in a game, savage worlds compares to it somewhat. Simple resolution, plenty of modular rules and stuff that cover a wide range of applications and situations. Is errant just osr flavoured swade?

1000,165,it4i9s,OSR-Wargaming RPG - Are there any OSRs that focus more on the strategic aspects of play?,"**TL;DR:** How to have a strategic level of play with large armies if your PCs have their own armies?

I've been watching and reading some OSR theories on ""Combat as War, not Sport"", and was thinking how it would be possible to run a more ""wargame"" style of combat with your PCs as commanders of units. After all, how would you assault a keep with tens of thousands of guards with just 4 PCs and some Hirelings? Wouldn't you want to lay siege to it, poison its wells, redirect its rivers, burn their food sources, pillage their lands, and so forth? Aren't things easier if you have an army to do things for you?

Sure, we could handwave all of it and say, ""Your army begins sieging the castle"" and roll some dice - but won't that just be similar to normal D&D with ""roll to spot the trap"" or ""roll to explore the dungeon""?

What do you think? Are there OSRs that handle this kind of strategic level of play? With large armies and maybe miniatures? How would you do it? How could we do it so that the PCs are still the main focus of the campaign?

P.S. I understand we can just simplify it and say ""roll to do this"". But if your players want rules, mechanics, or ideas for it, how would you go about doing it? How can we make it more interactive and ""OSR"" - if the Principia Apocrypha is to be followed with the amount of interaction we need.

**Edit:** To tie it with ""Combat as War"", since you wouldn't balance encounters and you'd assume that the keep they're assaulting has thousands of soldiers - how would you attack the keep then? If 4 PCs can assault that keep, why hasn't anyone done it? Why haven't their enemies done it?

* Skill die system (skills rated from 0, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and added to your skill check)
* Simple 'traveller' style character creation system with 6 backgrounds
* Resource management aspect
* Equipment slots and token system (things to cut out and stick on your character sheet)

1017,182,14ngagq,"Review of the greatest OSR Brazilian RPG, OLD DRAGON 2."," 

Hail guys. Old Dragon, the biggest OSR RPG in Brazil., funded last year in 48 minutes, and having achieved several goals. 

It was released in its first edition as an attempt by the creators to have the same experience they had before the bunch of combos brought by 3a. Inspired by the Basic Fantasy experience, the authors independently edited and published a book of 150 pages, with four races, four classes and tools to play up to level 20. It was the first OSR RPG in Brazil and had as its main characteristics: unified save roll, separate races and classes, and specializations (explained later) plus 3rd edition number parameters like stat modifiers 17, +4, and ascending armor classes above 30 for the most epic enemies. 

After 10 or 12 years, changing the way RPGs are written and detecting certain things that could be improved over time, the second edition of this beloved RPG from Brazil was announced, with a unique community in the amount of content produced and collaboration between its members. The new edition was successfully funded in less than an hour (48 minutes) in a crowdfunding format, gaining support from 1322 people, in various digital and physical formats, on FC and Late Pledge. 

The Basic Book is provided free of charge in pdf format, in addition to the SRD being free and easy to consult (<https://olddragon.com.br/livros/srd/>), and the physical hardcover book has an affordable price, much more accessible than the original RPG corebooks in the current edition. 

This analysis aims to analyze the characteristics of the basic book (lLB1), free in pdf, and the expanded rules book (LB2). 

The core book (LB1) has rules up to level 10 Corebook 2, Expanded Rules has rules from level 11 to 15, in addition to dominance rules and mass battles.

OLD DRAGON A RETROGOLEM

Old Dragon is not intended to be a retroclone, but an amalgamation of the best options already presented by several editions of the original Rpg up to advanced 2 in search of the best that one has of this experience in a game. So the core of the system follows this d&d like pattern, and that's why I'm going to talk about what it's different from. Starting with its unique and exclusive concept: Specializations.

SPECIALIZATIONS

Specializations are archetypes that represent different hero concepts than the basic four: fighter, rogue, mage, and cleric, but that fit them. Barbarians are fighters, illusionists are wizards, and assassins are thieves. A specialization streamlines the game and makes its application easier. They share with the base class: hit dice, number of spells per day, number of protection rolls, and have a different XP table, presented in the base class table. So you gain time and agility, in addition to having support from the base class for the creation of any specialization. In the core book we have the barbarians and paladins, as specializations of warriors. Scholar and Druid as cleric specializations; illusionist and necromancer as wizard specs and bards and rangers as thief specs. Specializations can be chosen during character creation and while the character is still at first level.

SEPARATE RACE AND CLASS, BUT WITH THAT STRESS FOR THE RACE AS A CLASS

In addition to all these options, specializations give you enough structure and freedom to create your own, and the ones that caught the most attention in this second edition are the specializations that honor races as a class in the BX and Cyclopedia editions. We have the dwarf adventurer, a warrior specialization exclusive to dwarves, halfling adventurer, thief specialization exclusive to halflings, and elf adventurer, wizard specialization exclusive to elves. Each of these specializations represent, in their honor, the most typical and outstanding examples of their class, with powers and abilities that reflect a classic icon of that class. Want race as a class? Use them. And best of all, they do not exclude the use of other specializations. A group can have an elf adventurer, mixed fighter and mage, and an elf warrior, each with their own focus. There are many, good and meaningful character options.

WARRIORS

Warriors have dv d10, with a +1 attack bonus at each level, to a maximum of +15 at level 15, the game's maximum level. In addition, he has the attractive parry abilities, where he is able to sacrifice a shield or weapon to nullify all damage from a successful attack before the damage is rolled. A true hitting machine, but still deadly, like any old school character.

CLERGY

Clerics have seen a huge improvement in how their skills work. Possessor of divine spells, it can replace any previously memorized spell with Cure Wounds, and besides, here's the best version of warding off undead you'll ever see: When performing the turn undead maneuver, the cleric forces the undead to make a morale check. The morale check, like the classic one, is made in 2d6. If the undead fails andthe results fall in equal numbers (1 and 1, 3 and 3, and etc) the undead turns to dust. Goodbye tables. According to one of the creators, this, in addition to speeding up the game, has probabilities strangely coincident with the classic table, being only necessary to adapt the moral value of the living dead, which was done in the bestiary, the third basic book. DV d8.

WIZARDS

Mage is the most misunderstood class in OSR games. A glass cannon that after firing its shot becomes a 1d4 life fret. To remedy this, mages have more starting spells, plus the ability to Read and Detect Spells, making them more useful overall. DV d4.

THIEF ABILITIES

Following the premise of improving what can be improved, and listening to the community, thieves skills have had their tests changed to d6, in addition to the evolution progression of these skills being customizable. The thief takes 2 to each of his abilities, +2 points, and + his Dexterity modifier as starting points. At levels 3, 6 and 10 he gains 2 more points. The maximum level of a thieves skill is 5, and to succeed on a check requires less than or equal. Ranger and bard have different abilities, but with the same mechanical functioning as the thief since they are archetypes that fit under the umbrella of the thief. The DV of thieves and their specializations is d6.

SAVING THROWS

The saving throws have been merged into 3, and a number related to level and class follows. To this base number we add the Wisdom or Dexterity or Constitution modifiers and we have the three saving throws of their respective attributes. To unify roll under tests, saving throws follow this model, and therefore this value increases across levels. All classes start with the base number 5, and a successful check is achieved by rolling a die and getting a value less than or equal to it.

ARMOR CLASS

Armor class is ascendant, and instead of tables and thaco we have the beautiful BA. Unlike some, to succeed in an attack you must have a result greater than your AC. The draw is on the defense.

RACES

The races have a template similar to the advanced second edition, by more classic standards. They all have some benefit on one of the saving throws, in addition to other classic benefits, such as dwarves hitting ogres and the like easier, elves doing more damage with a bow, and halflings with thrown weapons. As humans are the class that have the fewest benefits, they gain an additional 10% of all XP. 

APPEARANCE, FEATURE AND HISTORY

The core book has solid content, not just the basics of character creation, race, class, equipment, combat, and magic. There is a chapter devoted to providing tables to enrich any character, GM and player alike. These options are further enriched with core book 2, which features more customization options, a more detailed background, and an excellent flashback history option, where we discover the character's background during the game, while also filling out some of the character's skills. character.

FUNCTIONAL LOADING SYSTEM

The load system is intended to maintain the need to manage resources, characteristic of the old school, while making it desirable and as simple as possible. The load system assigns a load value to each object that represents its weight and the difficulty of carrying it. Weapons and armor, take up 1, 2 or 3 charge depending on weight/size. Other equipment takes 1 charge per kilo. Coins occupy every 100 pieces, 1 charge. A character who has a backpack adds +5 to his maximum load. A character's maximum encumbrance rating is the greater of Strength and Constitution. Simple and functional, they did it.

INITIATIVE

Test of wisdom or dexterity. Who passed acts before the enemies. Those who did not pass, act later. Ready. =\]

MOVEMENT IN HEXES

The system features a simple version instead of hex distance calculations. Each character has a movement value, usually 9. This value can decrease due to overload. When the system deals with hex movement scale, it considers that a 6km hex costs x movement points. Each character has their movements in points to travel per day. More difficult terrain costs a greater amount of movement points. So, forget about counting distances. You have 9 movement points to spend, and on this table are the movement costs. What do you do?

TEST ADJUSTMENTS

Tired of consulting what the test modifier is, whether +1, +3, +2 depending on each situation? Your problems are over. All tests have unified settings. The adjustments are: easy +2 on rolls, very easy +5, hard -2, very hard -5. An advantage cancels out a disadvantage. This applies to combat, ability checks, and saving throws. Simple guidelines for arbitrating the argument mentation and narrative development of a task that has significant consequences for the game.

MASTER'S SECTION

This section has extensive solid material for GMs to run their games, especially useful for beginners, and excellent content for reviewing their games based on common sense and fun. Here is the clear adage of ""change the rules if it makes your game more fun"". A generator of dungeons and adventures that make you play easily even without preparation.

MAGIC ITEMS

Not just the classic old school items, but also guidelines and tables for generating new and unique items to surprise those players who have already read everything. 

MONSTERS

The core book features the most iconic classic monsters, plus an exclusive and traditional system: the pygmy fungus and its hair, valuable tobacco herb.

DESIGN NOTES

Throughout the book there are explanatory notes on why the rules are the way they are, how to use or change them to achieve another result, or to tailor the game to your group.

APPENDIX

Here's another shining moment from the book. This index, organized alphabetically, references the rules in both books, the core book and the expanded rule book. So you can pick up any of the books for reference and you'll know where to find what you need, even if it's not in that book.

COMPATIBILITY

Old dragon is directly compatible with everything published up to the second advanced edition of the original roleplaying game. Parameters can be converted but the amounts of power are basically the same. Attribute adjustments have a maximum of +3, the attack bonus has a maximum, for players, of +15, if you are a warrior. The armor class of the strongest creatures goes up to 21. You'll need to convert the club or AC by subtracting 20, and warriors here are real warriors, closer to the advanced version of the original rpg game. With that in mind, it's much easier to convert and take that classic adventure to the table with this system. 

CONCLUSION

For some time Old Dragon had ended their releases. A lot was launched and the public clamored for the compendium, a legendary book never released that would give extra rules, the demand for this book lasted for years and years, it was even written and came out as a B-side document to be downloaded around. However, this additional rule took so long that perhaps it lost its importance, since the game already gave you rules to play up to level 20. In the meantime, everyone had already made do with their house rules The decision to remake the system and rewrite everything based on feedback from players updated the way the system was written. We see that it is the same system, but updated and improved, and with the advantage that the advanced rules have already been released together with the basic book, not missing from the consumer at any time. I plan to touch points in these advanced rules in the future. The main virtues of the system are: solidity and accessibility. The old dragon pdf was always free, if you wanted you could buy the physical book. This one, by the way, always very accessible, showing the publisher's commitment to popularize the hobby. The physical quality of this new edition is impeccable: color illustrations for the most important parts, such as the cover, chapter openings, references to races and classes. It is worth noting that the printing house where it was printed is known for the quality of its products, being the only one in Brazil authorized to print the original rpg books in their fifth edition. Old dragon proposes to provide you with an rpg experience already consolidated by decades of playtest, experience that was lost from the 3rd edition and was never recovered. It does this successfully, however, without being a copy and paste of old systems, but rather, the use and affirmation of those things that have worked for so long, but excluding what never worked (robbery in % for example). The best things from that old gaming experience have been preserved. The worst, removed. And everything in the game is modular, you can change the charge, magic, initiative rule without breaking. Its core has been playtested for over ten years, and changes from the latest version have been through 2 years of playtesting with the community. The system has improved, maintained its virtues: solidity and accessibility, and successfully manages to give you the old-school experience, without philosophizing about the natural nature of the dialectical agency of the emergent narrative of the OSR rpg and giving you, instead, fun, exactly as it used to be.

Some time ago, I came across **HERE'S SOME FUCKIN' D&D**—a micro RPG that's been floating around the internet for a while. (In fact, [here's a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4066um/heres_some_fuckin_dd/) on Reddit about it from five years ago.) I've run **HSFD&D** tons of times at bars, barbeques, picnics, and camping, and I was such a huge fan that I rebuilt it from the ground up. I posted updates in various subs off and on over the last few years and always got great feedback. But after working on it for so long, I've realized it's not at all the same game anymore. With that said, I bring to you **LET'S FUCKING PLAY AN RPG: An RPG for when you just want to fucking play.**

**LFPARPG** is a beer and pretzels micro RPG that doesn't take itself seriously. It's perfect for bars, barbeques, picnics, camping, or anywhere else you can sit down for an hour and roll some dice. Put a copy of it inside a pencil box with some index cards, golf pencils, and dice and you have an RPG you can take anywhere. My plan is to release the final version on my Itch.io for free, along with some $1 supplements.

~~But before that, I need help! It's been sitting in my head for so long, I would really~~ *~~really~~* ~~appreciate some critical eyes to look over it.~~

It's coast was settled by nine petty kingdoms that skirmished over the land's rich resources, but the wild interior remained untamed.   80 years ago armies of a previously-unknown hobgoblin empire arrived and conquered.  30 years ago, a civil war in the hobgoblin heartland gave the subjugated peoples a chance to win their freedom and drive the hobgoblins back... but at great cost.  Now, civilized settlements dot the coast and struggle for survival and adventurers are once again drawn to this wild frontier land by the promise of riches and glory to be found in the wilds and ancient ruins of the interior.

Weird Stone & Sorcery RPG!,"Primal Quest - Essentials, my latest game and project I will be focusing primarily for a while, has been released in print by Exalted Funeral with a accompanying introductory adventure called The Cave of Our People and a few 3rd Party releases.

This is a game of sword and sorcery in a mythical stone age with dinosaurs, aliens, elder gods, and much more.

The system draws both from the OSR and from games such as FATE, Genesys, Barbarians of Lemuria, Into the Odd, Cortex Prime (and probably more stuff). It still plays very much in the spirit of the famous Quick Primer for Old School Gaming (https://www.lulu.com/shop/matthew-finch/quick-primer-for-old-school-gaming/ebook/product-3159558.html), and fits perfectly into the principles of Principia Apocrypha (https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html). Which means it’s a game that challenges the player and not their character sheet; it is suitable and prone to open world and adventures; it has a core and sturdy system but do not try to have a rule for absolutely every situation imaginable (rulings not rules), and all that stuff we know and love.

The reception has been really good so far! I am excited! There’s already a few supporting projects in development for it, including a solo/GMLess supplement, a character generator supplement with additional options and tools, a set of adventures by a fello Brazilian writer, and some other secret stuff!

1028,195,16zp3wv,New DM Whisperer milestone reached (open source tool for authoring and running rpg sessions),"Hello and thank you in advance for reading this.

My name is Max, I'm a DM (OSR being exactly my cop of tea) and I have been developing an open source webapp named DM Whisperer (DMWHisper) for the past few months.

**What does this app do?**

In short, it allows you to create an RPG session from scratch, composed by:

\- rich text content pages, allowing copypasta from Word and similar apps.

\- tables, with several smart features like rolling on multiple tables at once, tables that reference other tables, browsing the entire table instead of rolling upon it..

\- nested levels of menus to give structure to the above content items

&#x200B;

One month ago I posted the last update on development and here I am again.

&#x200B;

What happened during this month in DM Whisperer development land?

&#x200B;

**First off, the authoring section has been greatly expanded.**

\- CKSource kindly donated a CKEditor 5 license and now this is the default content editor.

This means, among other things, that you can copy and paste from Word, HTML sites etc. 

Yes, images and layout included!

\- You can now Cut, Copy and Paste single nodes or entire content subtrees. 

It's now super easy to copy and move content around.

&#x200B;

**The import / export section has been also expanded.**

\- Now you can import and export content as a JSON file instead of relying entirely on the clipboard.

\- You now have five internal slots to save your content so that you can switch on the fly between, say, this week session that's already done but you want to rehearse before the session, and next week session that you're still preparing.

\- It's now also possible to distribute your session together with the app, by using the following URL scheme:

<url of the DM Whisperer webapp>?datafile=<url of the json data file>

(this is useful if you decide to host DM Whisperer on your web space)

&#x200B;

**The content browsing section (the one you use during the session with your players) has been greatly expanded as well.**

\- First off, the rich text now makes it easier to read your content.

Plus, you can put links into your content for, say, launching content such as background music when your party reaches some kind of milestone.

\- You now have persistent bookmarks (five of them)! This way you can switch, with one tap, between a submenu with some handy tables, the next story scenes, NPC sheets etc.

\- You can navigate between content pages at the same level, without getting back to the submenu (much like reading book pages)

&#x200B;

**If you're not a developer, click on this link to run the app in your browser (works best with smartphones and tables, but runs great also on PCs and Macs):**

[https://www.marsiglietti.it/dmwhisper/](https://www.marsiglietti.it/dmwhisper/)

Note: the app is installable (for free) from the above site as a Progressive Web App.

Also note that the app comes with some example content, that's not really useful for your session. You are supposed to provide your own content.

&#x200B;

If you need help creating content, you can contact me here on Reddit. Eager to help!

**Sources for this app are on GitHub**: [https://github.com/maxmars/dmwhisper](https://github.com/maxmars/dmwhisper)

(If you like this open source webapp, please ""star"" it on the GitHub page)

Thank you in advance for your suggestions and for using DM Whisperer!

Plot Summary:

Flex, Ignatious, and Norage get acquainted at the Firebreathing Kittens' commissary and guild hall, while looking at the notice board, where they find a job from Edmas Thomison's Eastinghouse corporation to retrieve a sample at nearby Lake Carashe for a large sum of gold. After the initial hesitation due to bad blood between Thomison and thew Cogbright family, Nulisag reveals that the job is already pre-paid. Seeing an opportunity to double-cross the double-crosser, Ignatious wholeheartedly accepts the mission.

Norage, recognizing the lake to be a quick walk away from the Eight Paths Monastery, offers to navigate while Flex provides a mech for a quick transport option. The intrepid heroes make it to the gates of the Monastery, which have doors blown off hinges and show signs of a struggle, but no sign of life.

After running into the main courtyard and smelling blood, Norage runs to the quarters of Master Malakkus XXIV to make sure he is okay. On the way, the group gets ambushed by a gang of strangely floppy and rabid otters, who nearly take down Norage before being dispatched by the group. In Malakkus' quarters, the gang finds the sign of a struggle and decide to look for Eight Paths monks to get the full story. Slowing their pace after a few run-ins with traps, the gang comes to the main mess hall, where orders urged the monks to find shelter in a panic room.

As the gang follows Norage through the halls again, they come across a puzzle trap that requires using four of the Eight Paths to open it. Norage forgets which color aligns to which element and performs meditative combat with his hulking forge hammer as Ignatious and Flex quickly solve the puzzle, opening the doors to reveal Malakkus and the monks.

The groups exchange pleasantries as Malakkus mentions that there may be weapons testing going on that is not of the monks' creation. After making sure the monastery and its inhabitants are safe, the gang heads to Lake Carashae. The lake itself seems normal, however the gang soon finds out that the crystal-clear water is not a place they want to be in. As the party deliberates on what exactly Thomison wanted as ""a sample"", an alligator ascends and snatches Flex from shore.

The party fight it out with the alligator, who very nearly kills Flex. Luckily, Flex's Momma intervenes via dream sequence and returns vitality to Flex, who is able to see the combat through at the cost of a foot and ankle. The party decides that the water will be circulated into the larger water system and diluted out in a few days' time, and that Thomison should absolutely not have his hands on the strange water. The gang fills samples with normal well water and some other choice bodily fluids as a crass declaration against the Eastinghouse company.

Later on, Thomison consults with a mysterious being named Azmodeth that manifests as the fire in the hearth. Seemingly none the wiser about the quality of the samples, he ruminates on them with Azmodeth, who mentions that ""The Charming Chabin"" has been used, and the end of their contract may come sooner rather than later.",osr,1684930689.0,1,3843,598

Even in Poland only few people know that in 1990, around the publication of the short stories titled simply ""The Witcher"" Sapkowski wrote first an article, and then a full fledged RPG game system named ""*Oko Yrrhedesa*"" (**The Eye of Yrrhedes**).

&#x200B;

# Publication history

1990 - Monthly SF magazine ""**Fenix**"" in 1990, as a few pages consisting of basic rules and a play example.  
1994 - Monthly RPG magazine ""*Magia i Miecz*"" (**Magic & Sword**), as an expanded version of the rules from Fenix, including new Game Master's Sourcebook and a chapter on magic and spells.  
1995 - standalone, in small format (A5), titled simply ""***Oko Yrrhedesa***"". It included expanded rules, written by other people, and two adventures: a dungeon crawl about the titular ""Eye of Yrrhedes"" and a kind of ""river-crawl"" campaign ""*Yarra - Rzeka Śmierci*"" (Yarra - the River of Death) written by Sapkowski himself. It was illustrated by a popular fantasy illustrator **Jarosław Musiał**.  
1999 - second printing of ""*Oko Yrrhedesa*"", this time in even smaller book format \[all pictures in this article come from this book\].

[Chapter 1: For Those, Who for the First Time...](https://preview.redd.it/6d0ouftmn3h41.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca0b5400d0b651bc52a0671b4be08a3dc601cfb1)

# Historical Context

When Sapkowski was publishing ""the Eye"" in Fenix, Poland was still recovering from communism. American pop culture was exploding among young people. SF & Fantasy magazines, while still present during earlier years, were booming; people wanted to read and write sword & sorcery adventure stories. Suddenly fantasy tabletop games, either imported (legally or not) or designed by eager polish fans were available for everyone.  


In late 80's Polish board game company ""*Sfera*"" (Sphere, meaning also a ""plane of existence"" in polish) obtained rights to 2nd edition of Talisman game from Games Workshop. It's worth mentioning, that the Polish edition was the only one in the world, that had original art - everything: the boards, cards, characters had new (and many consider - better than original) illustrations. Sfera even made their own expansion for the game: the Cave. While the story of polish editions of Talisman is an interesting history in it;s own rights, suffice to say - Poland was extremely hungry for fantasy games.  


Still, we had no polish RPG as of yet, not mentioning polish editions of D&D or any other game.  


In this void, Sapkowski, who was slowly rising as the most famous fantasy writer in Poland at the time, must have had contact with D&D around late 1980's. And decided to introduce the basic idea to the readers of ""Fenix"".

&#x200B;

[Chapter 3: Game Master's Sourcebook](https://preview.redd.it/xtwpn9tkn3h41.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b60057eb03ec7fef11bcdd769d3c1624e1bd512f)

# The Game Itself

The Eye of Yrrhedes is a very, extremely simple game. Sapkowski focuses mostly on the method of the game, the playstyle more then rules (an approach I'd eagerly call OSR-like). In long, often fictionalized paragraphs he tries to explain the idea of a ""game of imagination"" to Polish reader for the first time in history.  Let me try to translate for you one such passage from the very first page of the book:  


>Thursday, half past five in the evening. ""Teleexpress"" just ended in the TV. Outside a tram rumbles by, two floors below a neighbour is drilling holes. You and three of your friends sit around a table...  
>  
>Smoke, smoke from a huge fireplace stings the eyes. The light is dim, scarcely lit by oil lamps. Ale is frothing inside clay mugs. A murmur of voices around, the inn is full. A group of dwarven miners sit around the next table, playing dice after a hard day's work at the silver mine. Warmth. Weariness.  
>  
>""Don't sleep, Corwin"" says Arebell, slamming against the table with the pommel of her dagger. She means you.  
>  
>""I'm not sleeping"" you answer. ""I was lost in though"". Don't get lost in thought.  


So, yeah, most of the time, Sapkowski again and again tries to make sure everyone understands the basic feature of a roleplaying game. He mentiones many times that the game is supposed to ""simulate reality"", and that the Game Master is tasked with making the game fair.

Beyond the theory the game mechanics are pretty simple and uses only d6 (in 1990's it wasn't easy to get any other dice in Poland). Five stats: Condition (2d6+12), Strength (1d6+6), Dexterity (1d6+6), Intelligence (1d6+6), Combat Prowess (mathematical average of Strength & Dexterity, +1 if equals 10-11, and +2 if equals 12). This, plus equipment. That's it.  


[full character sheet of Corwin](https://preview.redd.it/0wxlq8jon3h41.jpg?width=1985&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c88b54ff4c0fc2e7e11911f44a593db94f72b06)

It's worth mentioning that Sapkowski, being a writer and storyteller didn't do a great job building the game or making it approachable. Even the character creation process is fictionalized while breaking the fourth wall at the same time, which makes the rules somewhat lost in narrative.  


There is a several pages long gameplay example and this makes the game shine. Characters (and their players) are interesting and have cool, creative ideas and funny one-liners. That's Sapkowski for you.  


The whole game has no setting. It's about ""fantasy heroes in fantasy world"". The book is written with the dungeon crawling in mind, and up to this day is the only Polish RPG written with such mindset.  


&#x200B;

# Effect

Many Polish grognards started their adventure with RPG with ""The Eye of Yrrhedes"". But the ""success"" of the game was short, for soon another fantasy RPG game, created by other people debuted: the highly convoluted fantasy moloch of game inspired by AD&D named ""*Kryształy Czasu*"" (Crystal of Time). It had more rules (many, many, many more, to the point of being nearly unplayable) and it quickly became no.1 in Poland for next few years.  


Sapkowski never mentioned ""the Eye"" later on, never thinking about updating it, probably thinking that the game has ""done it's job"" introducing the idea of RPG to Polish fans. ""Oko Yrrhedesa"" remains a short and quite forgotten little gem of the history of Polish RPG.  


And if someone would ask me about any Polish OSR material, I'd point at ""Oko Yrrhedesa"", and nothing else.

1041,208,lverxe,Would You Like to See Your Creations in a tabletop RPG? *Self-Promotional Stuff Inside*,"I’m Joe and this last October myself and two others were lucky enough to have our first tabletop RPG project, Acheron, funded on Kickstarter. One of our community members put forward the idea of a creature creation competition. So we wanted to open up our community to others and give everyone an opportunity to take their favorite self-made creature and add it to our book with some sweet illustrations too. Also if you have any friends who would be interested please share! This is open to any and all and we really just want to get people excited in general about the awesome things they’ve created. This is open to any/all.

**A bit about Acheron:**

Acheron is a dystopian world with technology similar to the 1930s-1940s. A singular Government tries to keep a hold over its people while Anarchist sentiment rises, deadly beasts roam the countryside, and powerful factions vie for control.

It is a world where magic is real, but denied or unknown to most. Government conspiracies are rampant though only real half the time. Powerful Mancers walk the streets, able to destroy city blocks with a blink, but most just want a simple life. Unions form and are crushed under the heavy boot of corporate interests. Factions dance around each other looking for a kill. However, through all of this, technology and civilization are booming. The curtain over history put in place by the Government since it’s rise has been drawn back. Many people on the brink of losing their identities are now free to learn who they are and where they come from. Yet the world braces for the Government's true plans to come to light, because this must just be another conspiracy. Right?

Acheron is heavily inspired by the works of George Orwell, the Dishonored and Thief franchises, the SCP foundation, Eldritch horror, and old school monster/scifi flicks.

**Competition:**

We are happy to announce that, through a generous donation from The Monster and Anomaly Preservation Society, we will be including several fan documented creatures in our Acheron core rule book (CRB) bestiary section. If you have seen, heard, or better yet fully analyzed a creature you wish to be documented please submit a full report by reviewing the information and following the steps below. We look forward to reading your submission!

* Click on either the “Creature Creation Competition Info” button on the main page or “Download Beta” button in the upper right.
* Sign up for our newsletter
* An Acheron Beta PDF with useful information and full rules document will be emailed to you! (Check your spam/promotions folder, sometimes these emails get lost).

If you have any questions please email us at [info@darkworldstudios.net](mailto:info@darkworldstudios.net)

We can’t wait to see what everyone comes up with! Happy documenting and we look forward to reading your full report.

EDIT: We made a mistake. We've updated our competition to include payment for the finalists and clarify the fact that we won't own anything that's not selected/paid for. Hopefully there are some people that will find this competition fun, since that's what it was meant to be from the start.

1043,210,1jcnc7i,In defense of Keep on The Borderlands (and also a defense of Humanoid enemies),"I came across a thread a few weeks ago and I’ve been ruminating on my thoughts for a while. The thread is locked so I couldn’t reply right then and there and I’m not sure where I even saw it or who this response is to but oh well, here I am.

 The main gist was “why run keep on the borderlands? It’s boring, none of the enemies are interesting and they don’t even name any of the NPC’s.” Other people replied but no answer was sufficient (in my or the OP’s opinion.) 
I believe that KOTB is the perfect module to get someone to DM. That was the main purpose in the first place. The area is quite large with a lot of interesting little areas and room for the DM to flex their creativity. It leaves quite a bit open to slot into any campaign.

Aside from the faction play that really makes the caves of chaos so fun, having humanoids be the first real enemies allows both the players and the DM to understand the motives, tactics and mindset of what you are fighting. Big pig face dude and sneaky little boys are much easier for someone new to both TTRPGs and fantasy as a whole to understand than say, a gibbering mouther or xorn. 

We’ve had decades upon decades of iterations on ttrpgs, lots of new creations and creativity on the scene and we are in an absolute deluge of new options. Why complain about the origins of the hobby?That’s where most of this started for a metric butt ton of people. Of course it’s tropey. It created the tropes! 

I guess I’m going to end this with a question. Other than time constraints, why does it seem like there are a lot of people who don’t understand that this is a game of imagination? Why are some people seemingly allergic to deviating from the books and making it their own? (And just to add some inflammatory statements, this question also goes for the Hispanic coded Orcs in the 5e art. If you don’t like it, don’t add it. You aren’t beholden to the creator’s vision because once the book is yours, it’s your book. You’re the creator now.)

EDIT: I’m not sure if it was even in this sub. It may have been in r/rpg. All I know is that it popped into my feed and I don’t have the knowledge or resources to find it again. But yes, there are people who don’t like kotb.

1052,220,113ub1l,Lost RPG System,"I'm trying to locate a system I found a year or two ago. It was one of the OSR-adjacent games designed around a diceless premise, named for a specific demon monster that the referee was said to be specifically playing.

Central mechanical conceit was that the PCs autofail any attempted dangerous action unless they created an in-world advantage or could argue convincingly for why they already had an advantage. So basically the OSR principle that combat is uber-deadly and requires clever player engagement to win was hard-coded into the rules.

**Plot Summary:**

Kassie, Horatio, and Dash keep watch in the guild hall when a minotaur enters and leads them to a black carriage for a job offer to steal from the Safiosi family mafia.

The party arrives at the Safiosi casino where they sneak in through the kitchen, make a plan to get past the guards and make it to the vault. Dash takes the form of the Head Chef to get in. Kassie meets up with Kaloom Bimbo, who is a ""changed man"". Horatio helps the party charm past the guards and make it to the high stakes, high rewards area. Their disguises work, allowing them to meet up with Cameron Boneire and get him to help them get into the monitor room. Horatio made ""mixed drinks"" that allowed Cameron to win his game of cards, and receive the ""seedling"" as his prize. The monitor room held a puzzle that they passed through to enter the vault. Inside was gold, and the thing they had been sent to steal... the Golden Goose. After successfully escaping the casino with the Goose and a nurse, the party was paid for their troubles and went back to the guild.

Kassie started a nature reserve for the goose, Dash had his memory wiped and now believes his name to be ""Squash"", and Horatio revealed at the end that they were working with the Montaleoni family and was actually in disguise, secretly a lizard-type being.

1054,222,av2qtf,RPG scenes with OSR-quality and OSR's stylistic cousins,"While woefully inexperienced in tabletop gaming, I've recently become engrossed in DnD content on a literary level and have gravitated towards the OSR scene. In comparison to the official DnD and DnD-adjacent material I've exposed myself to, the content that comes from the OSR scene tends to resonate with me on a creative level. Particularly the works by Patrick Stuart (VotE, MoftBM, Deep Carbon Observatory, and the False Machine blog in general), Patrick Wetmore (Anomalous Subsurface Environment), Chris Kutalik (Fever-Dreaming Malinko), Gus L (Dungeon of Signs blog and content) Luka Rejec (UVG, his blog and art in general), Emmy Allen (GoY and the Stygian Library), David McGrogan (Yoon-Suin), and a half a dozen of the more left-field DCC modules. I find these works to be thought-provoking, self-aware, aesthetically coherent, introspective, wildly creative, and in my opinion transcends the idea of genre. With that said, I find OSR's game-theory, adherence to the Dying Earth genre, and the punk-Lovecraftian try-hard ""edginess"" of brands like LotFP to be some of the least interesting aspects of the scene.

&#x200B;

While absolutely thrilled to have been moored in the OSR asylum with the rest of you, I am looking for an escape to do a little tourism within other tabletop scenes of a similar caliber in terms of creativity. Any suggestions?

&#x200B;

Perhaps I should mention some dead-ends and disappointments - nearly all official + popular 3rd party content for 5e has let me down. Anything that approaches Tolkien/George R.R. Martin pastiche or fanship pandering really grates me. Most of the great works I've encountered outside the OSR scene tend to be in the realm of science fiction (Gamma World content, Paranoia, GURPS stuff), but I am hoping there are some vibrant/alternative fantasy scenes out there as well.",osr,1551205758.0,1,1840,293

1057,225,14ngia7,"Review of the Old Dragon 2, the second edition of the first and greatest osr brazilian rpg."," 

Hail guys. Old Dragon, the biggest OSR RPG in Brazil., funded last year in 48 minutes, and having achieved several goals. 

It was released in its first edition as an attempt by the creators to have the same experience they had before the bunch of combos brought by 3a. Inspired by the Basic Fantasy experience, the authors independently edited and published a book of 150 pages, with four races, four classes and tools to play up to level 20. It was the first OSR RPG in Brazil and had as its main characteristics: unified save roll, separate races and classes, and specializations (explained later) plus 3rd edition number parameters like stat modifiers 17, +4, and ascending armor classes above 30 for the most epic enemies. 

After 10 or 12 years, changing the way RPGs are written and detecting certain things that could be improved over time, the second edition of this beloved RPG from Brazil was announced, with a unique community in the amount of content produced and collaboration between its members. The new edition was successfully funded in less than an hour (48 minutes) in a crowdfunding format, gaining support from 1322 people, in various digital and physical formats, on FC and Late Pledge. 

The Basic Book is provided free of charge in pdf format, in addition to the SRD being free and easy to consult (<https://olddragon.com.br/livros/srd/>), and the physical hardcover book has an affordable price, much more accessible than the original RPG corebooks in the current edition. 

This analysis aims to analyze the characteristics of the basic book (lLB1), free in pdf, and the expanded rules book (LB2). 

The core book (LB1) has rules up to level 10 Corebook 2, Expanded Rules has rules from level 11 to 15, in addition to dominance rules and mass battles.

OLD DRAGON A RETROGOLEM

Old Dragon is not intended to be a retroclone, but an amalgamation of the best options already presented by several editions of the original Rpg up to advanced 2 in search of the best that one has of this experience in a game. So the core of the system follows this d&d like pattern, and that's why I'm going to talk about what it's different from. Starting with its unique and exclusive concept: Specializations.

SPECIALIZATIONS

Specializations are archetypes that represent different hero concepts than the basic four: fighter, rogue, mage, and cleric, but that fit them. Barbarians are fighters, illusionists are wizards, and assassins are thieves. A specialization streamlines the game and makes its application easier. They share with the base class: hit dice, number of spells per day, number of protection rolls, and have a different XP table, presented in the base class table. So you gain time and agility, in addition to having support from the base class for the creation of any specialization. In the core book we have the barbarians and paladins, as specializations of warriors. Scholar and Druid as cleric specializations; illusionist and necromancer as wizard specs and bards and rangers as thief specs. Specializations can be chosen during character creation and while the character is still at first level.

SEPARATE RACE AND CLASS, BUT WITH THAT STRESS FOR THE RACE AS A CLASS

In addition to all these options, specializations give you enough structure and freedom to create your own, and the ones that caught the most attention in this second edition are the specializations that honor races as a class in the BX and Cyclopedia editions. We have the dwarf adventurer, a warrior specialization exclusive to dwarves, halfling adventurer, thief specialization exclusive to halflings, and elf adventurer, wizard specialization exclusive to elves. Each of these specializations represent, in their honor, the most typical and outstanding examples of their class, with powers and abilities that reflect a classic icon of that class. Want race as a class? Use them. And best of all, they do not exclude the use of other specializations. A group can have an elf adventurer, mixed fighter and mage, and an elf warrior, each with their own focus. There are many, good and meaningful character options.

WARRIORS

Warriors have dv d10, with a +1 attack bonus at each level, to a maximum of +15 at level 15, the game's maximum level. In addition, he has the attractive parry abilities, where he is able to sacrifice a shield or weapon to nullify all damage from a successful attack before the damage is rolled. A true hitting machine, but still deadly, like any old school character.

CLERGY

Clerics have seen a huge improvement in how their skills work. Possessor of divine spells, it can replace any previously memorized spell with Cure Wounds, and besides, here's the best version of warding off undead you'll ever see: When performing the turn undead maneuver, the cleric forces the undead to make a morale check. The morale check, like the classic one, is made in 2d6. If the undead fails andthe results fall in equal numbers (1 and 1, 3 and 3, and etc) the undead turns to dust. Goodbye tables. According to one of the creators, this, in addition to speeding up the game, has probabilities strangely coincident with the classic table, being only necessary to adapt the moral value of the living dead, which was done in the bestiary, the third basic book. DV d8.

WIZARDS

Mage is the most misunderstood class in OSR games. A glass cannon that after firing its shot becomes a 1d4 life fret. To remedy this, mages have more starting spells, plus the ability to Read and Detect Spells, making them more useful overall. DV d4.

THIEF ABILITIES

Following the premise of improving what can be improved, and listening to the community, thieves skills have had their tests changed to d6, in addition to the evolution progression of these skills being customizable. The thief takes 2 to each of his abilities, +2 points, and + his Dexterity modifier as starting points. At levels 3, 6 and 10 he gains 2 more points. The maximum level of a thieves skill is 5, and to succeed on a check requires less than or equal. Ranger and bard have different abilities, but with the same mechanical functioning as the thief since they are archetypes that fit under the umbrella of the thief. The DV of thieves and their specializations is d6.

SAVING THROWS

The saving throws have been merged into 3, and a number related to level and class follows. To this base number we add the Wisdom or Dexterity or Constitution modifiers and we have the three saving throws of their respective attributes. To unify roll under tests, saving throws follow this model, and therefore this value increases across levels. All classes start with the base number 5, and a successful check is achieved by rolling a die and getting a value less than or equal to it.

ARMOR CLASS

Armor class is ascendant, and instead of tables and thaco we have the beautiful BA. Unlike some, to succeed in an attack you must have a result greater than your AC. The draw is on the defense.

RACES

The races have a template similar to the advanced second edition, by more classic standards. They all have some benefit on one of the saving throws, in addition to other classic benefits, such as dwarves hitting ogres and the like easier, elves doing more damage with a bow, and halflings with thrown weapons. As humans are the class that have the fewest benefits, they gain an additional 10% of all XP. 

APPEARANCE, FEATURE AND HISTORY

The core book has solid content, not just the basics of character creation, race, class, equipment, combat, and magic. There is a chapter devoted to providing tables to enrich any character, GM and player alike. These options are further enriched with core book 2, which features more customization options, a more detailed background, and an excellent flashback history option, where we discover the character's background during the game, while also filling out some of the character's skills. character.

FUNCTIONAL LOADING SYSTEM

The load system is intended to maintain the need to manage resources, characteristic of the old school, while making it desirable and as simple as possible. The load system assigns a load value to each object that represents its weight and the difficulty of carrying it. Weapons and armor, take up 1, 2 or 3 charge depending on weight/size. Other equipment takes 1 charge per kilo. Coins occupy every 100 pieces, 1 charge. A character who has a backpack adds +5 to his maximum load. A character's maximum encumbrance rating is the greater of Strength and Constitution. Simple and functional, they did it.

INITIATIVE

Test of wisdom or dexterity. Who passed acts before the enemies. Those who did not pass, act later. Ready. =\]

MOVEMENT IN HEXES

The system features a simple version instead of hex distance calculations. Each character has a movement value, usually 9. This value can decrease due to overload. When the system deals with hex movement scale, it considers that a 6km hex costs x movement points. Each character has their movements in points to travel per day. More difficult terrain costs a greater amount of movement points. So, forget about counting distances. You have 9 movement points to spend, and on this table are the movement costs. What do you do?

TEST ADJUSTMENTS

Tired of consulting what the test modifier is, whether +1, +3, +2 depending on each situation? Your problems are over. All tests have unified settings. The adjustments are: easy +2 on rolls, very easy +5, hard -2, very hard -5. An advantage cancels out a disadvantage. This applies to combat, ability checks, and saving throws. Simple guidelines for arbitrating the argument mentation and narrative development of a task that has significant consequences for the game.

MASTER'S SECTION

This section has extensive solid material for GMs to run their games, especially useful for beginners, and excellent content for reviewing their games based on common sense and fun. Here is the clear adage of ""change the rules if it makes your game more fun"". A generator of dungeons and adventures that make you play easily even without preparation.

MAGIC ITEMS

Not just the classic old school items, but also guidelines and tables for generating new and unique items to surprise those players who have already read everything. 

MONSTERS

The core book features the most iconic classic monsters, plus an exclusive and traditional system: the pygmy fungus and its hair, valuable tobacco herb.

DESIGN NOTES

Throughout the book there are explanatory notes on why the rules are the way they are, how to use or change them to achieve another result, or to tailor the game to your group.

APPENDIX

Here's another shining moment from the book. This index, organized alphabetically, references the rules in both books, the core book and the expanded rule book. So you can pick up any of the books for reference and you'll know where to find what you need, even if it's not in that book.

COMPATIBILITY

Old dragon is directly compatible with everything published up to the second advanced edition of the original roleplaying game. Parameters can be converted but the amounts of power are basically the same. Attribute adjustments have a maximum of +3, the attack bonus has a maximum, for players, of +15, if you are a warrior. The armor class of the strongest creatures goes up to 21. You'll need to convert the club or AC by subtracting 20, and warriors here are real warriors, closer to the advanced version of the original rpg game. With that in mind, it's much easier to convert and take that classic adventure to the table with this system. 

CONCLUSION

For some time Old Dragon had ended their releases. A lot was launched and the public clamored for the compendium, a legendary book never released that would give extra rules, the demand for this book lasted for years and years, it was even written and came out as a B-side document to be downloaded around. However, this additional rule took so long that perhaps it lost its importance, since the game already gave you rules to play up to level 20. In the meantime, everyone had already made do with their house rules The decision to remake the system and rewrite everything based on feedback from players updated the way the system was written. We see that it is the same system, but updated and improved, and with the advantage that the advanced rules have already been released together with the basic book, not missing from the consumer at any time. I plan to touch points in these advanced rules in the future. The main virtues of the system are: solidity and accessibility. The old dragon pdf was always free, if you wanted you could buy the physical book. This one, by the way, always very accessible, showing the publisher's commitment to popularize the hobby. The physical quality of this new edition is impeccable: color illustrations for the most important parts, such as the cover, chapter openings, references to races and classes. It is worth noting that the printing house where it was printed is known for the quality of its products, being the only one in Brazil authorized to print the original rpg books in their fifth edition. Old dragon proposes to provide you with an rpg experience already consolidated by decades of playtest, experience that was lost from the 3rd edition and was never recovered. It does this successfully, however, without being a copy and paste of old systems, but rather, the use and affirmation of those things that have worked for so long, but excluding what never worked (robbery in % for example). The best things from that old gaming experience have been preserved. The worst, removed. And everything in the game is modular, you can change the charge, magic, initiative rule without breaking. Its core has been playtested for over ten years, and changes from the latest version have been through 2 years of playtesting with the community. The system has improved, maintained its virtues: solidity and accessibility, and successfully manages to give you the old-school experience, without philosophizing about the natural nature of the dialectical agency of the emergent narrative of the OSR rpg and giving you, instead, fun, exactly as it used to be.

I’ve been contemplating the idea of fleshing out the project into a full module and setting book for an OSR-rules game, as I’ve been playtesting my project document with friends and having a ball, and thought it would be fun to get some feedback from the OSR community.

Are any of you interested in the idea of an OSR game based in third millennium Ancient Mesopotamia?

As a player, what would you want to see in a campaign like this? Is there anything you know about the setting—or want to learn more about—that you think you’d enjoy seeing in a campaign?

What sort of information would you want as a GM to bring Ancient Mesopotamia to life?

—

My own research focus is on deities and mythology so those feature prominently in the campaign. Yesterday I ran an adventure loosely based on Gilgameš’s encounter with the legendary forest guardian Humbaba, and the players ended up spending six hours exploring Humbaba’s curse-protected forest and collecting items to help them with their final confrontation with him.

I’m also a really big fan of linguistics and can’t help myself but to include a lot of Sumerian in my project. One feature my friends/players seemed to really enjoy is the ability to construct their own ancient Sumerian names - most of these names are theophoric (e.g., people are named after a deity, usually in a short sentence like “Enki provides”) so I was able to give players a list of name formulas with translations to plug a god’s name into and make a wholly unique name for their character. Outside of naming schemes, it’s actually kind of neat from an academic perspective how fast they picked up Sumerian words and phrases! I think the language additions add a lot of flavor to the campaign. 😊

As a DM and as a player, I really love the OSR philosophy of encouraging lateral thinking and rewarding creative problem-solving. Historical settings are fun to explore with that mindset, as many mythological beings can be quite dangerous but don’t necessarily have malevolent intentions. OSR in general feels like the perfect rules system to explore a setting like this. ",osr,1732815923.0,1,2288,392

1069,5,1gy0xj3,Does the OSR community have a Nazi problem?,"I joined a local 0D&D group in my area and then left when I found out everyone at my table was a Neo-Nazi.

This was my first experience joining an OSR table so I figured I’d ask if this is common or not. Especially since there was a recent controversy with Questing Beast accepting a sponsorship from an alt-right publisher, I wonder how pervasive of an issue this is.

Edit: To clarify, they self identified as such. They weren’t just to the right of me. They didn’t just hold some racial prejudices and biases, they didn’t just support candidates I didn’t support. They actively like Hitler.",osr,1732372430.0,1,594,106
1070,7,1jezkmd,My players won't stop collecting teeth,"In our Mausritter campaign, I'd created a wizard's tower inhabited by a necromancer obsessed with teeth. He went by The Dentomancer. The Dentomancer made an offhand comment about bring willing to buy teeth off of them, and wasn't really interested in anything besides teeth. It was a hook for a sidequest, nothing more really. 

** I was a fool. **

What I thought was just a fun detail became a goal for one of my players. In his mind, teeth = gold = xp. Teeth have become a complex mechanic with numerous details and caveats. Each time he kills a creature he wants to know the monetary value of their teeth, spends time taking the teeth out of corpses, and asking if any creatures have unique teeth. 

This idea had spread to the rest of my players. They will often choose to engage in combat based solely off of tooth quantity and quality. I've had to Google the number of teeth for real life creatures pretty consistently, and there are now special teeth encumbrance rules. Each new type of tooth results in a new ruling. I'm a big believer in ""rulings not rules"" but they are pushing that philosophy to its limit. It has been six months of consistently tooth-based gameplay. 

The thing is the players have yet to return to the Dentomancer to cash in their teeth. I don't know what will happen when they do. It's not really that big a deal but I wish I had a real solution for this. What should I do?



TL;DR: My Mausritter players have become obsessed with collecting teeth for money, to the point it has become a significant mechanic. ",osr,1742397906.0,1,1543,279

Like, where was this game when I was flipping through spell lists and juggling ability modifiers? It’s just so clean—no fuss, no bloat, just straight to the good stuff.

The way it handles characters, exploration, and danger is exactly what I didn’t know I was looking for back then. No rigid classes, just who you are and what you carry. And the game actually trusts you to be creative instead of boxing you into a list of pre-approved actions. It’s wild how much freedom it gives without ever feeling loose or undefined.

If I had known about Cairn back then, I probably would’ve spent way less time stressing over mechanics and way more time actually playing.",osr,1741654480.0,1,758,135
1074,14,1i4wq5y,Running 5e showed me how much I love OSR principles,"I ran D&D5e for the first time in about 4 years last night, at a one-shot event for strangers hosted at a local cafe, and it was the most unwieldy, inelegant and unsatisfying GMing experience I’ve had in years.

I put a party of 4 Level 1 PCs through ‘Barrow of the Bone Blaggards’ by Necrotic Gnome because I know it pretty much off by heart. 5e’s lack of exploration procedures and dungeon turns, as well as how distinctly special and overpowered even a Level 1 party is, was infuriating. Darkvision, cantrips, and many class features just make it a complicated and poor situation.

However, by far the worst offender was the Skill system. I had to shut down players calling for their own skill checks: “You step carefully into the murky chamber-“ “Perception - 11, damn!” “Please, just let me finish and roll when I ask you to.” The players constantly insisted on contextualising everything from the myriad numbers on their sheets as opposed to making in-universe decisions.

The players had a good time, and I didn’t show my frustrations, but it was so disappointing that they couldn’t get the full experience due to the leeway given by a bloated and weak system.

I’ve never felt more vindicated that the OSR/NSR/rules-light space is the place for me. I’ll be sticking with my staples of Cairn, OSE, Vaults of Vaarn, X-Borgs, Into the Odd, and Mothership from now on!",osr,1737287114.0,1,1372,239

1077,17,1h925nb,A 'What' Fiend?,"Laying in bed, bored with bronchitis today, when a post on here gave me a flashback to an old gaming memory. It hearkens back to when 'meta-gaming' was something a lot of people still took seriously. This might get long, but I'm not going anywhere for a while, so let's get started.  

Back in the mid-90s, I was talking with my original DM, the guy who got me into the game and passed away from alcoholism this February at the age of 46. We always took turns DMing, but we never got to play together because no one else in our groups liked DMing. He said we should go see if there were any postings at the local hobby store (local being 45 miles away). So, we did, and the owner of the establishment told us about this group of older guys who were looking for two new members, gave us their number, and sent us on our way.  

We called the number and talked for a while and they agreed to bring us in for a game and see if we were a good fit. We were like 17 and 18 at the time and these guys were all in their forties and had been playing since before we were born. Also, they were all bounty hunters, police officers, and such, so we were very intimidated. Nice guys, though!  

We chatted for a while before the game, asking each other about our experiences with the game, cool gaming memories, and so on. Turns out this group of three players and the DM had been playing since 1977, with the same guy DMing every session. They started a new campaign when 2nd Edition came out in '89, and this game we were taking part in was that campaign, like eight years into it! And they were all only around 10th level. Made us feel like munchkiny power gamers!  

So, during the session, I'm doodling on a piece of paper. I was drawing a pit fiend, and one of the guys said, ""Whoa, what is that you're drawing?"" I said, ""It's a pit fiend...?"" thinking everyone knows what that is, right? But they all got up and bent down to look at it and were just oohing and ahing. One of them asked, ""You've fought one of these before? Did you live?"" And it struck me just how dedicated and hardcore these guys were about D&D.  

Not just the giant hand drawn, framed world map hanging behind the DM's chair, or the fifty page campaign bibles they printed out for us detailing their eight year long adventure, or the expertly painted minis and custom battle mats, but these mother fuckers had been playing D&D for twenty years, and since they had never fought a pit fiend, they didn't even know what it was!  

We explained that we were both DMs too, and we were looking for the game because we never got to play together, and they understood. But one of them said, ""Ah, that must take a lot of the magic and mystery out of the game when you're a player."" And that's when I told him, ""Dude, we've been playing for like six hours now and I've never encountered a single thing I've seen here tonight before. All of your magic items, the monsters we've fought, all of this is new to me, and I've read pretty much every DM's book printed."" They all looked at their DM who was grinning from ear to ear.  

No one said anything else about it after that, we just went back to playing. But I think those guys got a much greater understanding of what an incredible DM they had, and my friend and I got a look at what great players could be. Anyway, I'm gonna go hit the cough medicine and pass out, just felt like sharing a memory!",osr,1733605276.0,1,3403,649
1078,18,1i9wjwb,My moment of validation as an old-school GM,"I've been playing TTRPGs for \~32 years (most of that as a GM).

I just couldn't get comfortable with the game, so I suggested an old-school game. I ran a series of unconnected modules for about a year. For the past 8 months, I've been running a popular megadungeon. Last night, this occurred:

>Player 1: ""I gotta tell you, I haven't felt this way about roleplaying since I was a kid.""

>Just then, Player 2 found a strange pebble on the body he was looting. Jokingly, he tried to activate it as if it were an Ioun stone. I told him that it began circling his head.

>Player 1: ""What!? What is that?""

>Player 2: ""I think we just found an Ioun stone."" (they did)

>Player 1: ""Holy shit! This really is JUST like the games back in the day. That's awesome!""

1082,22,1bkr7y5,Day one of Gary Con XVI is on the books and...wow.,"This is my first year after putting it off and making excuses all that time. The loss of Jennell Jaquays and the 50th anniversary are what finally broke this camel's back.

So far, I'm in awe. Back in my hotel room now, and my head is still buzzing.

I met and conversed with the likes of Ed Greenwood, Erol Otus, Larry Elmore, Jeff Easley, Tim Kask, Darlene, Diesel LaForce, and Mike Pondsmith. I almost got my cleric's dumb ass melted by acid in a delightful B/X dungeon crawl run by Douglas Niles. I bought way too many books from grodog at the Black Blade booth.

Last, and perhaps most importantly, I got to experience the original Braunstein scenario with Dave Wesely. A staggering nineteen other players (including Ben Milton of the Questing Beast YouTube show) were utterly consumed by the amazing historical fantasy.

For those who don't know, Braunstein I is a freeform RPG pre-dating D&D that's set in a fictional Prussian city of the same name circa 1790. Every player is given a character with unique goals and victory conditions. These include university students, local nobility and merchants, traveling entertainers, French spies, and more. The roleplay element is almost 100% at the forefront, with dice being rolled only once during this evening's session to resolve a duel (that my character lost). I played the leader of the democratic student revolutionaries who also happened to be the Baron's spoiled son. I went to jail, got part of my ear chopped off, and ended up marrying a prominent banker's beautiful daughter (played by a very nice bald fellow). A thoroughly engrossing and educational ride.

To call Dave a master GM would be a colossal understatement. Never in my 3.5 or so decades of play have I beheld another on his level. Just a natural born storyteller who brought the time period to life and enabled us all to produce this crazy improvised soap opera with these complex relationship webs and dark secrets and such. The sheer craft and insight, the way every simple answer to a question led into a sly suggestion.The man's a wonder. It's humbling, really.

In fact, I think the reason I'm still giddy because I feel like I learned so much from him in so short a time that my brain has only started unpacking and processing it all. It would be like an amateur painter today getting to take a lesson with a Rembrandt or Picasso or something.

Bless Dave for still coming out at nearly 80 years of age and showing people like me firsthand how roleplaying began, years before any sort of proper roleplaying game as we would recognize it now was even on the market.

1083,23,1gka7c6,Cairn 2e thoughts,"Holy shit, I just read through Cairn 2e, and I’m seriously impressed. It’s got two books—the Player’s Guide and the Warden’s Guide—and together they offer everything you could ask for and pull you in to a really interesting and unique new setting. The new classes in the Player’s Guide are exactly the kind of thing that makes you want to start rolling up a character on the spot. The names are a little funky (""Jongluer"" instead of ""Bard,"" for example), but it’s all part of the vibe and work when taken all together.

The art nails it, too—simple and not distracting mostly, but fun where it matters in the class descriptions with unique things like robot arms and fungal mutations to support the quirky setting. The rules stay super-lite but with enough added structure to really support a long-term game for just about anyone. I love rules-lite games and this really hits a sweet spot for simple rules with just enough support. Plus, both books are super readable, with clean layouts and artwork that’s atmospheric without trying too hard.

The second book, the Warden’s Guide, completely nails it on the world-building side. The d20 tables absolutely rock. Every entry flows, no awkward combos, and the map creation tools and dungeon building systems are set up to balance detail without bogging you down. Everything item on every list has clearly been carefully curated and considered before being included. The hex crawl rules are right on target for me, too. Everything fits together smooth as hell. I haven't been this excited to bust out the paper and pencils and build something from scratch in a long time! Super cool!

Character advancement’s always been a bit of a question mark for me with Cairn, but the examples here make it a lot easier to grasp. I’m not totally sold yet, but I’m much more open to trying it out with these examples for support.

**And the best part: Yochai Gal released both books for free! Nearly 300 pages of pro-quality content, and he didn’t charge a single dime.** In the OSR scene these days, it’s rare to see something of this caliber free of charge, and it’s a super classy move, right up there with Chris Gonnerman's BFRPG, Charlie Mason's White Box, and other classic pillars of the community. Cairn’s had a huge fanbase for a while, but with the extra content in Cairn 2e it really feels like a new classic to me now. 

Reading these books totally made my day. I can't wait to roll up some guys and send them on a quest! 

Epic props and gratitude to Yochai Gal—masterful work. ",osr,1730822858.0,1,2525,441
1084,24,1csuiwm,OSRIC 3.0 Mission Statement,"Matt Finch of Mythmere Games just published OSRIC mission statement at the [Knights & Knaves Alehouse](https://knights-n-knaves.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?p=310619&sid=bc9df66ac8e684285312387ec9ff9e5d#p310619):

*Since the “OSRIC's Path Forward” thread, there has been more discussion about OSRIC, licensing, and so forth.*

*Stuart and I are working on an OSRIC 3.0, but it will be under the AELF License (a Mythmere Games license that's similar to the OGL). OSRIC 3.0 will be produced by Mythmere Games, and we are planning (tentatively) for a Kickstarter in September or October of this year.*

*A few points:*

*1) Simply maintaining OSRIC under the OGL is possible at this time, but in the long run I think it's a bit of a risk. WotC can probably cut off access to new users of the OGL at any time by “withdrawing the open offer”. I don't think I'm giving WotC a roadmap here; they almost certainly are aware of this approach to the license. They wanted to do more than that to kill it quickly, but there's a much more reliable way to poison it over time, which is simply to withdraw the offer to “sign on” to the OGL. But after the massive backlash to their attempt to kill the license at one blow, they will have to wait a while before mentioning the OGL again. This potential future withdrawal of the offer would create a problem for anyone new who wanted to publish something for OSRIC, so it behooves us to move to a different license now, before the axe eventually comes down.*

*2) The ORC license has some problems with easy usability. I won't go into those because it's complicated and also because there's discussion about it in lots of other places. The AELF License, since it works in the same way as the OGL, is familiar enough that it can be adopted relatively easily by anyone familiar with the OGL.*

*3) OSRIC 3.0 is intended to be completely backward-compatible with OSRIC 2.0, and it shouldn't require any “new versions” of adventures that have been published in the past. There might turn out to be minor glitches in terms of backward compatibility, but those will be the exception.*

*4) The reasons for coming out with a new version:*

*a) First, the license, as mentioned above.*

*b) Secondly, it's to meet the needs of a younger batch of gamers in a context where the PDFs of the original books are available from WotC (which wasn't the case when we originally published OSRIC 2.0). This means several different avenues of approach.*

*—– The writing style will use bullet points and other visual call-outs to avoid the “wall of text” effect. Even those of us raised in pre-internet days are starting to find the bullet-point arrangement preferable to a long block that doesn't visually separate and organize the more important elements of the text.*

*— We're going to include a VTT-friendly method of scale since so many people now game online.*

*— We're going to try to make this version what EOTB calls a “teaching edition,” meaning lots of guidance for playing the game. The “how to play” information is in the original books to a degree, but it can be presented at the forefront and that's what anyone new to the whole OSR needs. Also, AD&D is simply more complex than other OSR games like B/X, so it needs to be presented in a step-by-step format that draws the learner into the process.*

*More information to come later.*

Great move to focus on teaching and accessibility!

First edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons is packed to the brim with stuff that stood the test of time, but its presentation and density sometimes scares people away.

1087,27,1bo5yxe,Filtering out AI content on Drivethrurpg,"This came up in my most recent News Roundup, and I realized that I hadn't checked out Drivethru's filtering system recently. Last year, prior to the upgrade of the new website, when one set up a new title you were asked to check a box if any AI assets were used in the creation of the title, and, if they were, this fact was displayed fairly prominently on the title listing.

Now, they've moved that to the filters listing, a longish table that has a bunch of different filters, and AI/handmade is an option way at the bottom, under ""Creation Method"". I've uploaded a few titles since the change, and I didn't even notice the filter. What is more frustrating is that titles are not explicitly called out as having AI assets. In order to sift through them, you have to actively filter for them (Format --> Creation Method --> AI or Handmade). I'm also not sure how accurate the filtering is, as it includes Sine Nomine's Cities Without Number as having AI assets, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't.

I've reached out to Drivethru via and Publisher's Discord and asked if they can restore the previous visible tag to each title listing so that it is much easier to tell if a product contains AI assets or not. I know this is a hot topic amongst gamers, and some folks might be dismissive of the concerns of myself and others, but I wanted to post this in case folks don't know how to filter out the AI content, or, if you feel strongly about it, might want to contact Drivethru and ask them to restore the previous tags.",osr,1711453913.0,1,1516,279

1089,30,1csar1u,I've been running open tables at local game stores for the past 11 years. Here is how I made it happen.,"I mentioned in a thread here in /r/osr that I have been running open table games since 2013. /u/Radiant_Situation_32 asked for a post about how I was successful doing it. I'll try to keep this as brief as possible and then answer questions in the comments if anyone has any. (If anyone is even interested.) The biggest factors in my success are the last 3 bullets. AMA I guess?

* I started with Pathfinder Society in 2013. The first time I ever played a game it was an open, public table. 

* The first time I ever ran a game was a Pathfinder Society table. I only ran the game because the GM ghosted the 6 players that showed up to play. I went into it completely unprepared having never seen the module until I picked it up to start running it. The players helped and were very understanding. 

* After spending some time with Pathfinder Society I decided that the rules in Pathfinder were too restrictive. I got into an argument with the Venture Captain for the area about how many people I was allowed to have at the table and never ran PFS again.

* I missed that open table feel so I went looking for something else. I came across Dungeon Crawl Classics. I got a free copy of the full rulebook on Free RPG Day. I read it and LOVED it, but no one in my area was playing it. 

* I decided to steal Pathfinder Society's model and start running local open tables for DCC. (Unaware at the time that Goodman Games has an organized play program called Road Crew). 

* I partnered with a local game store and got permission to run my game. I advertised here on Reddit in my city's local sub, I advertised in a meetup for local gamers, and I posted on Facebook in a local geeks community group. That first game 3 people showed up. 2 of them were there because they are good friends and didn't want to see me fail at this new idea. The other guy saw the ad in the geek group and decided to come out. (I haven't seen him at a game since). So my first DCC game was 3 people. SUCCESS! 

* I enjoyed it so much I did it again a month later. That time I advertised in all the same places and had close to 25 people show up. I guess showing it was on a regular schedule made people believe in it more. I found 2 other players willing to run games and we split the tables up as best we could. 

* DCC was so popular I expanded to doing it twice a month. Then eventually ever Saturday. The other players were not willing to run games other than occasionally, so I dealt with it. Sometimes dealing with it meant running for 14 players at the same time. It sucked. It was awful, but **not a single player got turned away**. (Which was with my argument with the head of Pathfinder Society was about. I wanted too many players at my table according to PFS rules.)

* I expanded to running twice a week at the local game store. One weekend day, one week day. 

* Shortly after my switch to twice a month I started a local Facebook group called Reno Dungeon Crawlers. I used that to advertise and find people to play in my games. (The group currently sits at 1200 members.) 

* I allowed other people to find players and referees in the group. This helped expand my reach. My group is by far the most popular locally in terms of finding an RPG game. We have groups running games almost every day of the week who find players in that group. 

* Since starting the group and running games on a regular basis I've run a number of different games. Metamorphosis Alpha, Original D&D, Swords & Wizardry (several different variations), Paranoia, Mork Borg, Old-School Essentials, OSRIC, and a bunch more I'm probably forgetting. 

* My last completed campaign was a 2.5 year OSE campaign. I had a home brew world and used the hex map from the Isle of Dread to let the players hex crawl. When we finished that campaign they had established their own stronghold.

* Unless I was deathly ill, or the roads were no good (we get a lot of snow here) **I never cancelled a game.** I firmly believe this is a huge part of my success. 

* **I never turn away a player who wants to play.** Even if I have too many players I ask them to bear with me and help me make it work. People are generally accommodating. 

* On the converse side **I never don't run the game.** If a game is scheduled I run it, even if only 2 people show up, I run it. We make it work. 

The bottom line is if you want it to be successful, you have to be dedicated to it and put in the work. The only time I haven't had active, public, open play tables is during covid when the store was shut down to gatherings. The weekend it opened back up I was masked up with my players back in the store.",osr,1715741900.0,1,4632,888

1091,32,1eqjtny,"His Majesty the Worm: tarot-driven, slice-of-life megadungeon exploration","Hello!

For the past 8 years, I've been working on a game called **_His Majesty the Worm_**.

# What is His Majesty the Worm?

*His Majesty the Worm* is a new-school game with old-school sensibilities: the classic megadungeon experience given fresh life through a focus on the mundanities and small moments of daily life inside the dungeon.

* **Food, hunger, light,** and **inventory management** are central to play and actually fun.

* **Tarot cards** are used to create an action-packed combat system that ensures that all players have interesting choices every minute of combat: no downtime!

* The game has **robust procedures.** Adventure in the Underworld, rest in roleplaying-driven camping scenes, and plot long-term schemes in the City at the center of the Wide World.

* The relationships between companions, called **Bonds,** powers the rest and recovery mechanic of the game. The game centers the human element. 

The game is intended for a traditional setup between a single GM and 3-6 players. It emphasizes long-term, Metroidvania-like play. Tarot cards are used as a randomizing element. If you like things like _Dungeon Meshi_ or _Rat Queens_, you might find something fun in this game.

**You can learn more about the game, and find links to buy either the physical or digital editions, [on our website](https://www.hismajestytheworm.games/)!**

(When it launched, the physical edition sold out within 3 hours. The books are now restocked at Exalted Funeral!)

1092,33,1j7t0zp,Was 5e originally considered a triumph for the old school?,"I was watching the interview between Ben Milton and Mike Mearls, and at one point, Ben mentioned that when 5e first launched, the OSR community initially saw it as a victory for their style of play—but over time, that perception soured.  

I wasn’t around the OSR at the time—I only discovered it after 2020—but that idea resonates with me. Even before I became disillusioned with 5e and moved toward OSR games, I remember 5e in 2014 feeling much closer to the experience I wanted. It wasn’t so much the original system that pushed me away, but how both the system and its community evolved over time. A Knight at the Opera [wrote a post that](https://knightattheopera.blogspot.com/2024/10/in-mouth-of-madness.html) really captured my feelings on this shift. Even now, I feel like I'd be happy to run a campaign using *Into the Unknown,* or even 2014 PHB-only with some hacks.  

So, for those who were active in the OSR back in 2014: Does Ben’s description of the community’s reaction sound accurate? If so, did the OSR community ultimately reject 5e because their initial reaction was inaccurate in ways that become more clear over time; or did the game start in a place that mostly aligned with OSR sensibilities before drifting away?

1093,34,1j647sw,Does anyone else feel like the scene is getting stale?,"Not a rant, nor complaining, I’m trying to spark discussion. 

Does anyone else feel like the OSR scene is getting stale? I feel like I see way fewer blog posts nowadays, and that every recent product release is either:

1) A rehash of a game (often OSE or Mork Borg)we already have with a few house rules. 

2) An art piece masquerading as a TTRPG product. Utterly unusable at the table and only hood to look at. 

Maybe I’m just out of the loop but it seems like we’re getting so much less new and creative stuff nowadays. That’s not to say that there’s nothing new and creative (Crowns 2e is cool!), just that the days of endless truly creative stuff is gone. 

Truly, I fear that we have reached the end point of commercialization in our niche hobby. It is easier and more lucrative to appeal to TTRPG book collecters rather than TTRPG player, and thus we see more and more product focused at them. 

Or matbe I’m full of doom and gloom. Perhaps I have rose tinted glasses on for the past. I was not there after all, so perhaps I am mythologizing what came before. 

So like, are things getting more stale? Are they getting less interesting? Or am I just losing it?

1096,37,1d5uzix,Knave 2e disappointment? Other opinions?,"Just got Knave 2e physical book in the mail. The hardcover quality is good and the artwork by Peter Mullen is awesome!

I'm quite disappointed with the rules and content though . . . it seems so, I don't know, half-finished? Not play tested? It's hard to say but it seems like the content was just kind of mashed together without much thought.

A lot of the random tables seem like they were glued in to pad the page count  without any real context or explanation of how/when to use them. I know it's subjective but the entries aren't particularly inspiring to me either. I understand that it's  a matter of taste but it seems like ChatGPT could give me a similar list of 100 different types of fabric, etc . . . nothing is particularly novel or creative.

Some of the rules seem pretty half-baked, too. The number of encounter rolls per day using the hazard dice and the ration depletion seems off. The relic magic was very disappointing: basically just telling me as the GM to make something up by myself.

I loved the first version of Knave: so much value and play was crammed in 7 pages! I played the hell out of it! Just wondering what others' thoughts on Knave 2e are. I wanted to love this game . . . it was going to be my go to system but now I'm regretting the money I spent. Maybe I'm missing something?

Curious what others are thinking of Knave 2e . . .

EDIT:

I want to thank everyone for sharing their opinions! I think I came into the Kickstarter with the wrong expectations. The book and art are beautiful and I'm glad that many folks are having a great time with it at their table. I'll admit to not having played it yet and will give it a test drive in a dungeon. Good gaming all!

  
UPDATE (2 months later):

I took the advice of some of the folks in this thread and gave Knave 2e a solo spin in some dungeons. I used the new OSE Anthologies to play ""The Jeweler's Sanctum"" and ""Curse of the Maggot God"" using the Knave 2e rules. I had an alright time of it. Thanks to those who suggested I get more information and real experience with the rules. 

Knave 2e will not be my 'go to' system but I wanted to share my hopefully more balanced and informed experience below to be fair. Thanks again to all who commented to agree or disagree. 

  
POSITIVES IMO

+ Character creation: 

(a) I found a few tables that helped me create some interesting looking Knaves that were interesting and fun. But I had to go to the NPC section for this . . . 

+ Rules: 

(a) The rules translated well to the OSE dungeons and stats. It was quick and easy to resolve encounters. 

(b) The rules didn't require much in the way of conversion. I just used the AC stats in the module as written. Same as Knave 1e this was good. 

+ Encounters: 

(a) I used the overloaded dice and it was okay in the dungeon crawl. I had to ignore a couple of rolls for consecutive burnt torches. It wasn't that bad. The dungeons had their own 'shift' tables built into the random encounter tables so I used those for dungeon shifts. 

NEGATIVES IMO

- Character creation: 

(a) I didn't really prefer the 'careers' and their items. I traded most out for other stuff and it seemed weird rolling two often very disconnected backgrounds. 

(b) Still really not a fan of Relic magic. I love the idea but I didn't find the tables helpful enough in creating relics and Gods. The results were strange and hard to bind together into something workable and fun.

(c) Traveling to the NPC section for character details was a hassle. But that was my choice to spice up the characters to make cartoon sketches so not Knave 2e's problem.

- Encounters: 

(a) I tried using the random tables for dungeon shifts and they were really weird results that I would have struggled to use in the module as written. Thankfully these particular modules had 'shifts' that were written in so I used those instead.

I tried running a game without the thief because of some post I saw and I must say, I feel the diffrence. The players are more active because anyone can do thief stuff. Not just the thief. Suddenly they try things outside of the ""normal way"" ie, the wizard lockpicks, the fighter scouts and so on. Now the players think more actively while dungeneering. How to open the door, how to deal with traps, how to hide and so on.

I was first made aware of Basic Fantasy shortly into my journey into the OSR, which began in late 2015 after messing around with 5e for a while. The number one thing that blew me away then and continues to do so is the sheer *accessibility* of the entire product line. You can download every single released book and a ton of ""playtest"" content in PDF form on the website absolutely free of charge with no strings attached. (And if you decide to buy the books, they're sold super cheap. Basically at-cost) If that were the only thing it had going for it as compared to other RP systems, that would be good enough, but there's more!  
  
 It's a really elegant B/X clone with some ""quality of life"" changes such as separating race and class, and using ascending AC which may be more familiar to modern players. There are great tools for players and GMs on the website, and a lot of super helpful and friendly people on the boards. There's a reason this game continues to get recommended and stays visible among the seemingly never-ending sea of new releases, despite having been around since 2006. It just does everything right.   
  
The minor gripes some people seem to have, like the layout and art, don't really bother me at all personally. I think it's fine. It's charming. Things are easy enough to find.

(I know that does come to a large degree from DM playstyle, but it is pretty consistently how 5e DMs do it across the board)

It really feels like it limits your creativity. I want to do this cool thing, but my character didn't specialize for it so I guess I'll just only do *my thing*. 

It's harder to enjoy roleplay when much of social interaction gets limited by rolls and mechanics. The other day, a DM told us all to roll Insight or Perception, then outright told us the person we were speaking to was suspicious.

Gee. There was no other way to convey that.

5e combat, too, feels painfully long and drawn out.

In these types of discussion, it is always brought up that Super DM can run it totally different and way better in 5e. Perhaps, but the vast majority of 5e DMs still do these things.

Can anyone else relate? It's harder to enjoy 5e now, but 5e is still the only game people I know play. And I honestly don't feel like playing online with guys in their 50s, sorry.

EDIT: upset a lot of people with my comment about guys in their 50s. I don't have anything against yall; it's just that if I were to join an online group, I'd rather join people who are roughly within my generation. I'm sure you would prefer the same. ",osr,1719479153.0,1,1599,304

1104,46,1ddid38,The woes of overcoming 5e iniritia,"Up at the top, this isn't a rant, it's not even my woes.

So, I have a player who pretty recently discovered there are games other than D&D, and he's been having fun trying out systems and settings. We were talking about how he's found that he likes rules light systems, because he likes playing a character, and doesn't want combat meta to get in the way of that.

I mentioned that he should join my Knave game and see what D&D without the rules is like, so he did. In the first session he killed a jackalope, and at it when they got back to camp. NPCs let him know that this was a bad thing, as killing a jackalope is bad luck, and eating them is worse if there can be a worse. So the player knows he's cursed, and is just waiting for me to tell him to reroll a passed save of some kind. This has turned in to recurring joke at the table. He also failed a navigation roll while in the woods and got the party lost, so it's a recurring joke that his character ofter offers to be at the front of the group, but the group doesn't want him leading.

All this to say, he's bothered to tell me after multiple sessions how much fun he's having. So, he's tried to tell his other groups about it. And they don't get it. All they hear is that he has no cool abilities, the first time he fired off a spell, it failed, he's cursed, he got lost in the forest, and ""how is that fun, it sounds terrible?""

And all I can think is, ""Man, it's too bad they don't get to have this."" I get power fantasy. I've played lots of games. Even as a PC I've played a dragon, a half-zombie-ninja, a time mage. I'm not against gonzo fun. But I get sad that some people think that's the *only* way to have fun.

1105,47,1f06xbr,More than 100 designers joined the game jam around my latest SRD so I decided to make the game it is based on free for everyone ,"Hey everyone,

A couple of months ago, I released a one page OSR-inspired tabletop role-playing game of axes, runes, spirits, and legends, called Songs and Sagas. My twitter post blew up in popularity with like 22K views and 500 likes (even more unreal IMO considering the current state of the platform). Anyway.

I was really proud of the core and exploration mechanics I had designed, so I decided to open-license the game and publish a free creator kit and SRD for everyone to use. I then organized a game jam on Itch, and over 100 designers jumped on board, currently working on their own products to be ""Carried in Songs and Sagas"" (naming monikers is so fun ^^).

Now that we have 100 participants in the jam, I decided to celebrate by making the game free for everyone!

You can download the game on [itch](https://fari-rpgs.itch.io/songs-and-sagas) or go to [songsandsagas.farirpgs.com](https://songsandsagas.farirpgs.com/) for more details around the game, creator kit, and what we plan to do next with the system.

Do keep an eye on the submission page of the jam because there are some pretty amazing designers working on their projects including the folks from A Couple of Drakes (Dead Belt, Court of Blades), Andrew Boyd of Pandion Games (Whispers in the Wall, Substratum Protocol), Matteo Sciutteri (Bloodstone, The Breach) and Alan Bahr of Gallant Knight Games(TinyD6, D6 System: Second Edition, SYMA)

1107,49,1i0b2fd,Experience Report: Converting my 5e group to OSR (Dolmenwood),"I converted a group/campaign from a 5e, homebrew campaign to a Dolmenwood one. We’re super happy and it was extremely fun so far. Both my group and the game itself surprised me in some interesting ways.

All of the players were entirely new to RPGs when we started the 5e campaign half a year ago.

What we did:

They got new character sheets (from DW rules), starting at lvl 2, downleveled from their old ones but we found classes/races that are equivalent for most.

I allowed them to bring some stuff that were a good fit, like the ranger’s (now hunter) animal companion (downscaled to DW stats), a glamerweave cloak, some gold and basic gear etc.

I started with visit to a starting town (prigwort) and a clear hook for the suggested starting adventure in the book.

What I was worried about:

- That they would be annoyed by having less combat power and fewer spells (no cantrips)
- That they wouldn’t dig resource/time management, previously I hand waved encumbrance, and they didn’t have to count rations etc.
- Lethality, they are in love with their characters

What actually happened:

Initially one player (sorceress, now enchantress) complained a bit about having fewer powers. “I can’t do the fire thing now?” Etc. but down the line she was fully engaged and had a ton of fun.

They fully embraced resource management, travel, hexcrawling etc. they seem to love to buy stuff, prepare and gauge travel/search risk. I didn’t have to do any convincing.

They didn’t lose a single hitpoint and were able to defeat, like actually murder, a pretty large group of very dangerous enemies entirely through creative play.

I didn’t expect _that_.

I used the advice from the OSR community and the learnings from watching 3d6 DTL campaign. Telegraph danger, be fair but tough, roll in the open etc.

I expected they would perhaps default to sneaking around, avoid danger and pick their fights. But they completely turned the situation upside down. Used intrigue, clever investigations and made allies etc. their only combat situation was a surprise attack that was over in 1 round.

I’m blessed to have such a cool group. But there’s also another factor: OSR _works_.

The way adventures, situations etc. are written, allows for all of these unexpected solutions. The advice that is given to GMs, helps players to find awesome solutions and embrace the challenges.

Even the stuff that seems “cumbersome” like encumbrance and resources, is actually fun and immersive.

There’s something to be said about limiting character powers, but having rich environments and situations that inspire players to find their own, unique approach.

1109,51,1d83fvc,"On 5e Youtubers, and the OSR Playstyle.","Maybe it's just me, but I've noticed something recently in the content of many popular 5e youtubers, like Ginny Di, Deficient Master, Bob World Builder, and a few others.

The thing is that in their most recent videos where they explain how to write and scructure adventures and run games they seem to take the approaches that we've been doing for a long time: letting the emergent narrative do its thing, and have players solve problems with wits rather than mechanical power.

When 5e was at its most popular, railroads also were. Adventures were linear and structured, and challenges had clear, skill-check-based solutions. Now the trend is in the opposite direction:

* Ginny Di is talking about letting the players set their own goals in-backstory and letting the narrative play out automatically, rather than planning it. By the way she talks about this, it seems like she's unaware (?) that all this is remarkably OSR-adjacent. I'm quite possibly wrong.
* Deficient Master regualrly hints at his OSR inspiration, and often adapts OSR concepts to the mechanics of 5e and the tastes of the 5e audience.
* Bob World Builder is the one of these three that most closely uses the structure of OSR games, and most often engages with OSR products directly. He recommends Cairn as ""the default starter RPG"", and recommends trying Shadowdark before moving to 5e after that. In other circumstances, he states that the best 5e starter set is Icespire Peak, which is the one that most closely, IMO, resembles OSR playstyle.

As I write this in my deranged frenzy, I ask you: is it just me, or is the OSR slowly leaking out into the 5e community? Is this a sign that the OSR is gonna become mainstream in the TTRPG community at large?",osr,1717523542.0,1,1727,298

Greetings from the Dens!

Back in December 1999 me (Stephen Chenault), Mac Golden, and my brother Davis Chenault started [Troll Lord Games](https://trolllord.com/). We released our first products at Gen Con 2000 and a few months after that we jumped into publishing d20 content for Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Ed. In ’01 we picked up [Gary Gygax](https://trolllord.com/worlds-of-gary-gygax/) and became his primary publisher. In, 04 we released the first printing of the [Castles & Crusades](https://trolllord.com/castles-crusades/) Players Handbook, our own RPG with its driving attribute check system, the SIEGE ENGINE. Today we are running a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ckg/castles-and-crusades-reforged?ref=1a2oss) for the 10th printing of that very same book.

Being a gamer all of my life, I love to talk gaming and decided it was time I reached out again to the RPG community here on Reddit and spend the evening answering any questions you wonderful folks on Reddit may have!

**My short bio:** My name is Stephen Chenault, one of the founding members and present CEO of Troll Lord Games. We make table top role playing games! Our flagship product is Castles & Crusades, a fast-paced, easy-to-learn OGL game. We launched in 1999 (though I started gaming back in the woebegone days of the 1970s) with a series of adventures and world settings. Within a few short months, we had signed on Gary Gygax, launched our fantasy game [Castles & Crusades](https://trolllord.com/castles-crusades/), our modern, Multi-Genre RPG, [Amazing Adventures](https://trolllord.com/amazing-adventures/), and a host of other projects and games. We’ve published books for both 3rd edition D&D and 5th edition D&D. We just did a soft announcement of our new rpg that is on the horizon, [BARSOOM: The Roleplaying Game](https://trolllord.com/barsoom/).

**The Job:** My primary job is managing the day-to-day operations of Troll Lord Games, from conception to printing. I do a fair bit of writing for the company for both Castles & Crusades and the [World of Aihrde](https://trolllord.com/world-of-aihrde/), as well as fiction and reference material. I do two weekly Twitch shows, a weekly AMA and Troll Round Up, and I also blog about all sorts of things, from world-building to the alien crash at Roswell! Currently, my focus lies on the release of the Codex of the Planes, The Dungeons of Aufstrag, and fiction material for the world of Aihrde.

**Ask me Anything!** I’ll answer just about anything I can from TLG news and history, to working with Gary Gygax, general RPGs, C&C, projects we’ve released/are releasing/plan to release, industry news, game design, setting design, , or whatever enters your noodle space!

1113,55,1e43utr,OSR formating has ruined my desire to read other edition products (in a good way),"Hi all, 

let me start by saying I am most probably one of the young DMs here. I started playing in 3e, skipped 4e  played a lot of 5e and since then embraced OSR. 

My favorite way of DMing, is having a world, build adventures in it, but most importantly bring bought adventures in it as well. So I often buy products that get good reviews by Bryce and run them as somewhat modified side quests.

I am not an absolutist. I think good adventures can be found in all systems, that's why I also buy 5e stuff from time to time. And that's why I felt writing this post. 

The last one I got my hands on is called The Devil's Bridge. A Slavic adventure. Witcher inspired. I thought cool. It's free. Double cool. I open it, 170 pages. It starts with disclaimers, pronunciation guides, long paragraphs of who knows what information. And it got me thinking. 

Do I like OSR for what it stands for or just because many good adventures strive to present the information to the DM in a way that they can use them on the table? Well, both. But the second is a revelation. 5e adventures may be good, but unusable. This Devil's Bridge could have been 80 pages. Easily. And it's not just this. This is just the latest culprit on my list. 

Have you also felt like that? I think it's a shame, to have potentially good products hidden in between paragraphs of backstory and unusable information. ",osr,1721071988.0,1,1379,255

1115,57,1e23nh3,Cairn spellbooks are actually software.,"Yeah, it sounds weird, but hear me out. For those unfamiliar with Cairn (why, it's just 24 pages and free!), everyone can cast a spell here, but you need to have a spellbook in both hands and read it aloud. But here is the thing — each spellbook can contain only one spell. It's actually a pretty elegant decision from a mechanical point of view, considering how much emphasis Cairn puts on inventory management.

But one day I read that some user criticized this system, because it sounds kinda illogical. Only one spell will occupy an entire book? And at first, I kinda agreed that it's just one thing you have to accept as it is, even if it may look wrong. But after some shower thoughts, I had a realization. We need to see those spellbooks as actual software.

First, you have the frontend part, which is your actual GUI, all those shiny buttons you press. That's the part which the spellcaster needs to read aloud to activate the spell. This part can be pretty short, and that's why casting spells doesn't take that long. But after that, you have the backend part, your actual code, or in this case, your spell. This is a combination of symbols, letters, and all other stuff written in a very specific way to trigger the effects.

And as your GUI may be as simple as two or three buttons, the actual logic for those can have thousands lines of code. And that's exactly why you may have one spell, which will occupy an entire book. At least, that's the explanation I will make canon at my table.

I understand that back in the day, standard fantasy-land was weird. DnD was weird. But at the same time, we do not live in the past and standard fantasy-land is co-opted into pop culture and that brings expectatione. 

I like weird, I prefer it even, but I hate the idea of working on something only for it to be met with the stance of “I want my castles and knights”.

Included are mapping procedures to make your own Seas; each of the seven sands that compose the desert-oceans; dozens of fauna (monsters), flora (plants), and phenomena (weird stuff); some lightweight rules for ships, travel, crews, and trade; and more tables than you can shake a stick at, including 1d100 encounters for each of the seven sands. On itch and DriveThru, you can download the first 87 pages for free, which includes mapping, the seven sands, and all of the rules-y stuff, but none of the field guide or the many appendices.

As a kid, I wanted to love *Ravenloft*. But, Hammer and Universal Horror weren't my horror. I grew up in a small town and, for me, the movies on the shelves at my rental store were, you know, of a different quality. So, twenty-five years later, I decided to make the *Ravenloft* that I wanted as a teen, one that's based on schlock horror, midnight movies, and surreal films.

*Gladestrom* is a 200-page hex crawl of highly interlinked dungeons, encounters, and events where each location is inspired by a pre-2000s movie. Every location is highly interlinked with other locations, which means that quests, missions, and more are all built in. **It aims to be a zero-prep setting.** At present, there are roughly 100 mapped locations, countless NPCs, and enough rumors to push players into dangerous situations.

**It's entirely free.**

If you made it this far, I appreciate your time. And, if you decide to check out – or even play – in the world, I'd love to hear about your experience or any guidance you have on making *Gladestrom* more usable, interesting, or enjoyable.

1119,61,1h4yjuy,How big are megadungeons?,"Instead of chiming in on every thread about megadungeons to point out that Caverns of Thracia isn’t a megadungeon, I’m going to post some data around the most commonly-cited megadungeons to try to ground the discourse in empirical terms.

Adventure / number of rooms

Caverns of Thracia: 116

Castle Xyntillan: 350+

Barrowmaze: 400+

Stonehell: 700+

Gunderholfen: 900+

Rappan Athuk: 1000+

Arden Vul: 2000+

For some non-megadungeon context:

Caves of Chao (KotB): 58

Hole in the Oak: 57

Incandescent Grottoes: 58

HitO and IG combined (a suggestion made by many fans of the dungeons): 115

Megadungeons are often defined as being big enough to support an entire campaign, or being practically un-finishable. Real-world campaign length is typically measured in sessions. At a modest 8 rooms per session, we get roughly:

Hole in the Oak: 7 sessions

Thracia: 15

Xyntillan: 45

Barrowmaze: 50

Stonehell: 90

Gunderholfen: 110

RA: 120

AV: 250

In those terms, I’d characterize HitO and Thracia as big dungeons finishable in several levels of play, Xyntillan as a tentpole that will occupy almost all of a level 1-6 campaign, and Barrowmaze as finishable only by the most dedicated groups playing to level 8+. All the megadungeons beyond that fit the ‘you can’t finish/beat them‘ definition.

The discourse around megadungeons has been going on for around 15 years now. In that period, Thracia has been recognized as a classic. And yet it’s only the last few years that I’ve seen it referred to as a megadungeon. So something has changed in the discourse.

It seems that as the popularity of megadungeons has increased (not least as a marketing term), its meaning on forums has expanded to the point that it’s applied to any dungeon that’s larger than average size, or takes more than a handful of sessions to play.

Another factor might be the focus in today’s OSR on relatively short, low-level campaigns that wrap up by 5th level. In that context, something like Thracia is closer to a whole-campaign dungeon.

So random donator: If you passed on, hope you're rolling with Gygax today. If you're out of the hobby, then good luck on new adventures. Either way, your collection improved several lives around here.

1124,66,1ife00w,Nostalgia is such a trap,"I bought the $5 pdf of the Village of Hommlet. I wish I hadn't, but I wouldn't have known that if I didn't buy it. I'm reading through it - or rather trying - because it's just so dense. It will in all seriousness require more notes than many college papers I've written. And, that isn't what bothers me. Gygax's prose has its charms and in the late seventies and early eighties I had a lot more time (being an adolescent with no responsibilities will do that for you). It's a product of the era after all.

No. What bothers me is that ANY modern adventure writing would follow that or even Keep on the Borderlands as a template. And, I say that with all love for Keep. Keep I've had for years and I have an almost intuitive index of its contents in my head at this point. But, I wanted to supplement that with the (in)famous Hommlet. **So, if anyone has a ""starting location"" sort of option that is written for actual use and play and not for Summer reading lists, or wants to share their own notes on Hommlet, I'm all ears.** I honestly don't know what I was expecting. I own G123 and D123. I know what Gygax's work typically looks and reads like. Nostalgia colored glasses get me again.

I'm reminded of why as a young DM I developed the ability to wing and improv as early as I did. It's because I wanted to run games not do homework. Anyway, end rant.

Edit: I appreciate most of you. I'll revisit it when I'm prepared to read Gygax rather than read a gameable product. It's really a testament to the quality of the phenomenon that was D&D that it survived the writing and edits of the day. Some of you though... have even more rose colored glasses than I have.

EDIT EDIT: Thanks for the support, folks. And the offers of notes, too! I'm going to complete this and I'll share my own notes; could be fun to compare notes and what different DMs took from the village! Hell, the process is part of the fun; it just isn't the fun I was expecting for some reason. I know it sounds like I'm talking smack about Gary, but I'm really not. His love of language was a HUGE influence on me and one of the things that kept me a voracious reader as a teenager. And, it's clear when you read anything he touched. But, we really can acknowledge that AND be critical. It's possible. If I can admit my own nostalgia goggles, so can you.

1126,68,1gngool,Starting to rethink this whole OSR thing...,"Curious if anyone can relate.

So, I started out playing and then DMing 5e, as a lot of people do. I grew dissatisfied with 5e, so I looked around for alternatives. I discovered the OSR and dove into it, reading the blogs, watching the videos, and buying the games. I started up a Keep on the Borderlands Moldvay Basic game, though it's fizzled due to out of game reasons. I'm looking to start something up again, but I'm having second thoughts.

The games I tried to run with 5e are very different from the game I tried to run and the games I've considered running with B/X. I've been in the OSR sphere, so I've definitely absorbed a lot of old school sensibilities, but I'm starting to wonder if the OSR* is specifically right for me and my players. 

My players haven't shown a huge amount of interest in the ""dungeon crawl"" scene; especially since it's not really part of 5e or popular culture in general. I don't think they are into the idea of ""survival horror"" and going through many characters. I also think I might actually want something where characters can have more longevity and be involved in longterm storytelling. I know plenty of people have had incredible long term stories emerge from this style of play, but it seems like the high lethality would make this less common. I don't really think you can do something like Lord of the Rings with something like B/X. It wouldn't be the same if you had four consecutive fellowships, lol.

I'm not criticizing these games or the people who like them. I'm just rethinking whether it's right for me. I got sucked into the 5e scene, and then I got sucked into the OSR scene, so this is probably a me problem. 

I think I might want to features larger worlds than dungeons with more going on, with political machinations, travel, etc. (I'm not saying that cant be done with these games, but B/X and its derivations seem very specifically designed for the dungeon).

I guess I'm wondering what recommendations the community has. Would 2e give the things I originally sought from the OSR (higher danger level, role-playing rather than rollplaying, character discovery rather than character building, etc)? Is there some other OSR game that you'd recommend for the complete D&D experience, both below and aboveground?

I'm also wondering if there are any former 5e-ers that can relate to my experience here, as I'm sure I'm not that unique. 

Heck, I'm even wondering if 5e might be worth revisiting with OSR principles and features. There are a number of OSR things I know would have really improved 5e when I ran it (random encounters, reaction rolls, roleplay resolution instead of rolling, etc). But I'd probably end up stripping so much it wouldn't really be 5e anymore.

But yeah, I appreciate any comments and suggestions. 

EDIT: Maybe I didn't word my thoughts correctly. I don't want no dungeon crawling or lethality, but dungeon crawling plus other elements well-supported. Lethality-wise, I can't firmly say yet.

1127,69,1irszg3,I really don't understand why Glumdark is on top of the Kickstarter charts right now. In defense of system-specific and offense of system-agnostic random tables.,">A massive, fully illustrated, painstakingly constructed resource for Game Masters and players of dark fantasy tabletop roleplaying games. Recommended for the likes of Mörk Borg but totally system agnostic and compatible with Shadowdark, Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, or any other TTRPG.

It claims to be system agnostic, which is theoretically true, however the reason why people play Shadowdark over Mörk Borg or Pathfinder over D&D is because these **systems are tools to tell particular type of fiction.**

For example, D&D 5e is largely a game about heroic roleplay where characters brave social, exploration and combat encounters with their bespoke talents. Therefore DMs will tend to run encounters that engage with the PCs character systems. Therefore to maximize fun in those systems, the GM needs to engage with those rules, or else the players end up with a whole bunch of buttons that do nothing.

And 5e, unbeknownst to most of you, I'm sure, has bespoke random tables!

|1d20|Situation|
|:-|:-|
|1|A dragon wyrmling has gathered a band of kobolds to help it amass a hoard.|
|2|Wererats living in a city's sewers plot to take control of the governing council.|
|3|Bandit activity signals efforts to revive an evil cult long ago driven from the region.|

A small snip of the DMG (please don't Pinkerton me, WotC). As you can see Adventure Starters in 5E do a couple things. They set up a situation where players solve a problem through any combination of social, combat encounters and a place to explore. This isn't random design, the table is written that way because of the way 5e, as a game, works. It also references settings and monsters, because those monsters aren't just statblocks, they mean things. Dragons and Kobolds have very distinct roles in the meta-setting of modern D&D.

The players are playing to achieve and overcome conflict.  
  
Mörk Borg is a rules light game driven largely by its setting, which is interlinked with its mechanics to create tone and atmosphere. Mörk Borg mechanics, despite being relatively rules-light, is inextricably linked with its setting. If you ignore The Calendar of Nechrubel, most of the other game elements fall flat. If the world doesn't end, what's the point of the Basilisks under Galgenbeck? If nobody believes the prophecies, then why is the world such a dark place? If characters aren't meant to be fairly disposable, then why do they die so quickly?

https://preview.redd.it/bgj2mfiyzqje1.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=06d4457949df9733bbf6a68216211a13dda82ef9

As you can see, the contents of the table are definitely not system or setting agnostic and build upon the Mörk Borg setting. They also don't seed for encounters, like most OSR games, it is leaving space for emergent storytelling. The players are playing to find out.

You see, while these tables are random, the content is still bespoke for the game and build upon its mechanics and tone.

But here is a Glumdark Table for Quest Seeds example:

1 You meet a hedge wizard who is the victim of a terrible curse. They want you to do some exploring for them. Head to the Covered Waterfall and see if you can find a rumored cache of goods.  
2 Guard the warden Oto Potocnik on their journey to the Blasted Ocean.  
3 The cleric Teja Pohl needs you to seize the Quill of Rats from the Roost of Contemplation.

1. You meet magical dude with nondescript condition. They want you to go dungeon crawl at nondescript place. The dungeon crawl has nondescript loot maybe.  
2. Escort a dude with interesting yet nondescript job title to evocatively named yet nondescript place.  
3. Dude with interesting job needs you to dungeon crawl to find evocatively named thing.

Like I am not crazy right, but running these in either 5E or MB seems very attractive. Evocatively named things have to be made up retroactively to fit the setting or content has to be added through GM fiat.

What difference does it make if I go to the Blasted Ocean over the Covered Waterfall? Neither these places are real or even loosely defined. There is no restriction, which could breed creativity.

Like random tables are fun tools because you point you into a direction, but rather Glumdark is just spits out a sequence of words you have to assign directions to.

https://preview.redd.it/zjoxbgqz5rje1.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba38a19343ef1e5f47b3555e42b42472bac75345

Like what do I do with this? Hello Player, you receive a grim bullwhip of throat-punching? What does it do? How does it relate to the world the rules have laid out? What makes it weird? How does that weirdness manifest mechanically?

At that point I am not consulting a random table, but just creating homebrew with a random dark sounding title, which doesn't make the DM's job any easier.

So honestly while it does seem nice that Glumdark is system-agnostic, I can't help but feel that they might have shot themselves in the foot by being too general and just end up with a ""grim fantasy wacky words"" table, rather than a helpful and opinionated tool for DMs.

1129,71,1fzwk3q,Just a tale from my experience with old-school D&D,"After diving back into some old-school D&D (we're talking AD&D 1E and BX in my case), I can't help but feel like the magic of OSR isn't just nostalgia—it's the *simplicity* and sheer unpredictability that makes it a different beast. No skill checks for every tiny thing, no 300-page rulebook expansions—just you, your character, a rusty sword, and the DM's sadistic grin as you descend into a dungeon where everything *can* kill you (and probably will). 😈

There's something incredibly freeing about playing a game where survival is more about *player ingenuity* than just min-maxed stats. Modern D&D has its perks, but there's a thrill in knowing that a goblin with a pointy stick could end your character's journey faster than any dragon.

Also, the random tables... don't even get me started on the beauty of random encounters. You enter a room? BAM—you're in a pit of slime with an ancient cursed relic and no escape. You pick a lock? BOOM—turns out it's a mimic, and now you're fighting for your life. OSR keeps you on your toes in ways modern D&D just doesn't.

Anyone else feel like the OSR approach brings back that sense of danger and creativity that made early D&D so exciting? Sometimes, less really *is* more. Do you guys thinks it's even possible that modern D&D one day will get back to it's roots commercially speaking?

I recently completed a deep dive into every faction in the upcoming [Dolmenwood setting](https://necroticgnome.com/pages/about-dolmenwood). Some factions were even split into sub-factions, bringing the total to 16 factions! In my blog series, I explore how I prepared each of them for my game.

Check out the full series here: [Dolmenwood Factions Index](https://elmc.at/dolmenwood-factions-index/).  

---

### What's This About?

This series is an exploration of faction prep for Dolmenwood, based on a [framework I wrote about earlier this year](https://elmc.at/how-to-set-up-and-use-faction-turns/). It's heavily inspired by *Mausritter* with additional ideas from *Cairn*.  

The goal? To create a **dynamic, evolving world** for your players to interact with.

---

### Posts Include:

- ⚠️ **Spoiler Alert!** ⚠️ (Players, beware: Dolmenwood content ahead!)  
- **Deep Dives:** Detailed breakdowns of goals, actions, and more.  
- **Fresh Content:** New NPCs and resources to enrich your world.  
- **Inspiration in Action:** Real gameplay notes and examples.  

---

### What's in Each Post?

Each post explores a Dolmenwood faction in detail, breaking it down into actionable parts. Here's what's included:

1. **Goals and Milestones:**
   Every faction has goals—either taken from the Dolmenwood books or created to fill gaps. I also outline potential milestones: events that might occur as goals progress. These are flexible ideas, not set in stone.

2. **Resources:**
   Resources define a faction's strength and influence. I assign each faction at least three unique resources, drawn from descriptions in the books or extrapolated. During the course of a campaign, a faction might gain more or lose resources.

3. **Actions and Agents:**
   Actions represent what the faction is actively working on, and I outline three for each faction. For clarity, I break them into smaller tasks with potential follow-ups to spark inspiration. Agents—NPCs leading these actions—give your players clear interaction points.

4. **Further Thoughts:**
   This section is where I speculate! I brainstorm additional actions, challenges the faction might face, and long-term plans. These musings provide even more hooks to expand their role in your game.

5. **Alliances:**
   No faction exists in isolation. I explore likely alliances—whether with other factions, Fairy nobles, or local groups. These relationships add complexity to the world and drive inter-faction dynamics.

6. **Examples from My Game:**
   To ground everything, I share examples from my own campaign. These include notes from five faction turns for each faction and insights into how the outcomes affected my players or the overall narrative as well as the standing of the faction generally.

> **Note**
>
> I take liberties with some of the factions, either due to missing details or to better fit the themes of my campaign. These examples are tailored for my game, but I hope they inspire your own setups. Feel free to adapt them, change them, or use them as they are—whatever works best for your table. If you're short on time, these setups can save some legwork. I hope this series provides useful insights and ideas for your Dolmenwood adventures!

### Why I Did This

This blog series was my passion project for the year. I started it to share my faction framework but didn't expect to dive so deep—or to cover all 16 factions! It's been a rewarding experience, and I hope it helps others bring their campaigns to life.

Thanks for reading!

1133,75,1d7i471,Catacombs are Scarier Than You May Think.,"Many of us have sent our characters through tombs and catacombs to slay undead and plunder gold treasure. Mass burial sites are great. They're evocative, scary, and inspire heroism in the player characters. If we base our catacombs off of real world modules, they can be even greater.

The catacombs beneath Saint Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna is 2 floors deep, each 9 meters deep (27 feet deep). One wing of the first level holds a dozen coffins of the Dukes of Austria (including and unfortunate child-sized one), one room holds old and disrepaired statues, the rest of floor 1 and all of floor 2 are dedicated to the **11,000** people buried in a period of 40 years in the 1700s. Closed off rooms, windows showing mounds of bones floor to ceiling.

How does this apply to our OSR games? Well your basic skeleton gets pretty outclassed by midgame, so what if we put the players in an environment where they must fight thousands? An OSR-challenge would be ""how do we get the loot, while avoiding being mobbed by thousands of skeletons?""

 A straightforward solution to the ""weak skeleton"" problem would be by creating a ""bone swarm"" undead monster. An amalgamation of hundreds fractured souls and their bones, thrashing violently against the interlopers into their resting ground.

Most of our games exist in a pseudo-medieval period, as opposed to the enlightenment period the Vienna Catacombs were used by civilians. Solution: ancient fallen empire.

None of this is necessarily groundbreaking. The mains point is if you want to instill horror or inspire creativity in your players, don't populate your catacombs with a few dozen undead. Put a **few thousand** in there.",osr,1717455335.0,1,1673,279

You can read my full play report on [my blog](https://theundergroundlabyrinth.blogspot.com/2024/05/i-ran-tomb-of-horrorsand-it-didnt-suck.html) if you're interested. I refer to rooms throughout by number more than description though (I wanted to avoid too many spoilers) so it might be handy to have a map of the place as you read along.

But here's a super brief summary for those who don't want to read the whole thing:

I took the 20 pregens in the back of the module and converted them into OSE characters. Then I ran the tomb as an OSE one-shot where players would pick new characters up as the old ones died off. The group did really well and we started off strong! They fell victim to some of the early traps, and expertly defeated many of the others. But a lack of direction and some foolish decisions on my part caused the middle of the game to stall. Things picked back up at the end though when the players decided to throw caution to the wind and speed-run the rest of the dungeon. Overall consensus: we had fun on a Saturday night. And that's a win in my book.

Honestly, I think the truth of the tomb is that it's alright. It isn't one of the greatest dungeons of all time IMO, but it also isn't unplayable trash. It's one of those dungeons that I think can really shine if you put some elbow grease into it, and run it for your group as a novelty. But that means that I'd only recommend it for experienced game masters. Running the dungeon strictly as written risks some severe pacing problems. But I think those pacing problems can be overcome.

***You can play the game*** [here](https://duehringadam.itch.io/vermis)

A common pain point I have noticed with a lot of players is that when they discovered a secret path it was frustrating and obtuse to actually go on that secret path, so I have added a system when you discover a secret path, it will append the secret path to the visible exits on the player UI.

I added a journal function, so when you inspect important things, defeat important enemies, or enter notable areas, you should get a journal entry with tidbits of lore!

Started work on the Flutewood forest area, it is unfinished but there is one boss enemy to fight, and a journal to discover.

Added an option to disable the CRT effect in the settings tab.

The moving statues are now in the catacombs but they do not follow you.

Currently working on a system for when you interact with NPCs, some of them will give you an item once dialogue is finished, for now with the Drowsy Knight, you can give him the Thousand Eyes ring to receive the night watch mushrooms, you can also kill him for more! You can also give the thousand eyes to the lonely knight, if it doesn't work let me know!

Should hopefully have fixed some bugs regarding starting items being equipped on start.

Fixed a lot of other various bugs, hopefully!

***Constructive criticism or any feedback is welcome, and encouraged! Let me know what you guys think below or at the google forms*** [here](https://forms.gle/3zUwSuQqYPUCipMe8)",osr,1723428916.0,1,1576,271

Ever since I've gotten into the OSR ""philoshopy/ethos"" of play over the last few years, I've come to HEAVILY prefer randomization.

I have great interest in Buddhism and gnostic, meditative traditions and a through-line in many of these spiritual paths is that the greatest thing you can do is to remove your ""self"" from the equation of reality and let reality exist on its own terms... this creates the truest (not necessarily the best) outcomes and leads often to the most honest art.

I see this echoed in the OSR to such a potent extent and it fits so perfectly with my philosophy on art and life.

charts for wilderness discoveries, random encounters, monster reactions, loot tables, etc... create a world from what the dice tell you, from what reality tells you!  remove your ""self"" from the equation and see what the world creates for you.

The OSR and OSE especially facilitate this type of play (imo) greater than any other system.

1146,90,1j4b3m4,ZINE: A Voyage to Fomalhaut,"[A Voyage to Fomalhaut](https://preview.redd.it/0w5wwpdj6xme1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c428c9f304dca51c505838c9cd71da4c496a4ea)

I am pleased to announce the publication of **A Voyage to Fomalhaut**, a 48-page setting primer, and the 100th EMDT release. This guide is suitable for both players and GMs, and presents a setting with strong sword & sorcery and sword & planet influences. The guide updates and expands on the 2008 writeup in **Fight On!** magazine #03, reflecting the one and a half decade of gaming that has taken place in the setting since that point.

*“Fomalhaut is a world whose origins coincide with the discussions that formed the modern understanding of old-school gaming in the mid-2000. Inspired by the rediscovery of Judges Guild (particularly Wilderlands of High Fantasy), the “Appendix N” books, and the stranger aspects of old-school play, it is a distillation of influences that make these games distinct and powerful.*

*This is a setting of bold sword & sorcery, where the Techno-Hellenic age fell in destructive interstellar wars, and was succeeded by one of iron and bronze. Here, the descendants of Man have fractured into a myriad strange societies in a changed world, some warlike, some reclusive, and some surprisingly civilised. Philosophy, religion, and cultural variety are rife with exception and local colour. But “in every age, in every place, the deeds of men remain the same” – and for all its strangeness, this setting, and the adventures you can find therein, should be immediately recognisable to fans of sword & sorcery adventure.*

*And where adventures are concerned, Fomalhaut can offer them in abundance: in barren wastelands dotted with the remnants of fallen empires, on wine-dark seas where splendid isles and reclusive civilisations await, in teeming cities where life is cheap and the sword can gain what even money cannot buy, deep underground in forgotten vaults and subterranean lands; and perhaps even beyond – in strange dimensions and the domains of mirages and dreams. Men of many devices shall win it all, while those who shrink back shall be forever forgotten!”*

More detailed setting information and a preview of the deities section is found in [this post](https://beyondfomalhaut.blogspot.com/2024/12/blog-towards-fomalhaut-and-what-it-is.html).

The booklet includes the following materials:

* An introduction to the setting 4000 years after its foundation by a starfaring civilisation, and some 3200 after this civilisation’s downfall.
* A writeup of Fomalhaut’s gods and ideologies, and the practices of worship for Clerics, divine champions dedicated to a god’s cause, as well as laymen. 28 deities are discussed from Kang the Thousand-Eyed, rapacious God of Adventurers; and Mereskan the Bat-God, patron of thieves; to the Followers of the LOGOS, a sect of philosophers dedicated to the arts of mathematics and geometry; and the Idolators of Dhakam, a barbarous cult worshipping crumbling idols in the wastelands.
* A description of Fomalhaut’s regions, with its colourful mosaic of civilisations. Visit the ruined landscape of the Worn Lands, discover the mysteries of the Plateau of Ong whose cruel monks allow no stranger intruding on their domain to live, and sail seas hiding fantastic islands and fallen utopias.
* A brief guide to adventuring in the setting, with its people – from the mammoth-hunting cavemen of the northern ice wastes to the decadent descendants of the Empire of Mung, masters of ancient technologies.
* A two-sided setting overview map, with one side drawn by Sean Stone.

**A Voyage to Fomalhaut** features cover art by Peter Mullen, and interiors by Cameron Hawkey, Graphite Prime, and various Golden Age illustrators (including some by the incomparable Virginia Frances Sterrett). The print version of the supplement is available from my [**Bigcartel store**](https://emdt.bigcartel.com/); the PDF edition will be published through DriveThruRPG with a few months’ delay. As always, customers who buy the print edition will receive the PDF version free of charge.

# Various thoughts:

First things first: I wanna express how amazing it is that so many people have tried out my game, I am incredibly grateful to all of you who played, and another thanks to those who left feedback either here or on the [itch.io](http://itch.io) game!  


Scope of the game is increasing with adding these new systems, which means it will take longer in the future to push out updates, which hopefully won't be too long between, remember: I am doing it alone!  


I noticed people were having a lot of trouble with how specific the old command processor was and how it wasn't very contextual. I took it upon myself to write a new one from scratch and it should be super flexible and have context based on whats happening in the game. If you find any bugs with it, make sure to let me know!

>How it should function is that no matter how many words you type it will parse your commands (to a reasonable extent).  
this would function like this 

>go to the freaking left idiot computer  
You go left!

I've been laying the groundwork for a leveling system and part of that groundwork is items that have certain stat requirements, don't be surprised if you pick up an item and you cant wear it! In a future update you should be able to level up.

I've been thinking about the scope of the game, and what a game requires versus what the Vermis guide provides, I am on the fence about only putting things in the game that the artbook had, or adding in my own to fill in some gaps. I've done a bit of both but I really want feedback on this one!

1148,92,1fl3n6n,The new rule on AI content is not clear at all,"As the title says, this is a half-baked rule that was frankly not thought through in its current form.

For example, Heroes of Adventure is a system that was getting some notice on here a while back. That system's art is (I believe entirely) AI-generated. Is all discussion of Heroes of Adventure now banned on here? If a link to Heroes of Adventure content is posted on here and it shows some of the art, will that get the poster banned? Is discussion of Heroes of Adventure's aesthetic banned? Only if someone links to some of the art as an example? Unclear.

What about products that use some AI art here and there, but are mostly not AI-generated? Allowed for discussion? Linking? Does it make a difference whether or not the cover art is AI?

If an online sandbox generator uses some kind of machine learning, is that banned? Are we banned from linking to it? From posting results it generates?

I'm not particularly attached to AI art, and I certainly don't want the sub to get clogged with AI spam. Some of my favorite creators absolutely despise it (e.g. David McGrogan).

But I don't think my preferences should control what other people are allowed to post, and I don't understand why the mods skipped over the intermediate position of simply requiring all AI content to be clearly tagged so that those who want to downvote can do so.

These are the kinds of problems you run into when you rush out a rule in a fit of indignation with no meaningful discussion, while most of your community is asleep. I don't care to see AI-generated art. But this seems like yet another step in the direction of running this subreddit in an autocratic manner, where the mods impose their judgments and preferences from on high, instead of letting the voting system do its job and express the will of the community.

1150,94,1gqqwsb,Will gonzo high-level play ever make its way into the modern OSR scene?,"The recent thread comparing 5E unfavourably for its overpowered PCs got me thinking about how selective the OSR movement is about approaches to play in the early D&D scene. You just have to flip through something like the original Rogue’s Gallery to see high-powered, gonzo PCs drawn the real games of TSR’s stable of writers and their friends.

Nothing captures the gonzo high-level play of yore like the Day of the Dwarf, an actual play account by TSR designer Roger Moore, published in Dungeon magazine issue 42 (Oct 1980):

>“We were setting up for one of our high level adventures; there was a rumour in the area where we lived of a new monster lair, in the Firefall Mountains to the West, that held unparalleled treasures. We had most of the known artifacts, but this sounded like something different. We agreed it was going to be worth a try.

>”It was going to be too unwieldy to bring all of our henchmen, hirelings, and armies, so each of us brought only our main player-character, steed, and familiars as required. Joanna brought her Paladin lady and her horse with the mithril barding, and managed to get special dispensation from her church (The First Temple of Wonder Woman) to bring all seven of her holy swords. Alan took his storm giant and mattock of the titans, and led the party alongside Jerry’s golden dragon character. Jerry griped a lot because he couldn’t take Farah, Kate, and Jacqueline, his henchdragons, but Dan had been firm. Belinda got her brownie, her homonculous, and her two golf bag full of wands, staves, rods, an scepters, and saddled up her unicorn, riding beside George’s arch-Druid/Bard, and Isaac’s eleven Ranger/Cleric/Magic-User with the mutant horse (he called it Bruce or something) he’d gotten on another plane. I took out my caveman and +5 vorpal battleaxe, and became the rear-guard. Above us flew Margie and her pegasus, serving as air cover and emergency medic (16th level clerics are much appreciated in our group). Margie worked as a nurse in the hospital downtown, and she fit the role of cleric well. Before setting out, we agreed as a group to hold down psionics and we swore not to summon any gods into the adventure; we’d been quested so many times that we know the Abyss like the back of our hands.”

I’m curious if this approach to D&D will ever be revived by the OSR scene, or if the OSR brand and ethos are too firmly wedded to low-level, lower-powered play.",osr,1731540681.0,1,2420,421

1156,101,1dlhihv,Players find it more profitable to hunt other parties than to go deeper in the dungeon,"I'm running a mega-dungeon (my Dungeon23 project) with WWN where multiple parties share a camp outside the dungeon. XP is awarded based on any recovered loot's value in silver. Recently, my players wiped out an entire adventuring party, except one survivor who escaped. The looted gear, mainly armor, was quite valuable. Now, my players prefer hunting other adventuring parties over exploring deeper levels of the dungeon.

I've heard that ""players will optimize the fun out of a game,"" and personally I think going deeper is much more fun than hunting other parties on the early levels. Plus, the survivor's return to camp will likely prompt other parties to make some strong counter attacks.

Do you have any fun ideas for how the other parties might respond? Just some ideas of my own:

* The rivals start forming larger teams

I think it’s the best toolkit adventure that WOTC has put out in recent years. I ran this in 5e and there were still multiple PC deaths (and could have easily been about 6 more).

PROS 

* point-crawl sandbox 
* 10 starting villages with maps, NPCs, local factions, and quests 
* \~two dozen mini-dungeons to drop into your game (or replace with your own) 
* fun factions with conflicting goals that allow players to make allies and enemies 
* Wilderness encounters are decent and some of the locations in this section are ones I will drop into games for years. 
* Deadly. 
* Plenty of drag and drop content like: a fallen magi-tech city, a duergar fortress dungeon, panopticon prison, mountainside goblin fort, crashed spelljammer, and more. 
* Arctic DnD is badass. 
* Can easily pivot the adventure into a new direction by emphasizing certain locations/factions over others. Examples: aliens in the arctic, underdark invasion, witches & cults infiltrating rural towns, wrath of a winter goddess, etc.

CONS 

* The sandbox narrows to a linear plot in the later chapters (but you could completely ignore that) 
* WOTC layout. They don't build their books for ease of use at the table, but the first couple chapters are better laid out than the last few (meh). 
* The ""endings"" that they planned for/expected are disorganized. 
* The motivation of the BBEG is not clearly stated. 
* 5e vanilla fantasy aesthetic (I pushed it toward grittier low-fantasy)

This was one of the most fun campaigns my table ever played. My players enjoy both old-school play and “big damn quest” style games, but this played like an old school game more than any other 5e content we have used.

At one point a player recalls that there was a pit trap where one of their characters fell and died during the rout.  With maps they made before, they successfully find the corpse, use their equipment (equipment!) to lower themselves into the pit trap and discover his rotting corpse, as well as 400 gold pieces!  Cha-ching. 

But as they collect the gold and move on in the darkness to find the gem of power, the corpse of their fallen comrade begins to stir, reawakened by the disturbance and the presence of powerful ancient magic...

So, no combat here. Just tense, grim-dark exploration vibes, and player-driven emergent storytelling.

1166,111,1dlxqh3,B/X is Deadly,"Every couple months while I am working on my own material I pull out Keep on the Borderlands, to me it is the North Star of adventure design. Less than 30 pages include the rules (4 pages), town (5.5 pages), wilderness (1.5 pages), maps & resources (11 pages including the slip cover), & the dungeon (10 pages for 64 rooms).

Now, every time I read it (countless times) or run it (6+) something new sticks out that makes me pause. Last time I made a post similar to this it was Gygax indicating that you should just GIVE the players some healing potions and a magic dagger to start!

This time the passage that gave me pause is on page 14 (which actually has a ton of great advice - literally the prototype of ""The Monsters Know What They're Doing""):

""Ransoming Prisoners: Organized tribes can optionally be allowed to take player characters prisoner, freeing one to return to the KEEP in order to bring a ransom back to free the captives. Set the sums low - 10 to 100 gold pieces (or a magic item which the ransoming monsters would fine useful) per prisoner. If the ransom is paid, allow the characters to go free. Then, without telling the players, assume that this success brought fame to the capturing monsters, so their numbers will be increased by 2-12 additional members, and the tribe will also be very careful to watch for a return of the adventurers seeking revenge for their humiliating captivity. The period of extra alertness will last 1-4 weeks; the increase in numbers is permanent.""

It is another fascinating look at what it meant to ""die"" in old school D&D and strongly ties into the pulp fantasy roots of the hobby where heroes weren't killed outright, they were captured, humiliated, and then came back seeking revenge.

So ask yourself, how deadly is old school D&D? What if death isn't actually the end of a character, it's just part of the gameplay loop? Especially with flatter power curves, stripping a fighter of their gear or a magic user of their spell books is tantamount to deleveling them significantly - and for many players a fate worse than death.

1169,114,1e2h9c0,"Our OSR Experience, 16 Months In: Part I","I've seen some posts on here where people have discussed how they got into the OSR scene and their subsequent experiences.  I personally found them really fascinating and informative, so I wanted to share my experience too.

**This will be long, like really long, so I know many won't want to read this all, and that's okay.**  This will be sort of a combination of a ""play report"" and ""running the game"" type post, along with a general story about how a bunch of people who started playing back in 3.5 Ed, along with some TTRPG newbies ended up, we think, capturing lightning in a bottle by exploring new systems and tailoring them a bit to suit our exact preferences, (consider this paragraph to be your TL;DR).

I titled it ""Part I"" because I wanted to focus on our journey into the OSR and how our game is going with this post.  I want to save the worldbuilding / playstyle stuff for Part II (if people are interested) as we now have multiple parties running around in a shared persistent world with ""strict timekeeping"" with just under 20 regular players total across a few tables, and I feel that should be a separate post.  Though this post will focus on the original group of players that started it all.

*Skip the first two paragraphs below this if background info doesn't interest you.*

For some background: most of us, me included, are mid-30s millennials who started playing TTRPGs and DMing them right around the time 3.5 Ed was new as freshmen/sophomores in high school.  Rapidly, many of us got into White Wolf and other systems (including non-TTRPGs too, like Warhammer, board games, LARPs and more).  Several of us played/ran games 3+ days a week during undergrad in the late 2000s.  Me in particular, I tried to get into 5th Ed, and found a lot that I liked with that edition (backgrounds, in particular, and the various sub-class builds I found awesome).  But for whatever reason, the overall game just didn't click with me, and for the first time I felt no desire to run a game.  So instead, I took a 6-ish year hiatus from TTRPGs to focus on career and grad school stuff.

COVID hits, gaming stops (save an online Starfinder game I played in, which rapidly ~~deteriorated~~ evolved into Futurama meets Spaceballs on acid, it was great). But then, in 2020/2021, I came across a KS for OSE: AF, and I backed everything, ordering Classic Fantasy as well.  When I finally had them all, I read everything nearly cover to cover.  Multiple times for certain sections (race-as-class was so confusing to me at first).  I discover this subreddit, I read all of the primers for old-school gaming, I watch interviews and some actual-plays from a bunch of different YT channels, I discover Questing Beast's channel, I scour forums to learn more about the style, you get the idea.

I start dusting off my homebrew world that I've been toying with since \~2012, and in winter/spring 2023, I decide to run a strictly RAW OSE: Classic Fantasy 2-3 shot game to learn the system, using The Hole in the Oak.  The party consisted of 5 players, most of whom have played tons of different TTRPGs, but not really anything in the OSR space.

In short, we overall had a great time.  We really liked the minimal feeling of separation between the player and the PC which allowed for easy immersion, as well as the flexibility provided by a light rules set, and to us, how it allowed for greater narrative creativity for both players and DM.  The speed of getting characters to the table and how easily situations in-game could be adjudicated were other strong selling points to us, as many of us had grown tired of rules-lawyering, or of pausing the action for 10 minutes to look up some esoteric rule published on WoTC's website back in 2005 and now only available on the internet archive.

Another major pro was the assumed playstyle, namely the lack of balanced encounters, which they felt made the game more alive and realistic by weaving a strong sense of danger...which goes back to that feeling of immersion.  Gold=XP, at first, seemed strange to us all, but once we all understood that ""outsmarting the evil ogre and stealing his gems"" yields basically the same XP as ""risking your lives to try to fight the evil ogre in order to take his gems,"" we understood it better.  And it provided a major disincentive to act like murder-hobos, which was important to me, as I'd grown tired of the ""let's just fight everything"" mentality.

The lower PC power levels and general de-emphasis on ""build optimization"" were well-received too, they said it made the characters more relatable at low levels, and gave a strong sense of accomplishment when they overcame stronger foes and made it back to safety with captured treasure.  ""I can't relate to being a superhero, I don't know how to roleplay that, but I can easily imagine having imposter syndrome and being unsure of my own abilities in a scary world"" is one thing that a player said that stuck with me.

A few things initially were counterintuitive until they started to click, like ""roll under"" ability checks and the dreaded THAC0, but for the most part we got used to it all by a few sessions in.  Same goes for the ""lack of unified mechanics"" as provided by the % chance for thief skills, X-in-6 chances for certain things, and d20 for others, all were a bit of a learning curve, but we soon found it fun, unique, and even somewhat charming.

Now, what a few of us didn't like about OSE: Classic Fantasy (at the time) were race-as-class, the lack of additional character customization options, race-based level caps, and the age-old ""thief skills are confusing, if they can hide does that mean the rest of us can't?"" type stuff (we did deeper research and sorted that one out, thanks to this subreddit actually).

For another example, while they liked the idea of retainers/hirelings for general labor and guarding their camp, they didn't like the idea of sharing XP with them, nor having them in dungeons, and they didn't want to do a ton of roleplay with them, which honestly, was all fine with me.    
  
But, regarding our first impressions on the OSR, the important takeaway here is this: we thought the style of play and overall rules set had a ton of potential which was absolutely worth exploring, we just knew we had to mold it a bit to suit our preferences.

So we decided to start another game, this time with OSE: AF, plus Secondary Skills, and a handful of house-rules that were custom tailored for our desired playstyle (max HP at first level; 3d6 down the line became 3d6 then allocate as desired; we used variable weapon damage; we brought in a few of the more ""traditional"" extra races/classes from Carcass Crawler; no ""slow"" weapons; 3d6's DTL's Feats of Exploration for additional XP; we introduced ability score progression as per D&D 3.5, so +1 to one ability score every 4th level; plus a few others).  Another player (with essentially zero TTRPG experience) joins us, bringing it to 6 players plus DM.  One player chose ""cartographer"" for their secondary skill, and became our dungeon mapper, using a notebook of graphing paper that I provided.  We assign out Caller and Quartermaster roles too.

The game's an open world sandbox set in my homebrew world, to which I dropped in a *heavily* edited Wormskin-era Dolmenwood as a geographic area, not as a rule set, (conveniently, I knew exactly where a ""weird, fae-touched woodland"" zone was in the world, I just never fleshed it out, but Gavin it seems did that for me, though I do also pull in stuff from the Dolmenwood books that I backed already too, so it's not \*just\* Wormskin, more on that in Part II).

The party has a blast, and immediately they're running around the region, befriending important NPCs, discovering points of interest, going on missions, and interacting with the world in tons of unique ways.  OSE: AF plus a few house rules was the perfect solution for us, and we found that tweaking BX to suit the desires of a table was easy, intuitive, and hard to ""break.""

Collaborative worldbuilding emerges as players flesh out regions of the world through both gameplay and backstories (i.e. the Wood Elf players develop a story about their homeland being destroyed prior to the start of the game, the Dwarf players all leave their mountain kingdom because ""something started feeling off back home,"" tons of adventure seeds to work with).

Meanwhile, I had no intricate long term plan for the game, no overarching narrative story that I was going to force on them, leaving everything up to player-led action to decide what direction the game went in.  I did have factions and moving pieces in the background and things happening, but the players had to interact with the world to learn about and affect those things.  And they loved it, more than I ever could have imagined.  They felt like they were autonomous individuals in a living fantasy world as opposed to characters in someone else's pre-planned story (paraphrasing their words, not mine, and I credit them with that, not myself, as they're the ones leading the action).  In short, the game feels like its running itself, at times.

Some relatives (zero TTRPG experience) come to visit, and they join us for a few sessions last summer, where we ran a slightly tweaked Winter's Daughter as a one-shot with 8 players, followed by another short adventure (Tannic).  They pick up the game rather quickly, finding it relatively easy to learn and immediately jumping into roleplay.

At the time, that was the most fun I'd ever had running a game before.  The players were super engaged, they overcame obstacles through roleplay and clever thinking, and took literal pages of notes on what they encountered.  They rapidly learned that very often ""the answer isn't on your character sheet"" and started applying various problem solving methods to in-game situations via outside the box thinking.  They also learned that simply trying to attack everything would lead to PC death.  And combat with 8 PC's at the table was still faster than 3.5 Ed with 3-4 players (I say that as someone who still has a soft spot for that system, I'm certainly not bashing it, or any other system for that matter).

This will be covered more in the Part II of this post, but my relatives return back home around the time that more friends become interested in old school gaming.  So earlier this year I start a second game, online, and get my relatives back into the game with their same characters, along with about 10 other players for an open table campaign centered around a modified and hugely expanded Keep on the Borderlands sandbox that I placed beyond the western border of Dolmenwood.  And that's going strong now too, with crossover between the parties here and there.

The in-person game continues, and the party runs through modified versions of The Incandescent Grottoes and other adventures, some from the TSR era, all tailored in various ways, plus some homebrew adventures.  We bring in the travel/camping/hex-crawling mechanics from the Dolmenwood books, and the party spends entire sessions just exploring areas of interest, and the party cartographer starts documenting what they find in each hex, making notes such as ""we're probably not ready for whatever we heard roaring in that cave, we should come back later.""

The roleplay gets dialed up to 11, with each character having such a distinct personality that they sometimes find themselves at odds with each other over how to proceed in a given situation, and they resolve it all in character, sometimes with actual yelling.  I've never seen roleplay so animated outside of a LARP environment, ever, and during college I played at a table with a couple of theatre majors, for what it's worth.

At present, we're all still truly having a blast with the game, it keeps our attention even during 9-10 hour marathon sessions, and we're always wanting to play more than our schedules permit.

We're thinking that with the present party alone, we have another 1-2 years of gameplay left, with their goal being to reach Domain level play, for which several of them are already laying the early groundwork.  We haven't ruled out utilizing Marsh's Companion book when it comes out either, and/or using BECMI as something of a template for higher level progression.  Or, doing some geo-political domain level stuff with the current PC's and switching back and forth between that and playing fresh level 1 PC's who are associated with the others, (i.e. a new level 1 MU is a pupil of the current party's arcanist once they have their wizard tower, stuff like that).

Our D&D group chat is constantly booming, both with game related discussions as well as unrelated stuff, and each player has a list of things that they still want to do in-game.  People bring up the game during parties unprompted, folks who play in one game talk to players from the other to exchange information (we have an in-character means of accomplishing this too).

Part of me wishes that we discovered old school play much earlier, as this is honestly the type of experience I've been looking for since the early 2000s when I first started out.  But at the same time, I think that our prior gaming experiences helped inform us of our likes and dislikes, and set us up better for the present game.

We're having so much fun, and I just had to share this with all of you, because I didn't know who else to talk to about this!

(If there's interest, I'll continue this in Part II sometime in the next week, where I'll talk about collaborative worldbuilding, running multiple games in a shared world, timekeeping, verisimilitude, factions, and more)

Or something

Tldr: Is Japanese fantasy currently more OSR than Western fantasy?

I live in a very rural and sparsely populated area. Everyone who I can get in touch with who wants to play a tabletop game only wants to do 5e. Other systems simply don't exist locally. 

Well, I'm trying to change that. Advertising online for a rather small-medium (under 10 sessions) in-person 'dnd' campaign, using Black Wyrm of Brandonsford for OSE at my tiny local game store. Nothing super crazy or big additions, just semi RAW B/X Basic with some light touches. Milqutoast as it gets.

So people come to inquire, ""Can I play homebrew classes?"" ""What races do you allow?"" ""Here's my character concept"" ""This is for 5e?"" 

I look at it all and try to approximate the best response to these Gen Z hotshots. 

""So Dungeon Meshi, right? And Berserk? Okay, now combine those two."" - ""Ohhhhh. I get it. Sure."" 

I only have passing familiarity with both of those IPs. I'm not super keen on Japanese fantasy media. I played Final Fantasy 10 when I was, well, 10. 

And yet somehow, it clicks that the best way I can explain in an elevator pitch what the concept of B/X is, is not any comparisons to Lord of the Rings (not actually that many young people have seen or read it) or Conan the Barbarian or even just describing a trimmed down 5th Edition Forgotten Realms or even Baldurs Gate. 

I now have to categorize and appeal to Japanese fantasy media to justify not playing 5e.

And then it clicks again; is it just me or does the current generation (or perhaps fixation) of Japanese Fantasy in video games, manga and anime resemble and in media, preserve, OSR and post-OSR (or just Gygaxian fantasy) concepts more than most modern Western fantasy iterations? I could go on and on, but I think you might get the point. 

Im not a JRPG or Japanese-Western fantasy afficionado, so feel free to correct me if I misunderstand or misworded specific ideas.

Just substantial enough to add atmosphere without snarling up the roads.

After this miracle, a second: The late Jim Ward's good friend Harold ""Wisconsin"" Johnson, known for Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan and others, stepped up to run his planned Metamorphosis Alpha game. Frankly, I can't think of a better tribute.

There were many more fateful meetings. Matt Finch and Suzy Moseby of Mythmere Games surprised me in the halls, as last I heard they wouldn't be able to make it. Turns out some badges became available at the last minute. Wonderful people always.

There was Harold Johnson as mentioned, of course.

Steve Sullivan, who told me about a Manos: Hands of Fate game he'll be releasing soon. This guy gets me. Now I know there's at least one other person into D&D and Manos memorabilia.

Mike Carr and I talked about how his air combat rules from Dawn Patrol/Fight in the Skies made it into D&D and how his innovation of persistent pilot avatars foreshadowed D&D's leveling system.

Chatted for a sec with Daniel from the Bandit's Keep YouTube channel chilling by the bar fireplace.

Pat Kilbane, also hella tall, was kind enough to sign my copy of the documentary he just put out, the Dreams in Gary's Basement.

The last major event of the day was a foray into the mother of all dungeons, Blackmoor Castle, as refereed by original Blackmoor player and current campaign head, Bob Meyer. He set us on a chaotic (yet successful!) quest to retrieve the Wizard of the Wood's missing apprentice and some magic well water from the orc, troll, and balrog-infested maze. What a ride! And what a challenge to map, I might add! Cartographic crises aside, the game was a lot of fun. In true Blackmoor tradition, we threw 2d6 for most everything and none of us knew our characters' stats. One interesting twist is that we were all told to pick one special skill or power, which could be anything we could imagine. I chose uncanny luck, another player picked marksmanship, a third brawling, and so on. One guy even tried to make the going easier by saying his character had a knack for making a torch out of anything. With the main raw material on hand being dead orcs, the ""pork torch"" was born. At the end of the session, we returned triumphant and Bob had a photographer come in and take a proper group portrait with a professional camera that we then all got free physical copies of. What a class act! You know that's going on the wall.

Well, I've rambled on enough. I need to get some rest because my next game starts bright and early tomorrow and it's not technically at Gary Con....",osr,1711170360.0,1,3835,691

* BlueMountainBooks has released a free hexcrawl on itch, inspired by Luke Gearing's Wolves Upon the Coast. [**~At the Base of Blue Mountain~**](https://bluemountainbooks.itch.io/at-the-base-of-blue-mountain) includes seven dungeons, nearly sixty hexes, and more.
* [**~Ventis~** ](https://gmshail.itch.io/ventis)was an entry in the Vaarn Summer jam, and is a city located at the edge of Vaarn. The art is really stunning in a minimalist, Vaarnian sort of way. I think this is a great little product to pick up either for Vaarn or to mine for ideas to plop into other settings.
* Another Vaarn adventure is [**~Penumbral Oasis, Part One~**](https://siofragames.itch.io/penumbral-oasis-part-one), a three level dungeon for characters of level 1-3.
* [**~Trouble at Bigby's Meadery~**](https://snailsong.itch.io/trouble-at-bigbys-meadery) is a system-neutral, lighthearted adventure that packs a surprising amount of content into 34 pages. It's the publisher's first product, which is always really great to see.
* Dice Goblin Games has published [**~Deep Delve~**](https://dicegoblingames.itch.io/deep-delve-dungeon-cairn), an adventure inspired by The Stygian Library and compatible with either Block, Dodge, Parry or Cairn. If you're looking for an adventure set in an abandoned dwarven mine this is the one for you. It's also available through [**~Drivethrurpg~**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/491825/deep-delve-adventure-for-cairn-block-dodge-parry?affiliate_id=253473).
* [**~Dark Tales for Dark Times~** ](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/488558/dark-tales-for-dark-times-bundle?affiliate_id=253473)is an OSR bundle now available on Drivethrurpg. It features eight publications by different authors, some adventures, some supplements, that all are written for OSR-style games. It looks to be a good bundle to pick up to get a sampling of some lesser-known OSR authors.
* I'm a sucker for a good kids on bikes game, and [**~Teenage Oddyssey~**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/485035/teenage-oddyssey?affiliate_id=253473) (not a typo) is another entry into the genre, this one embracing the awkwardness and humor of adolescence. The art is spot on and really captures the vibe. This game uses the Mark of the Odd system used by Into the Odd and others.
* One of my favorite things about doing this roundup is when I get to mention a game that is crowdfunding and then it pops up as published some time later, and I get to plug it again! [**~The Parthenogenesis of Hungry Hollow~**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/491687/the-parthenogenesis-of-hungry-hollow?affiliate_id=253473) is one of these. It's the first hardback adventure written for Liminal Horror. It also features art by one of my favorite artists: Amanda Lee Franck.
* Another such adventure is the seacrawl [**~Wind Wraith~**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/491592/wind-wraith-a-generative-wavecrawl-setting-toolkit?affiliate_id=253473), by Lazy Litch, who has really found a niche putting out spooky, creepy mini-settings and games.
* Continuing with the nautical theme, [**~The Undying Sea~**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/491441/the-undying-sea?affiliate_id=253473), by Dungeon Age Adventures, is an Into the Odd game set in a dying world.
* I'm in the process of harvesting peppers as the growing season begins to wind down, so it was perhaps serendipity that I stumbled across [**~The Chili Rat Chiefs~**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/491351/the-chili-rat-chiefs?affiliate_id=253473), an Into the Odd (lots of stuff for ItO this week!) adventure, a fun little short scenario that would work well as a one-shot.",osr,1724064045.0,1,3698,474

1178,123,1hu8ltu,"If the encounter is balanced, runaway!","I always hear about the DMs worrying about creating balance encounters. 

And to this I always respond ""in 5e a balanced encounter is when will you kill all the monsters before any of the PCS die"". In osr a balanced encounter is when you kill the monsters before all the PCs die.

In other words a balanced encounter is equal to a fair fight. And it would be foolish to engage in a fight to the death that your party has equal odds of losing. At best one or two of you might survive.

What you really want is a fight of overwhelming odds when you kill all the monsters before any of you die but that is hardly balanced.

far more important than creating a ""balanced"" encounter is telegraphing to your players the difficulty of the encounter so they can decide whether and how to engage with it.

I share a few ideas on how to do that in my blog post.

1179,124,1hfi5iq,"OSR News Roundup for December 16th, 2024","The first OSR News Roundup was December 20th, 2021, and for three years I've been able to maintain a regular posting schedule, with a break here and there. I started doing this as a way to create a blogging ""habit"" and have kept going for about 150 of these. I hope y'all have found some fun and new games through the Roundup; I know that I have.

It's been awhile since I posted what I think of as the Roundup ground rules, and figure I might as well do it again going into the fourth year.

1. I only post about products that have been released in the past week or have launched a crowdfunding project in the past week. When I started I would post links to pre-launch pages, as well, but I've switched over to only promoting active projects. It helps me keep track of what I've promoted, and I think you (the creator) get a bigger bang for the buck.
2. What started out as just OSR releases has morphed to include indie titles, as well.
3. All of the Drivethru links I post are affiliate links, which means that I get a small percent of any sales. This does not take anything away from the publisher's profit, and if given a choice between promoting a product on itch or another similar platform or Drivethru I always try and promote a non-Drivethru link.
4. This list is curated! I purposefully do not include products from alt-right publishers, and where possible I give priority to works by BIPOC, women, and other minority groups. Also, I under no circumstances will promote products that use AI.
5. I don't promote blog or substack posts; there are other places that do a good job collating these.
6. Other than affiliate links, I'm not paid (in either cash or product) to promote these products.
7. If you've got something you would like to see promoted please send me a message (via socials or my email at thirdkingdomgames at gmail dot com) and I'll see what I can do; sometimes I miss stuff!
8. I admit to using the Roundup to promote my own work, but I do try and put it at the bottom of the list so that others get higher priority.

That's about it. Thanks for reading, and here's to another three years! This is a bit of a short roundup; I'm guessing most folks are busy with holiday stuff.

* The Great Lakes Game Library has released [**Tales from the Northwoods**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/503649/tall-tales-of-the-northwoods?affiliate_id=253473), a collection of beasts, maps, and adventures written for Cairn and inspired by the myths and legends of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan.
* The [**Sepulchre of Dust**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/397540171/sepulchre-of-dusk-revised-edition-for-shadowdark-rpg?ref=3pqibt) is currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter. This is a revised edition of the introductory Shadowdark adventure, and includes updated VTT maps for both players and GMs.
* MeatCastle GameWare has released the [**Light in the Fridge**](https://meatcastlegameware.itch.io/the-light-in-the-fridge), a Honey Heist inspired game where you play leftovers in the fridge trying to reach the top shelf to replace a light before it burns out forever.
* The other Todd (Hexed Press) has released [**Simple Hex Map Icons**](https://hexedpress.itch.io/simple-hex-map-icons) to itch. Pursuant to my interests, they include a selection of icons for use to create hex maps; right now they're just available for use in GIMP-based maps, but Todd is hoping to expand the collection to be usable by other programs, as well.
* Fanterland has released [**Feathertail Falls**](https://fanterland.itch.io/feathertail-falls), a collection of adventures and setting for Mausritter, featuring mice that can fly. The art in this release is pretty stunning.

* Joel Hines has released the [**Shrike**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/501615/the-shrike?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473), an adventure and setting by Leo Hunt that crowdfunded at the beginning of the year. It's a gorgeous, weird, sandbox style-adventure set in an abandoned corner of Hell. Right now it is only available in pdf, but I believe the print versions should be out soon.

It leads to tense moments where your arrows or torches are close to running out.

That said, after years of running games with strict encumbrance rules I have yet to see my players actually ever experience that or enjoy the encumbrance mechanic.

I hope I am just doing something wrong and can fix it so my players get to experience the tense fun I intend to offer them, but I am starting to wonder if maybe I should give up and just stop caring about encumbrance.

1183,129,1i62dx5,OSR Shift from Advanced to Basic?,"Back when I got connected with the OSR in 2009 or so, it seemed like almost everything was focused on AD&D and its derivatives (e.g. OSRIC). I was mostly on Dragonsfoot back in those days.

I'm just getting back into it after ~12 years of not playing, and it seems like the OSR is very focused on Basic D&D and successors nowadays. When did this change happen? What caused it?",osr,1737410385.0,1,376,70
1184,130,1j1gtxt,I wrote an OSR-inspired fantasy novel,"I've just published my OSR-inspired fantasy novel, *House of the Rain King*. I think if you're into old school D&D, you'll love this book! But rather than giving you the regular pitch that I give to fantasy fans, I thought I'd talk about the OSR influences and how the book developed from an adventure module into a novel.

Way back, probably 6 or 7 years ago, I was reading James Raggi's *Better Than Any Man.* This adventure module had a lot of issues, but I fell in love with its core mechanic. In the module, the Swedish army is sweeping across the land and killing everything in its path. The army moves across the hexmap each day according to a schedule, and when they reach a town or adventure site, they destroy everything there. If the players didn't go to that site, too bad - it's gone now.

At the same time I was reading Michael Swanwick's classic sci-fi novel *Stations of the Tide*, which is about a planet suffering a once-in-a-generation high tide that will flood the entire continent.

The two ideas combined in my head as an adventure module where the PCs visit a valley that is gradually flooding. There would be a hexmap showing the growth of the river and lake each day, until finally everything is underwater. There would also be dungeons that flood from the bottom up, potentially submerging treasure but also sometimes opening new pathways.

I found a lot of dynamism in this premise. When floods come, people have to abandon lots of material possessions, so there would be plenty of opportunities for the PCs to grab stuff if they are willing to risk the rising waters. 

Around this time I also read Raggi's *The God That Crawls,* a dungeon containing a single invincible monster. This gave me the idea of a flooding dungeon inhabited by a senile rain god who wanders the halls in a stupor. He isn't very fast or aggressive, but if you get too close to him you will suffocate (too much moisture in the air). The rain god is also the reason the whole valley is flooding.

I never got to run this module, however.

Various issues led to the collapse of my online and offline gaming groups, and for a few years I didn't play D&D at all.

That was when I came up with the idea of turning the adventure module into a novel.

Long story short - all the stuff I described above is in the novel. The novel is told from the POV of the ""adventuring party"" (mercenaries who've recently arrived in the valley) as well as from several of the local people trying to survive the flood.

In writing the novel I added some elements that would appeal to traditional fantasy fans, but there is still a lot of OSR DNA in there. For instance, you will find:

* verb-noun spellcasting
* random encounters
* a dungeon crawl
* an egalitarian band of adventurers who resolve their disputes by arguing a lot
* shenanigans involving ropes and lanterns
* weird monsters
* treasure

(There is also one scene that has a specific reference to something from the AD&D Dungeon Master's Guide... I don't know if anyone will spot it though.)

I've run a lot of other OSR systems, but never OSE. I'm using 3d6 Down the Line's house rules (https://www.3d6downtheline.com/house-rules) as a base since there's a lot of good stuff in there. However, I'm curious if there are other ones that people would recommend.

1186,132,1gjk58n,New Generation Experiences His First Character Death,"The more things change, the more they stay the same. I'm running a game in Arden Vul with a mix of older players (men in our 40s) and a few younger ones (the 16-19 year old kids of one of the players.)

The system I'm using is homebrew: a mix of the spirits of early edition AD&D2e and second edition Shadowrun would be a somewhat accurate one-line description. The rules don't really matter to the story. Heavily armored characters are able to absorb more damage than more lightly armored skirmishers.

The youngest player was one such heavy infantry fighter. In melee with a skeleton wielding a battle axe and its four skeletal hounds, he takes a heavy hit to the head and rolls very poorly so that his armor helps him not at all. He survives but is left near death.

""Should I withdrawal?"" he asks. He has the option to withdrawal without being attacked, but he needs to use his action to do it.

""Just hit the dog, you then he won't be attacking you. You can take another hit from the skeleton,"" the player using him as a shield to attack from the second rank advises.

This character is much more lightly armored, so the advice is self-serving, but by the numbers even if the younger player suffers another critical hit, he should be able to soak it down to where he would survive with quick medical attention.

The kids seems unsure, but decides to stay in the fight and does destroy one of the last skeletal hounds.

The skeleton rolls another critical hit, and again the player rolls extremely poorly. Statistically, to roll so poorly was a 1% chance, but that was salt in the wound. The chance to survive the hit would have been only around 6%.

""Fun game, real fun game,"" he pouts and pulls out his phone by reflex.

I was worried at this point, kids these days and all that, but honestly that was often the reaction when I was a kid and a character died. I waited to see how he handled it. After another minute of combat, he was drawn back into the conversation as the players finished off the skeleton and then began to part out the dead character's equipment.

By the end of the session, he had a lot of questions about what types of wizards existed in the world, and he is now excited to play a character with magic.

The kid learned that the world is deadly and that he shouldn't take advice from the player using him as a literal meat shield.

Even the characters apparently learned a life lesson from the encounter. They returned to town and with one less character to divide the gold, each earned more individual XP than they would have otherwise.",osr,1730741882.0,1,2565,470

This would be sponsored by the library, advertised by the library, and open to the public.  So I would expect some normies and first time players here.  But I'm not crazy about running 5e.  I don't hate 5e, but the library would give me limited time to run a game (2 hours, once a week) so I would like to have a fun D&D experience, but with a rules set that plays light and fast, to maximize those 2 hours without wasting time getting bogged down in the rules.

But I also don't want to bait & switch anyone.  If I advertise this to the public as playing D&D, I'm not sure how actually playing something other than D&D would go over. 

I suppose I could advertise this as some kind of retro gaming night, and run D&D B/X, but I'm not sure how well that would be received.

1194,140,1gowm7t,One of my players just...doesn't get it ,"Making one of those ""player doesn't really understand/embrace OSR"" posts because I'm not really sure how else I might be able meet this player where they're at. 

A bit of context: I'm the DM of a four-player group online. We started by playing 5e together, and there is one player who will run a Call of Cthulu scenario for us when I'm feeling too busy or burnt out to run the game. I started exploring non-5e systems a couple years ago and after the OGL fiasco I was able to convince this group to try something else as our mainline game. We started with *Shadow of the Demon Lord* last year because it was easy to pick up and we liked the grimy vibes, but I found it wasn't sandbox-y enough. 

This year, we've been running a Black Sword Hack game that I have hitched a bunch of procedures from Errant and Knave onto to make it a little more crunchy (including spending gold for XP instead of the milestone advancement in BSH). I did my very best to set expectations for how this would differ from 5e - we had a session zero, set some ground rules, I wrote up a reference document that had some basic mechanical information and a lot of guidance on OSR gaming philosophy. Three of the players love it. They like the flexibility of a classless system and have really taken to using their equipment, the environment, and their own wits in really creative ways, and are very motivated to set their own goals and interact with the world. 

My last player is totally checked out. This surprised me because in our 5e games he was very creative when dealing with combat encounters, and absolutely loves hoarding gold so I thought more tactical infinity and a more greed-motivated playstyle would click for him. We're good friends outside of the game and while hanging out, he's expressed that he doesn't know what his 'role' in the Party is without class-specific abilities, and that he prefers to have a narrative presented to him to follow and that he feels 'lost' when presented with a sandbox. I've acknowledged that this is definitely a different experience, and that maybe in future we can try a system that has more defined classes, but also pushed him on the question of game narrative. Out of game I've tried to gently encourage him to engage with the sandbox world and in-game, when it seems appropriate, dropped little tidbits in the form of rumours or encounters that might be threads to follow, but it doesn't seem to be catching him. When strategizing with the other players, he'll say things like ""I think this is where \[DM\] wants us to go"" or ""well clearly, this is setting up our BBEG"" and other...idk, 5e-isms that suggest to me he still thinks of the game as a story arc that I have planned out beforehand and am trying to shoehorn them into. 

Is there something else I can say or do that might help make it ""click"" in this player's head that there is no ""campaign arc"" and also that this style of play might be fun if they try to engage with it? ",osr,1731343444.0,1,2965,539
1195,141,1dz3nh2,I've played AD&D 1e since 1983 and never played it BtB.,"So,  
Days away from my 52nd birthday, I realized I've never ever played AD&D 1e as written. I played pretty much continuously into my 20's and RPG's into my 40's, but I thought I had.

After the last two months reading up on different OSR titles and settling into OSRIC because it felt so right, I really started digging deep reading back through my old 1e books and house rules to see what to bring into my OSRIC based campaign. My mind just seemed to skim over the BtB parts I really never played with, and some are also omitted by OSRIC as well.

Some of those old campaigns I DM'ed for years, some I played in for years. It wasn't until I recently stumbled upon  [Anthony Huso's blog](https://www.thebluebard.com/playables) and just how far away from BtB my friends and I really were. We didn't use weapon speed factor, psionics or D6 initiative in most cases. If we did it was heavily house ruled.

After a few days I realized why I and my friends over the years never played ""vanilla"", or BtB as kids say these days. Two things really, complicated book keeping and the math. You see, Anthony has taken this burden from his players and himself with incredible spreadsheets, deep preperation, and some mild house-ruling that make doing both *much, much* easier. It makes the issues I had just not have the impact as they did to me ""back in my day."" 

It seems, he does this for the same reason we ether didn't play with those rules or house ruled them. Nobody likes a slow ass game. With a deep understanding of the rules as written and his ability to tool the worst parts away allows his games to run much, much smoother than I could have imagened. I think for the first time in my life I finally understand most of the rules I wouldn't play with before.

That doesn't mean I'll be running my game BtB. My table is a pen and paper affair. Rules printed on paper, characters on paper, and records keeping on paper. I want to run an ""Old School"" game but I'm not as willing to adheare completely to ADDICT or play with rules that cause me to do a ton of math or heavy records keeping. I don't have the capability or capacity to do so. I also won't use spreadsheets I couldn't build or maintain myself.

Will combats be deadly? Sure. Will players have to keep track of gold and encumberance? You bet. I may use psionics thanks to Anthony's explinations and handy charts.

1196,142,1einpk3,What modern additions to old-school rules have you warmed up to?,"After more than a decade of protest, I've finally come around to accept that maybe ascending AC is the superior system. Target20 is a cool workaround for descending AC, but I think ascending AC is just more intuitive. But thanks to OSE (and also BG3) I've come around on the idea without too much pain. Just as long as we aren't getting 3e AC numbers!

1197,143,1hf68in,Afraid to Do Anything,"I joined an OSR group a couple years ago, and I've been enjoying for the most part.

One thing that has hindered my enjoyment at times is the fear of doing anything ""wrong"".

The way this group plays, if you make a wrong or ""stupid"" decision, it can easily kill you, or even TPK

For example, in one session, we were hired to do a job. We did said job, and later heard that employer was involved in some missing people. We went to the employer's house to ask some questions regarding this. Later that night, the employer sent a creature that one shot all of us to the inn we were staying at. The only reason we didn't TPK was because the DM essentially retconned us winning the fight. The DM said we should have never gone to the employer's house to ask questions. 

Things like this have resulted in me being afraid to do anything, make decisions, or take any action in games. I'm too afraid to make a ""dumb"" decision and be embarrassed and die. Is this just something that is a part of OSR style play, or is this just tough DMing? ",osr,1734307674.0,1,1033,196

1199,145,1ik33z5,Another West Marches/Open Table question: how on earth are you supposed to always get back to town?,"I'm sorry if this is a really dumb question but I don't know if I've ever seen it addressed in real detail, and I've read as many blogs and other West Marches posts as I can find without seeing a satisfactory answer.

I'm putting together an open table game and, in spite of my ADHD over-prep and perfectionism, trying to take to heart the advice that running multiple parties without having everyone get back to the central location at the end of each session *a la* West Marches is impossible.

But I can't wrap my head around how that itself is possible? It seems like a much harder requirement to consistently fulfill than just allowing different groups to wander the landscape at their own pace and dealing with plot entanglements as they pop up?

Assuming that the game world is dynamic and responds to player actions, that hexes get restocked after a while, that factions make their own moves etc; doesn't this mean that in practice the exploration radius for any given party will never extend beyond where they are able to travel in a single session?

Put differently: you can basically explore a day's travel in any given direction, but when the clock strikes midnight the adventure turns into a pumpkin and suddenly everyone has to go home?

Unless we're completely hand-waving travel back to town (no chance of random encounters etc), wouldn't getting back to the starting location occupy a larger and larger percentage of any given session as players fulfill the actual purpose of the campaign and explore more territory? What if they're in the middle of a massive combat?

I'm willing to accept that I'm overthinking this, but it also feels like I have to be missing something here because I am not an inexperienced GM and yet the logistics of not just shooting for, but *requiring* that the party return to base at the end of every session seems totally game breaking.",osr,1738955790.0,1,1882,327

* I wanted to have both lined and gridded paper available to me on a spread, so I can do mapping and notes side by side.

I haven't read an osr book yet, but I have skimmed through some quick starts and Kickstart demos. 

When I sit down to *read* them, I just feel lost. 

Here's what I have, please correct me if I'm wrong:

You're usually rolling a d20+mod, aiming higher than a target number. Characters have basically no HP, and are created by rolling on a table. The author's aren't going to make a rule for every situation, the GM is going to make rulings instead. 

Gameplay should be fast. We're not spending time looking up rules. We're going to adjudicate and move on to the storytelling. Kick in the door. Kill the monsters. Loot. Repeat.

Updated understanding: You're not special, you're Indiana Jones instead of Jason Borne (which is not to mention Captain America, who is comparatively off the charts). So this isn't ""heroic fantasy"" as much as it's ""exploring dangerous spaces fantasy."" And at the end of the day, Indy still has a mortgage, so he finds ancient dungeons, sneaks his way through, grabs stuff, says ""this belongs in a museum"" and then sells it to the museum.

We're running it Swords and Wizardry style, and my players, being canny dudes, quickly realized the utility of hiring henchmen after losing a couple of retainers to animated ovens and beheading traps.

On their latest return to town, they splurged and hired everybody. I'd had fun generating mini profiles and portraits for all potential hires, and the players spent a fraction of their latest haul hiring the max number of henchmen their charisma allowed.

So now they're returning to Castle Xyntillan with about 13 hirelings, whom they've outfitted with all the best armor and gear they could buy.

Which is at once hilarious and feels incredibly unwieldy. This has become a completely different game, with a dozen light and heavy footmen preceding the players into every room.

1212,159,1ebfnry,Experimenting with loops (an exercise in dungeon building),"Having read and admired the dungeons in [Many Gates of the Gann](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/105975/Many-Gates-of-the-Gann) and [The Forgotten Grottoes of the Sea Lords](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/274219/advanced-adventures-41-the-forgotten-grottoes-of-the-sea-lords), I thought it might be interesting to break down how Guy Fullerton and Keith Sloan went about designing their dungeons. So I reverse engineered their layouts in Photoshop, trying to drill down to the essential basics, then built my own version in Dungeon Scrawl, step by step.

I had fun putting this together, and even though the end result isn't anything special, I thought I'd share here with the community. Also, the map only takes you so far - it's the encounters that really make a dungeon special, but here I'm just focusing on the layout. If this all reads as incredibly obvious stuff, my apologies!

They both focus on loops. Jacquaysing seems to be the standard approach these days, as it allows parties to circle around enemies, find alternative routes through dungeons, and have bad guys ambush the heroes in turn.  So, I drew a bunch of loops.

https://preview.redd.it/34ixrqegpjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c01ad4ee2264fd376dbefe193ac3de2c087d7a

Where there are a lot of intersections, you can drop in some large hallways and rooms, important locations that might act as centers of gravity for the dungeon, or, conversely, small rooms that might act as little more than glorified crossroads are places to station guards.

https://preview.redd.it/t6m87rnspjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c7a59308e1e53ff9f6e07833cf80ab0ef74ed5

Once you've got your loops in, you just start adding a bunch of rooms to the curves. These can be tiny clusters that will act as warrens/centers of operation for the denizens, or just random rooms that go nowhere. Even if you have a sequence of three connect rooms, these don't loop, so are in effect a dead end [(see Melan's dungeon mapping technique](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/45711/roleplaying-games/xandering-the-dungeon-addendum-how-to-use-a-melan-diagram)). Obviously you vary the size, the shape, and try to keep things interesting. I added some natural caverns to the very south, with vague ideas of this being a no-man's land that's kept gated off the main complex.

https://preview.redd.it/vo0g72rxpjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=b30a82004bd59fcf8c2a3d8bf7df97137aacb51b

The next step is to straighten the hallways so that the looping isn't terribly obvious. Add walls to some of the large chambers so that not everything is isolated down its own hallway. I used the 'rough' feature on Dungeon Scrawl to make the caverns look more organic and interesting.

https://preview.redd.it/fiuy64w8qjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=a319eab9fe5fa07fd12631d47030ef27e353a4d8

At this point, it helps to scrutinize the map and wonder where the spheres of influence might be. You generally want a couple of major factions on any given floor for a map this size, and then two or three smaller operators that the party can interact with. I decided the very bottom right and top left would work, as they'd leave lots of empty space between them, as well as having the most complex looking layout for organizations to utilize. More on that later.

Next was adding doors, statues, pools of water, prison cells, one way doors, daises and thrones, all the good stuff that makes a dungeon interesting and provides fodder when it comes to actually creating the encounters that brings a dungeon to life.

https://preview.redd.it/yfj4u9ynqjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e60c8724ac24e3530bd7ae822261317bc928212a

Not only that, but you want several ways into the dungeon, and several ways to the next floor below. I made sure there were a handful of each. Red indicates ways in from the surface, green indicates ways down to the second floor.

https://preview.redd.it/8vot6tr3rjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=c668bda696fbba431cde7cf9cc4e456831d27529

So a couple of main staircases lead down into the complex, neither too close to each other but within spitting distance of the large throne room. However, I also added a secret tunnel coming into the cave complex. I could probably have added another way in, a chute somewhere perhaps from a surface ruin, but that's fine for now. Then, heading down, you have an official staircase off the throne room, the spiral staircase in the upper west, and the grand pit in the hexagonal room. You also have a secret chute in a prison cell, as well as a 'lost' spiral staircase in a caved off room. Lots of ways to navigate both up and down. Still, might benefit from even a few more.

Finally, I colored in the spheres of influence. Green in the bottom right, being so close to the throne room, is probably the 'official' inhabitants of the complex, while red in the upper left are a rival faction. Yellow and purple are independent operators (lost adventurers, rogue mercenaries, an independent sage, whatever.). And the dark blue would be environmental hazards, ranging from interactive statues to traps. All this of course would be finessed when you actually write the keyed encounters. Here, it just gives you a sense of what might work, and whether you need to add a couple random more rooms or whatever.

https://preview.redd.it/7w4ck2girjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ac5d458b916005c557f32ab2910fdb4ca1c72f

The remaining rooms are empty. This allows the dungeon to breathe, gives room for wandering monster encounters, and can feature clues, loot, or means to convey history about the complex. I could see adding one more independent operators, maybe a few more traps or the like, but for the most part, you want a good chunk of the dungeon to be dark and still.

And there you have it. A dungeon with loops. My final result is nothing special, but it allowed me to explore some of the design practices that I think Guy Fullerton and Keith Sloan used for their wonderful modules.

Add in new monsters, interesting loot, small hidden mysteries, opportunities for straight combat, a few strange and powerful dungeon denizens, chances to bargain and make allies, complex set pieces (the throne room, the massive statue chamber, the caverns), lots of ways to travel between levels, environmental hazards, and puzzles, and you're well on your way to an enjoyable dungeon.

(Caveat: this was just generated out of nothing, with no story behind it. If you're creating a dungeon for a campaign, obviously the context would inform the design, whether it be a wizard's abandoned complex, a complex series of sea caves, or whatever. You'd also have to think first about the factions, make sure they have access to exits, and all that. This was a simple exercise, so please excuse any obvious shortcomings!)

I hope you guys enjoyed this. Again, I know it's no great shakes, but I find exploring the theories behind dungeons to be really interesting, and thought I'd share. Cheers!",osr,1721862902.0,1,7037,1038
1213,160,1dz1zln,“Less simple” osr games ,"I have been playing RPGs since I was a kid in the 80’s. In general a lot of the osr stuff that I have checked out is pretty sweet. OSE advanced is probably my favorite systems wise. One thing that I don’t love is the trend towards “simple” games. While I am not saying that is horrible, my preference tends to the complexity level of 1st / 2nd edition (more on the side of first) ad&d. What are some good osr games that aren’t necessarily overly complicated but that don’t use simplicity as a selling point?",osr,1720530524.0,1,507,96
1214,161,1dboeef,Letting Go or How I Learned to Truly Love The Sandbox,"I thought I’d share this after a series of good experiences running a game recently. I felt that it something that GMs/DMs run into occasionally or perhaps it could be a learning experience as it was with me.

So I’ve been playing tabletop roleplaying games for around 17 years. But I didn’t cut my teeth on traditional starting games, like Dungeons and Dragons. In fact, my first game was the Chronicles of Darkness (I believe that’s the name of the series, I always just called it World of Darkness). More specifically Changeling: The Lost. It was a nice, straightforward system, but one that emphasised these deep, interpersonal narratives, and had this detailed and interesting lore. It was more about telling a story, rather than playing a game. It had a profound impact on me and how I run my games from then on…And part of the problems I’d come up against later.  

Over the years, I have run years long campaigns to one-shots, covering a range of systems. I’ve mostly ended up running science fiction games, with the occasional foray into horror or fantasy. I’ve ran things as rules-light, with a focus on story first, rules second. I sort of run a sandbox at the start of games, but they always end up drifting into this grand narrative that they players want to pursue. Chapter one is always a ‘Fuck around and find out’, and when players become a little more aware, when they’re presented with several hooks, when they’re settled into their characters, it tends to change into the narrative-led campaigns I’d like to think I’ve done an alright job over the years, gaining experience with each session ran, though I would not call myself an expert.

A few years ago, I was recommended Stars Without Number by a friend. My gaming group was finishing up a fantastic campaign (I was the player this time) and were looking to the future. I volunteered to run a science fiction game but I was about to go with my choice game of Mongoose Traveller. However, Stars Without Numbers seemed good. It was straightforward to learn for both GM and players, had a plethora of tools to use and I could create my own setting.

The campaign was great! I thoroughly enjoyed it and I believed (or hoped) the group did too. There was mixture of laughter, joy, sadness, horror, anger, confusion and all the great elements of a game. In fact, it got me hooked onto the whole OSR movement. (I know there is a disagreement about what truly is OSR, but I believe Kevin Crawford’s games are OSR…Or at the very least, that gateway drug into it). However, there was one thing I struggled with. Burn out. The ending of the campaign could have been better. I’ve reflected on this for a while, and I think it was apparent to both myself and my players. I was tired…And I wanted to finish something that I had planned to go on for a little bit longer. My ending I originally planned was blown out the water and significantly improved by what the players did, and done in such a way that would allow us to return to the setting in future.

But why was I tired? Simply put, I was too focused on making everything bespoke. Maybe out of stubbornness, or maybe out of the compulsive need to be making a campaign my own, I ignored the fantastic toolkit provided by Kevin, or the tools provided by others in the community. I created a sandbox, the players latched onto a hook and I needed to carefully and cautiously create every intricate detail. NPCs, religions, worlds, government systems, quests, encounters, food, cultures, names. Nothing must be left to chance and I must handcraft everything. The players make their decisions and I get to work. Sometimes it takes an few hours to prepare…Sometimes longer…When it is created, and I present it. Sweat falls from the brow, my eyes well up at the hard work. I’ve done it. I’ve done it.

…Only for the players to ignore most of it…

I laugh now and I recount a particular experience when I created an Alien-themed dungeon exploration. It took weeks for me to create this bespoke planet, dungeon, alien, clues, lore…Only for the players to by-pass it a good chunk of it. We had fun, there was tension, there was cheers when the alien creatures were defeated, and there were gasps when the alien abilities were discovered…But the experience broke me and it was at this point, I started to really feel the burn-out.

Now, allow me to diverge slightly on different (but relevant) tangent. A few years ago, I used to work as a teacher. People in the UK (but I suppose the same could be said elsewhere) know that teaching is a tricky job, with uncompetitive pay, ever-increasing high workloads, ever-present burn-out. I was entering a school as an NQT, being the only person who taught my particular subject. It very hard, but rewarding. But in that first year, I made all these resources, activities, plans. Everything must be organised for the enjoyment of the class, if I don’t have absolute control over this, they won’t learn or enjoy…Doesn’t this sound familiar? After my first year, I began to take stock and one of the best pieces of advice I was given was…Work smarter, not harder…Sounds easy right? But this was revolutionary to me at that time. So I began to get into my own, looking through what in the past year worked, what didn’t, and how I could streamline it as much as I could. I managed to get into my own groove as a ‘chalk and talk’, old-school (pardon the pun) teacher. The lessons with the less prep and easier activities, ended up being the most fun for us all. Why? Because I wasn’t killing myself with overwork and the kids knew that. If did this with my teaching job, why the hell wasn’t I doing it with running campaigns!?

So after that campaign, I just became a player for a while. Getting immersed into the world of the OSR, learning how other GMs run their games and taking inspiration from low/no prep. A few months ago, some friends outside of TTRPG gaming were going through a tough time. I suggested that we all meet up regularly to play games online. We started to do this, and we wanted to make it a bit more of a permanent fixture. Going off the recent success of Baldur’s Gate III, I suggested we play a TTRPG. Some of the group had a little experience with one-shots I ran in the past (and had fun!), some had no experience. So I decided I would run a Worlds Without Number game…I would run a fantasy game (outside of my typical sci-fi comfort zone) and I would run it milking absolutely every tool I could. I would be the laziest GM there was. Everything was to be completely randomised. Names, quests, locations, hooks, encounters, enemies, traps. I would merely act as a glue to fit it all together…Or to ditch it if needs be. I created a basic world, history, calendar and religion. These could fit on a small document and be vague enough for players to explore as they see fit. I created a starting encounter (prison break, a nice Elder Scrolls feel to it) and after that, the group took over. A few landmarks, cities and villages were scattered around. No work was done to them unless the players stated they would go there. So far, blood cults have been infiltrated, dungeons delved, they have been exiled from villages and they’re currently in the middle of taking down a gang. All created by what they wanted, and what was rolled. The most I have prepped for a game was 6 hours, before we even started (this was the world-building creation stated before). Since then, I have been 45 minutes to 1 hour prepping. I have never prepped for more than 1 session ahead. Maybe a little more prep with dungeon delving, as I’m getting used to making dungeons on DungeonCraft and using tools on Roll20, but prep is taking nowhere near as long as it once did. I’ve been running this for several months and it’s going great. I started to let go…

What has trigged this self-reflection? My players are saying how much they are enjoying it. They’re creating resources, lore, and memes. In fact, they are enjoying it as much as if I’d made everything by hand and had control in absolutely everything. The only difference is that I’m not breaking my back to see it happen. It’s been such an enlightening experience running a game this way. I know that there may have been other factors in all this and that our collective enjoyment can’t just be down to a single lightbulb moment, but I feel it’s worth sharing.

We live in world where there is an expectation that GMs have to reinvent the wheel and create everything by hand and establish these grand narratives, whilst also dealing with the insane workloads that come from that. People talk about a GM shortage sometimes, and I feel that this mindset, does have some bearing on the issue. I know many people might say that ‘online person doesn’t use the tools properly. Doesn’t have fun. Eventually uses tools. Has fun’ but I think there is a huge mindset shift that goes with this.

Similarly, there’s probably people reading this saying ‘Woah, get a load of this guy making the absolute worst choices when running a game’ and ‘I’ve always run games in this way, this isn’t revolutionary’. Well to me, it was. Moreover, I think there is an immense pressure out there to create and plan way too much. Sometimes learning is about making the mistakes and building from that.

So, work smart and not hard GMs out there. Avoid what I did…Or, actually, do what I did. Learn what you can do, self-reflect, make those mistakes, and learn to avoid in future.",osr,1717919187.0,1,9452,1690

I keep telling him there will eventually be a payoff, but we've gone through 1 large dungeon and 3 small ones at this point.

""I'm a magic-user, so I can't do anything this round.""

""I would use a spell here, but I don't know any, and we should save it for Sleep anyway.""

""I'm not even going to throw a rock because I have like a -4 to hit.""

""Being a magic-user is objectively worse than being a wizard in modern systems. There's no cantrips, but it's still somewhat satisfying to sleep a horde of enemies. It just rarely happens.""

And so on. I should mention, he does like the OSR playstyle, completely gets it, and he knows he has to think creatively. But I think he sometimes just wants to blast monsters, ya know? And sitting there watching the fighter run up and 1v1 tough foes while the cleric incinerates a horde of skeletons with turn undead... Yeah, I can kinda see why.

And to address some of his problems, he *has* found plenty of spells to learn, but most are situational, and he's always under the assumption Sleep is better so he's afraid to use up any slots. 

He is a Breggle, and can use his horns to attack which are better than any weapon he can use, but he is playing it smart and safe and does not get into any melee combat.

Basically I am looking for suggestions on how to handle this perceived imbalance (I am aware this is the nature of being a MU). But at the same time, I just want him to have more fun. 

Should I let him learn a cantrip? Give him magic rod which can cast a cantrip? How would I even go about designing a basic cantrip? Save vs. Spells or take 1d4 damage?

**WHAT IS MOTHERSHIP MONTH?**

Simply, a bunch of 1st and 3rd party designers are crowdfunding \~20 *SICK* Mothership books and zines on Backerkit in a community-oriented, group event.

The theme is CRIME!

It's like Zine Quest, but specifically for Mothership, and with some cherries on top.


**WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?**

Mothership is damn good. And these projects look incredible (more on those later). But aside from that:

The community-building that Tuesday Knight Games and 3rd party designers have been doing in the Mothership scene is incredible and I think it's important to support that. This event, via both TKG's and community support, gets art made and indie designers' rent paid.

Other designers take notice, this cross-collaborative model 100% translates to other games and communities.


***Disclaimer:*** *I'm not crowdfunding anything for Mothership Month, but I have worked with a few of these rad designers. While some of them are my friends, and I am contributing a small scenario as a stretch goal in the event, I'm writing this as a fan of Mothership first.*

*For context: I'm Ian Yusem, I published Hull Breach Vol. 1 and many other Mothership scenarios.*


# THE MODULES

If Mothership is known for anything, it is/should be its incredible modules—both 1st and 3rd party. This month's offerings are no exception.

Notably, there are some very cool bonus rewards if you back 5 or more projects (NPC card packs, etc.), so it's worth stretching to support extra projects if you only planned to back a few. They're calling it the *""Supply Drop""* if you're looking for details.

The following are few projects that I think look particularly dope, but I encourage you to poke through the whole roster yourself ([another link for you](https://www.backerkit.com/c/collections/mothership-month)).


[**WAGES OF SIN**](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/tuesday-knight-games/mothership-wages-of-sin)

This is the biggie. 1st party bounty-hunting hardcover written by Luke Gearing. If you didn't know, Luke is possibly the best module designer and among the best writers in TTRPGs (in my opinion, anyway).

It's a no-brainer. If you play Mothership, you're getting this.


[**PK49**](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/lone-archivist/pk49-a-psychokinetic-adventure-for-mothership)

This one reminds me strongly of Judge Dredd, particularly the 2012 movie: a dungeon crawl through gang-run apartment blocks (but in space and even more psychedelic). The graphic design is sure to be killer with Mothership veteran Lone Archivist (Primeval, etc.) at the helm.

1230,177,1gj3liv,Realized I’m a pretty bad GM,"So quite a negative and rambly post but I wanted to share to see if any others have had similar feelings or if anyone could offer some much appreciated advice. 

I ran a session today and it really solidified in my mind that I’m not that great of a GM. I’ve been running games on and off for a couple of years now and I feel like a always find myself getting overly argumentative or agitated with my players, harming the atmosphere of the session.
I feel more like a ‘police of fun’ rather than a referee or someone who encourages creativite and fun play. 

My players often get distracted which I expect a little but often find quite disheartening. Can feel like some of the players do not care much for the game, I know this is mostly untrue but it can definitely feel this way sometimes.
I think that I might not be prepping fun enough adventures but I’m not entirely sure.

Anyways, I don’t expect to be an incredible GM but I think I’m missing something and I’m unsure of what that ‘something’ is.

I’ve posted this in this subreddit because my GMing style is mostly OSR inspired along with the game system we use also being heavily OSR inspired (a system I am currently developing).

Any observations or advice is greatly appreciated and if anyone has any questions please ask away.

EDIT: 
Thanks for all the helpful responses and possible solutions, its so nice to see that so many people in this community care about my random problem. I've sent a message to my players and they seem to be up for trying to focus more on the game, which I think will help me run the game overall.

I think I'm going to try and be more open with my players about how I feel in the moment and be more open to wacky solutions they might try and how being a fan of my plaerys can help me enjoy the game more. I think honesty about them being distracted and game expectations will go a long way since I've been friends with some of my group's members for my whole life.

Going forward I feel that I need to know my weaknesses, like being easily irritated, and just try to remember its a game and I should be trying to have fun as well as the players. I've also noticed that I can have quite a rude attitude to some players when they annoy me, which doesn't help anyone.

Once again, thank you for the help and I will definitely be reading some of the suggested GM advice material.",osr,1730685808.0,1,2367,445

1232,179,1f1hppl,Everyone's impressions of Cairn 2e?,"So, if you don't know, PDFs for Cairn 2e were already sent out for backers on Kickstarter like a month ago. But it seems like practically no one discusses it. People are just waiting for the full boxed set release in the next year? Or it just seems like there isn't much to discuss? 

Just to compare with something like Knave 2e, there was and still is a lot of discussion. And yes, much of it is pretty negative, but still, a discussion is a discussion. Like, again, it seems like people are pretty silent about Cairn 2e ""digital release"", like nothing happened.

For me, I really like what I saw in Warden's Guide, especially the bestiary with some great art and the big section about foreground advancement, without boring ""you earned 2000 xp, so now you can have +1 to your attack damage"" stuff, all of the advancement is in the fiction. Lack of progression is something I see often mentioned, where talking about using Cairn for a longer campaign, so it's nice to see it addressed. 

What are your opinions about Cairn 2e? Whether it's about the rules (but those aren't really different from 1e, so maybe there isn't much to discuss), backgrounds and Vald setting, Warden's Guide and its advice or about released adventures?

1233,180,1hiwm7y,Why Mystara?,"Hi!

I was born a few years after the waning years of both ADND 1e and the whole BECMI line. I'm now taking more interest in everything Basic, Expert and the Cyclopedia.

One thing from that period that is still very obscure to me is Mystara. I have at least a vague idea what almost every other D&D setting is about, or what sets them apart from others.

But Mystara is an absolute question mark for me. I know that some of the B/X adventures are suggested to be from it, and I know there's a long series of Gazetteers (I even own the first one!).

Yet, I keep seeing love letters to Mystara. It could just be that it was well written, or had some interesting ideas, or nostalgy. But I wonder if some fans of it could try and sum up for me what it has to offer. Why should I take interest in Mystara over any of the other settings?",osr,1734736921.0,1,832,163
1234,181,1gkg8vo,Do you prefer race-as-class or race + class? Why?,"I normally prefer having both race and class as it feels more natural; having a race also be a class feels one-dimensional if EVERY elf can fight and cast spells, every dwarf is basically a fighter, and so on.  It's a big reason I was NOT a fan of the Basic D&D style as opposed to Advanced D&D, along with not liking the sandbox and hexcrawl approaches so common in the OSR.



However, the more I think about it, the more it also makes demi-humans feel alien and, well, not human. They feel completely unique and it makes the world feel different, rather than elves/dwarfs/etc feeling like humans with extras. For example, I feel like in a setting where elves are both a race and a class it feels more ""foreign"" to have an elf kingdom that's like Lothlorien rather than an elf kingdom that's like a human kingdom but with elves, with various classes like humans.

1235,182,1h6os1e,Trolls in the Trees: We need more lost troll civilizations in D&D,"Everyone knows trolls regenerate. What they don't know is that this also makes them practically immortal. This isn't because their souls are embodied, like Tolkein's elves. It's because trolls' regeneration was the product of an advanced civilization of magical bioengineers. Specifically, their own.

The key to their regeneration is a rare turtle that lives in certain swamps. The ancient trolls did something to the turtle and to themselves that gave them the ability to regenerate provided they consumed the flesh of the turtle every ten years or so. Modern trolls remain in the swamps, tending to their turtles and guarding the sources of their immortality with their lives. But they aren't so diligent about guarding the secrets of their creation because they don't remember them.

You see, troll regeneration isn't a perfect process. Over time, their skin and hair starts to acquire the texture and hue of their marshy habitat. Their postures becomes more hunched, while the process overcompensates with their nails and teeth, turning them into fangs and claws. But the biggest, most deleterious, change is to their intellect. The troll mind, perhaps much like a human brain, is not very good at storing several lifetimes worth of memories and knowledge and their regeneration does not do nearly enough to restore the functioning of their brains. The only reason trolls have even an average of ""low intelligence (5-7)"" after centuries of decline is because they fell from the dizzying heights of super genius intellect. 

So the next time your adventurers are exploring the ruins of a lost civilization and are staring at the large statues of their human-like rulers, they should perhaps consider that the size of the statues may not be artistic license, but accurate representation. Look a little closer at their handsome regal faces and they might notice the nose is a little too long and pointy. ",osr,1733340509.0,1,1906,310

1239,186,1j2mfa2,"D&D 5e player, interested in Old School Essentials.  Looking for experiences.","Hi everyone,

I've played D&D since 4e, but I've always gravitated to using running games with less emphasis on rules and limiting longer combat sessions.  I didn't really understand the history of D&D and that there was a basic / extended version of D&D that was separate from AD&D.

That leads me to my post.  I'm interested in how OSE (B/X) differs from 5e (at a high level).  Are there folks here that have experience with both (I'd imagine the answer is yes)?  What are the strengths / weaknesses of both systems.  Are there any serious limitations with OSE (B/X) that people have run into?  Do players sometimes complain?

I'm hopeful that OSE would be a good fit for our gaming group.

Thanks for any advice!

1240,187,1elg7ql,Tendency towards complexity in RPG's,"I was reading an excellent series of posts about *Traveller* {[Classic Traveller: Out of the Box!](https://talestoastound.wordpress.com/traveller-out-of-the-box/)), and the author emphasizes how indebted to the original *Traveller* LBB's were to D&D's original White Box. And that much how like D&D was originally a generic tool kit for fantasy games, Traveller was intended for generic Sci-Fi.  However, even by the time of the *Traveller Book* there was already a tendency to place more and more ""world"" information into the core rules and even mechanics. Fairly soon, the ""Third Imperium"" was THE *Traveller* setting. 

Others have noted a similar progression with D&D. White Box, Basic, heck even up to AD&D it was pretty generic/make your own setting. But, as the game progressed more and more things got answered until we were looking at things like Krynn or Faerun, settings that attempt to out Tolkien Tolkien. And this happens even in games that aren't ""overly generic."" One of my favorite games ever is *Vampire,*  and yet each supplement made the game less and less interesting to me.   
  
So, circling back to Traveller and the imposition of 3I early on its development--is there a unified theory or ideas as to why? Or it it just capitalism? After the core books, the players don't **need** the publisher, but the publisher still needs to eat, so creating these worlds keeps the company afloat. Is it a demand from players/GM's? Not everyone has the time or energy to create a whole setting/world from scratch after all. Is it due to a changing  audience?  For example, the original cohort of D&D designers and players grew up reading Howard and Vance and Leiber, but the following generation was more familiar with Tolkien, and then those inspired by Tolkien, and on and on until now when the Lord of the Rings movies, Harry Potter and video games are the entry path to Fantasy. Which means that ""logic"" of old school D&D makes little if any sense, if only because the basic frames of reference are so different.

Let's say you have your megadungeon with hundreds of rooms, and the first week you have 4 players decide to explore its depths. They explore some rooms, kill some beasties, get some treasure, and at session's end return to town to rest. 

Next time, you have 3 different players come. Wouldn't this just be repeating the same thing as the earlier group with some differences? Different (perhaps wandering) encounters, the treasure in Room 4 isn't there anymore because Group A already got it, and so on? What exactly could Group B do that would make the session fun, unless you skip a bunch of the early rooms (which doesn't seem to be the idea although it's reasonable) or have tons of alternate entrances to the dungeon so Group A might have found one, Group B finds another in a different part of the dungeon (which seems nonsensical) so they're exploring a totally different area. Not to mention having to keep track of which room has/hasn't been explored (but that sounds fun)

How is this actually meant to work out? It seems like one group gets to ""actually"" play and the other groups are either going through rooms that have already been cleared out so don't have treasure anymore, maybe a handful have been repopulated or they fight wandering monsters, skipping ahead to something like ""You make your way through several rooms that have already been cleared out"" where they then get to explore further in, or something else?

Loser by Beck:

In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey (I am the forever gm) 
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie (jacked up on redbull and rdy to roll) 
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables (painted beholder miniature ready to go, terrain on the table) 
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose (adding all the fine details and npc shopkeeps, etc)

Kill the headlights and put it in neutral (lets get going, players take the wheel) 
Stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control (internally I have no idea what im doing, bout to crash and burn) 
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D (wife is in the other room, taking care of baby, pissed off its thursday game night) 
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat (backup sleep plan if I wake her up cheering/arguing)

Someone came in sayin' I'm insane to complain(player defending the decision...) 
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt(for an insane stunt to get of a bad situation alive, rule lawyering me) 
Don't believe everything that you breathe (be the impartial referee) 
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve (let the dice dole out various fates, random encounters) 
So shave your face with some mace in the dark (the sensation of improvising when players now go way of the rails) 
Savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park (pulling out all the tricks to get back on track) 
Yo, cut it (enough, enter bbeg)

Soy un perdedor (the game is going down in flames, everyone's characters are dying, freaking out) 
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? (Dont get mad at me Im doing this for free) (Double-barrel buckshot) (another player character dies) 
Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? (Cmon lets keep playing this nerd ish)

Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare (my justification for the way way too difficult dungeon in the mod) 
Ban all the music with a phony gas chamber (stop the complaining by adding secret passage/ solvable trap) 
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag (players overcomplicate the very obviously solvable puzzle) 
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag (really muddling through - just pull the lever and put the thing in the other thing)

With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job (pcs survive, run it back again, taking way too many health potion, pcs scarred deformed) 
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob (back in town, improvising npc dialogue poorly) 
He hung himself with a guitar string (players not buying it) 
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing (descriptions of the food they order in game) 
You can't write if you can't relate (players cant agree on the next course of action, took poor notes) 
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate (running through various plans, outcomes) 
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite (me, the gm, just sitting there listening to the players)

While the primer itself follows these saying with blocks of explanatory text, out in the wild they're often just dropped as ancillary shorthand. The particular argument I saw was based on reading the ""zen moments"" of the primer as a reaction to D&D3e rather than as a set of novel statements; that ""Rulings not Rules"" means a DM should be able to use rules for intuitive results rather than that detailed rules are to be avoided, and that ""forget game balance"" means players should sometimes be faced with challenges which must be worked around or avoided rather than the idea of a ""balanced encounter"" itself being anathema to the game.

We had asked a shopkeeper if we could do any favors for him in exchange for the goods we need. He informed us that a massive goose had been seen roaming the area and terrorizing people. Recently, it appeared in his bedroom, vomited toads on him, then disappeared.

So, we went to where it supposedly had been seen last. It had constructed a nest filled with stuff it had stolen (some of which couldn't have been found locally). We saw the goose placing a halberd onto the nest. Our wizard cast invisibility on me. I snuck in, grabbed the weapon it had just obtained. It slipped out of my hand. The goose freaked out and failed in my direction. Didn't hit me due to the invisibility.

I picked up the halberd and ran to where my friends were laying in wait nearby. I took off my shield and threw it at the goose (this attack ended my invisibility). The goose caught it in it's mouth and tossed it onto the nest. I waved the halberd in the air and shouted ""Honk"" repeatedly. It gave chase and fell right into our ambush. We did immense damage to it quickly. All ending with me decapitating it with the halberd.

A couple of months ago we played the hundredth session of our online open-table OSE campaign, a hex map populated with loads of modules new and old. I've been chronicling gameplay from the start on my [blog](https://therecouldhavebeensnakes.wordpress.com/keep-on-yeoldelands/) with the added personal challenge of including at least one picture to keep me drawing, and concluded most of them with some GMing reflections.

Players were also encouraged to send in their own accounts of the sessions either from their own perspective or that of their character for some bonus XP - not a huge amount, but enough to reduce the sting from treasure-less expeditions. Those had been archived on Kanka.io, but that quickly became unwieldy to reference.

So to mark the occasion, I compiled all the above into a hyperlinked PDF for a more convenient reading experience, and uploaded a book version to Amazon, wanting an accessible printed version for anyone who, like me, might prefer to reduce screen time.

Hopefully it may be of help to folks contemplating running an open-table campaign in this digital age, an encouragement to those anxious about their imperfect GMing (I make mistakes aplenty), of interest to anyone curious as to how some classic modules might play out, or of service to whoever fancies a new paperweight or doorstop.

1255,202,1cp92si,Regarding Ten-Foot Poles,"Ten-foot poles. Regularly considered to be the single most important object the galaxy ever did spawn. (Aside from perhaps towels.) And rightly so. But... how do you actually haul the blamed things about? 

A 10' pole is, after all, a whooping ten feet long. And presumably of a notable girth. Thus surely a bit heavy, too. A right bulky thing to move from A to B in the best of circumstances; I can only imagine how much more bothersome it'd be to carry in a tight, dark, dungeon, whilst being chased by some bastard of a grue. 

I myself regularly chop and haul wood, and I can assure you that even a measly six feet of the stuff is a bugger to operate with any degree of dexterity. I can't possibly imagine just strapping it to my back and strolling on unencumbered.

To say nothing of a 3' tall hobbit with a 7 in Strength trying to accomplish any of this.

So, my question is, how often do you take these inconveniences into account? Do they come up in your games? I imagine the most reasonable ruling would be to say characters need to hold the pole, and then presumably drop it in combat, depending on their weapon of choice.

There's also something to be said as to how this all relates to polearm weapons. Wouldn't they be a kill-two-birds-with-one-stick situation? But I think that's a bit of a tangent.",osr,1715401675.0,1,1313,240

I know that some systems introduce the idea that spells can only be cast through one time use magic scrolls and I'm not really a fan of that either. I've tried both of those systems and I'm looking to find something a bit different.

1258,205,1hodakt,The Hole in the Oak: 7 deaths in 7 hours (play report),"Today I ran [The Hole in the Oak](https://necroticgnome.com/products/the-hole-in-the-oak) with 4 level 1 players. In 7 hours, there were 7 deaths. Yet they weren't totally inexperienced. I'd already played them a dozen OSE sessions, with perhaps 6 deaths, but I guess they weren't ready to tackle such a dangerous dungeon.

*(Spoiler alert do not read on if you intend to play the module)*

After visiting several very quiet rooms and killing a crab spider, they met the mutant ogre. After initiating dialogue, the orgre began to get angry and threatened to devour the group's elf. When the elf tried to flee, a fight broke out, which obviously went very badly (it's a 6+1\*HD creature). Two players made the mistake of fleeing to an undiscovered location. They came face to face with the 3 troglodytes who slaughtered them. The other two lured the ogre to the teleporter, who found himself transported to the bat cave.

**2 deaths**

Later, they discovered the bronze idol. Rushing to steal the chalice, they were attacked by 7 baby trees and, instead of fleeing, tried to hold on. That was really suicidal : they killed 7 of the 24 opponents, but only one PC survived by running away.

**3 deaths**

Then they approached the beach where the ghouls are. They killed the ghoul cut in two, then fled in a boat (there are 7 other ghouls, which is *a lot* for level 1s). But one of them was paralyzed and devoured on the beach. Bad luck.

**1 death**

A little further down the river, they climbed the bridge that led them to the Wight. They stole his sword and fled, but due to a random encounter they were sandwiched by fire beetles. One of them lost his life while the others managed to escape.

**1 death**

In 7 hours, they had lost 7 characters and found the dungeon not very balanced for level 1s. I thought they were tired of dying so often, but they enjoyed the game and are keen to continue.

They had certainly been overconfident in killing the crab spider during their 1st encounter, and were relying too much on their 19\~20 AC to get through. I explained to them that they were far too quick to resort to combat and that they needed to be much more careful. For the next session, they'll go back to town to rest, equip themselves and come back with multiple retainers.

They've already explored 27 of the 60 locations, wounded the Ogre and eliminated the fauns, but only found \~1000 gp. They still have to visit the lair of the giant lizards and meet the gnomes. Then, perhaps, if they survive, they'll look for a way to get rid of the enemies they've already encountered: the 7 ghouls, the shadow, the wight and the mutant ogre. Or maybe they'll all be killed by the gnomes and their magical tree stump.

Overall, it was a good game, but perhaps a little too action-oriented. Hard to argue with an ogre or man-eating fauns. I think it was a bit frustrating for them, but players will be all the prouder ***if*** they manage to finish the dungeon next time with fewer deaths.",osr,1735414427.0,1,2987,532

1260,207,1h8u6ao,Rangers instead of Clerics,"I don't terribly like the B/X Cleric, but it does fill certain important niches in D&D (healing, WIS-based class, etc). The crazy idea I've had: replace Clerics with Rangers.

Reasons why:
-Lord of the Rings doesn't have anything resembling Clerics, but it does have Rangers who, amongst other things, heal and hunt evil (we have elves, Hobbits, etc; why not rangers?)

-Replace slightly world-breaking Vancian healing magic with herb-based limited healing from Rangers (maybe a percentile chance to cure poison and disease if the right herbs are on hand)

-Logical best armor is chainmail (and maybe not even shields?). Thus, the Fighter gets a real niche in terms of armor access

-Could be a class that naturally gravitated more towards Dexterity and archery to support the Fighter that gravitates toward Strength and melee

-Magic-Users get a real niche in being the only spellcasters

-Thief is a dungeon exploration expert; Ranger is a wilderness exploration expert (thematic counterbalance that doesn't interfere with fulfilling their roles; priests don't typically condone theft)

-Could have a role in facilitating group stealth outdoors in the same way Thieves can use Open Locks to facilitate group surprise against whatever monsters are in that room

-Could probably honestly flesh out wilderness exploration. It's a little odd how every character, regardless of class or level, has the same odds of getting lost outdoors in B/X

-Could redefine Wisdom to be more about being in-tune nature/surroundings and less about religion (maybe modifies reaction rolls with sentient, not sapient, creatures with WIS; maybe effects getting lost, etc)

-Rangers can actually shoot silver arrows, track undead across the forest, and emulate Van Helsing far more than Clerics can

-Rangers are much more archetypically neutral than mace-wielding crusader knights who specialize in repelling the undead through faith

-It is kind of silly that powerful, terrifying undead monsters run away screaming whenever the local priest pulls out his cross

The real question is which version of the Ranger across editions, retroclones, and homebrews would best fill this role. I don't know.",osr,1733583446.0,1,2177,338

Does lethality decrease as characters become more powerful, or do the threats scale in a way that keeps things just as deadly? What kind of challenges do higher-level parties typically face? Do dungeons become more about puzzles, resource management, or political maneuvering rather than just avoiding instant death?

So I've decided in the next year to house rule the fuck out of it.

I’ve been running my first OSE campaign for awhile now and sure… level 1 and 2 can be pretty sketchy, but once the players get a few levels and have a decent amount of HP alongside a collection of magic items and scrolls and potions, it’s really not that deadly.  Survivability goes way up.

So many games don’t necessarily require you to get better as a player, but rather, you get better because the game makes you better!  Gives you more powers, more health etc… in Dark Souls (like the OSR) you only get better if YOU the player gets better!

1268,215,1f2moow,My players did something crazy in Hole in the Oak (spoilers),"So they found the wizard's area where there is a scroll of diminution (which turns you into a 1 inch sized person if you read it). They were able to identify the scroll before reading it. 

They had encountered Ramius prior to this, and I played him up as a neckbeard basement dweller living with his ""concubine-wives."" They didn't like him, and managed to escape their initial encounter because they are very, very cautious. They came back later, left the scroll on his desk, and rang the bell.

Shortly after he waddles out, he reads the note and begins to shrink to a tiny person. Thanks to his now centimeters long leg span, he couldn't even cross the room before the players burst in and trapped him in a jar. He was not happy. 

They later, because they knock on doors politely, came across the mutagenic ogre (who doesn't mind adventurers, but really only hates theft), and sprung an idea. They decided to be door to door salesmen and SOLD TINY RAMIUS AS ""EXPANDING FOOD."" Much to Ramius' dismay, the ogre bought it, and ate tiny Ramius while some time later, his corpse expanded inside the ogres belly. He felt sick, and asked if they had anything the drink. 

THEY GAVE HIM THE PARALYSIS WATER. They had previously jarred some after testing out it's effects. He failed his save, and fell unconscious, and they promptly murdered him in his sleep. 

Not what I expected at all from the day's session. My mind was blown. This was the hardest they ever went into the OSR mindset. Usually, they want to fight things and feel powerful. But this time they solved the freaking dungeon like a puzzle. They left unscathed (well, one retainer was killed) and with tons of loot in tow, and plan to come back and jar some more paralysis water.

1271,218,1c89g58,Recommendations heeded,"So a few weeks ago I asked for game recommendations because D&D 5e wasn’t working for me and my family. Wife and 9yr son. 
I got a lot of excellent suggestions 31 game systems mentioned. 
I refined my ask and mentioned some feedback I got from my wife. I got another round of great feedback and advice. 

So now I got on the Mausritter train and am going to run Honey in the Rafters later today. Spent yesterday and this morning rolling up some mice and flipping through the pdf with my kid. Set the expectation of a deadly game and we rolled an extra mouse in case the worse should happen. 

I had feared that mausritter was too much of a departure from D&D and classic fantasy that it wouldn’t go over well with my kid. 

I don’t know why I worried he is all over it. As we wait for mom to get home from work he is currently outside running around with a cardboard button shield and cardboard needle sword. Then with all of his animal facts from books and kid tv shows he really latched on to predators and was suggesting good animal bad guys for the mice to fight. 

I know we haven’t played yet and character death is all well and good until it happens to a kid. But I am really amped and excited for this to work. 

Thank you the r/osr community for taking the time to share and help me out. You have aided me introducing a new generation into the hobby. 
Hopefully after a few games with mom we can open the table to some school friends and it becomes a thing. 

UPDATE 
Ran session 1. Was super late start since my youngest child wouldn’t get to sleep. So we didn’t finish and had to leave the party in the dungeon.

1276,223,1c1x2md,"My players want to start a dairy farm, help!","**Context**: On days were the group I DM for can't all make it I decided to run a small dungeon crawl campaign, using World Without Number, where there is a town and a dungeon the party had found and decided to explore. Something simple that I can just run at the drop of the hat if need be with no other development then that... what could go wrong?

Well one of my players decided to read the entire list of things they could buy and saw that you could buy a cow for 10 SP. He asked if the cow would be a dairy cow, and I said yes not really thinking much of the question. Then the party decided they wanted to spend all the silver they have on buying cows, farmland, and pay for farmers to manage the cows and becoming rich selling the milk. Keep in mind I haven't even decided what setting this mini campaign takes place in I have literally just prepared the town and a few levels of the dungeon.

A few google searches later (and a lot of of sighs and face holding by myself) I decide on that a cow can produce 20 gallons of milk a week and each gallon is worth 3 SP a gallon. This is based on some very basic numbers I saw online (knowing nothing about dairy farming myself) and figuring 1 gallon of milk being worth triple a gallon of water made sense.

**Actual Question**: Not being someone who wants to railroad my players (and while I may have played up my frustration I am actually kind of curious where this could go) I have zero idea how to turn this into a ongoing campaign. Some ideas I had were things like securing the amount of cows they would want, dealing with ""rival"" dairy farms, and figuring out where and how they are going to sell their goods. I would love some input from the community however on how I can turn this into a fun and engaging experience!

&#x200B;

**Edit:** First off thanks to everyone who took the time to reply! I'm a little blown away by all the responses and again thanks to all the kind and thought out replies. I'll address a few of the common responses. 

First, while this definitely wasn't the idea I had for a ""backup"" game, I love it when players try and make a campaign their own thing even if its not something I would have ever thought they wanted to do! While I'll definitely make some changes to the margin on the cows, you've all given me ideas on how to challenge the players in their production of milk so it isn't just a get rich quick scheme!

Second, to the people concerned about my personal enjoyment of the game thanks for your concern! If this was something I had 0 interest in running I would absolutely either just put a stop to it, or have Drag'oon, Devourer of Cows swoop in and eat up their livestock! The idea of having the players want to run a business/farm is just something I haven't really encountered before and was curious how other people ran these type of ventures. 

Lastly, I never imagined I'd know as much about cows as I do now lol so thanks again for all the info!",osr,1712886761.0,1,2955,562

What's the theory behind some of these changes?

Seems like 2e might better support longer wilderness exploration campaigns, but 1e is perfect for my mega dungeon and I will continue to use it.

I'm also curious how folks think 2e compares to other systems like Shadowdark, Cairn, B/X and Errant and how one goes about deciding which of these systems to run.

1281,228,1bk2nk8,How much is too much player prep? Help me with a perspective on what I would call osr powergaming,"I've run an OSE campaign for the last six plus months. It is a generic sandbox based on a mix of Silveraxe and Brandonsford modules.

The issue I have now is that one of my players is quite, lets say educated. We are both somewhat new in terms of understanding the how to ""play"" OSR, but we've read articles. The general consensus is that your characters should have odds in their favor. So that's what my player does.

He literally spent the first three sessions from the campaign to set up shop, so to say. Gathered *every* info about anything regarding possible adventure sites. Befriended anyone he could in town, got discounts in shops, inn. Rounded up mercs and retainers. All good, he did all of this and I let him. I mean, why shouldn't I?

The issue itself is that this is a pattern that's frankly bleeding me dry. Especially when the group dropped into a new settlement and the cycle is starting again. In my head it has become a meme, because I try to twist his hand and have the NPCs demand more, but he destroys them WITH FACTS and LOGIC and CHARM. This goes about town relationships, combat composition,  dungeon delving. He's playing a game of competency porn.

All in all my grievances are: First, it's not fun for me to just be a chatgpt bot. Second, if I don't let players get what they want, I feel weird for blocking their honest (through roleplaying and knowledge) efforts. Third, I feel dumb, outsmarted, exploited and like I'm a shit DM that can't pose a good and fair (as in not being restrictive on purpose) challenge. 

I also forgot to mention - the group overall feels content. They seem happy to play, though sometimes push for some action to happen (cue Monthy Python's ""Get on with it!""), but generally are ok with the way things are. I am too, I guess, just confused if this is the way I envisioned an ""OSE campaign"" would be like. I guess I expected more cheesy classical fantasy tropes and less macro-managing.

Any pointers here?",osr,1711013918.0,1,1964,354

* I had seen Undelved, the author of Cave of Cowardice, post works in progress pics of the project over the past few months, and I'm super excited to see that [**it is finally released**](https://undelved.itch.io/cave-of-cowardice). It's a system neutral adventure with amazing art and, perhaps more importantly, is generously hyperlinked, which makes it super easy to use in pdf form.
* [**Chrypt**](https://fedmar.itch.io/chrypt-english) is a pretty cool looking dungeon-crawling game built partially using Cairn. The pdf is designed to be easily printed in a charming A6 format, and it includes rules for procedural generation of dungeons.
* I don't see that many adventures for Dungeon Age, but the previously released [**Desert Angel Fiasco**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/322651/desert-angel-fiasco?affiliate_id=253473) is now available in print format. It's written for Cairn, 5e, and standard OSR versions, and looks like it does some interesting world-building.
* Eco Mofos, by Dave Blandy, is one of the cooler releases I saw come out in 2024, and there's been a ton of supplements released supporting it. One recent one I saw is by Roundup regular Jimmy Shelter, and is entitled [**Vehicle Rules for Eco Mofos**](https://jimmyshelter.itch.io/vehicle-rules-for-eco-mofos). Sweet, simple, and to the point.
* [**Nemesis Retribution**](https://ratwavegamehouse.itch.io/nemesis-retribution) is a slick little game that looks ideal for one shots or a session when the whole group can't make it. It's a game of enemies, dark counterparts, and all-consuming rivalries.
* I'm not familiar with Eidolon, but I just saw there is a [**2nd edition of the game**](https://reveal-your-master-plan.itch.io/eidolon2e) that was just released. It's got some neat artwork and interesting concepts that evoke Jojo's Bizarre Adventures and Persona.
* One of my personal favorite indie game designers is Tanya Floaker, and they've just released [**The Thunder Perfect Mind**](https://floaker.itch.io/the-thunder-perfect-mind), in which you play a revenant attempting to form a mystery cult with the goal of discovering what caused your untimely end and rectifying it. It's a work in progress available on itch.

* Richard Kelly has released [**Seven Strangers III**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/506097/seven-strangers-iii?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473), a class supplement for Cthork Borg. Richard always publishes some great material.
* I don't know how I missed this when it came out last week; the Welsh Piper is one of my favorite publishers, and their BX Options: Class Builder book is a classic. They've just released [**BX Options: Alternate Magicks**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/502304/bx-options-alternate-magicks?src=hottest_filtered&affiliate_id=253473), a weighty, 150 page book that introduces new spells, new spell-casting classes, a magical research system, rules for spell components, and more.
* There's only a few days left in the Kickstarter for [**Issue 41 of Populated Hexes Monthly**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thirdkingdom/populated-hexes-monthly-issue-41). This issue takes a dive into the Shadowlands, the place where souls journey after death, and explores the natives of this plane with a look at penumbrals.

1285,232,1gv6i0r,Favorite Initiative Systems ,"I have come to love side based initiative. Before using it I thought that it might get too confusing with all the players talking and trying to get their action in. But in actual play (with 4 players at least) it goes so smoothly and no one gets confused about who has done what or anything.

There are two things really pushed me over the edge to use side based initiative.

First, is that it is either the players turn, or the enemies turn. Both of which are important to the party and each individual player. There isn't really a time the players can afford to not pay attention.

Second, is that it easily allows for teamwork and coordinated/tandem tactics. If you want to lift a character up so they can climb on to a chandelier, you can both just do it when you act. No waiting around or fiddling with initiative to make it work.

One bonus reason I love it (which is the reason I considered it in the first place) is the seamless transition. One die roll and you're done, everyone knows everything they need to know about the initiative from that one roll.

All of these points come together perfectly in my opinion. I know it is nothing original or groundbreaking, but I really enjoy this initiative system and used it in my own system [Embark](https://infinite-fractal.itch.io/embark).

1286,233,1ibdoph,Tips for Mega Dungeons,"Often when running dungeons, I find that floors turn into single encounters. The party might surprise a kobold, but the one that hears the fight alerts the wizard, who rings the bell, and a defense is organized. When a dungeon floor is a single map, even if very large like 50x50 squares, it is difficult to justify ringing steel and spellfire to go unnoticed by the intelligent and sentient denziens of the level.

Outside of very specific encounters: wizard in loud lab, undead bound to a room, unintelligent blobs, bugs, and skeleton, potted carnivorous plants and so on, many intelligent enemies will organize or flee unless the party is heavily committed to stealth and casting spells like ""silence.""

I am currently running a ""mega"" dungeon, which is really a series of encounter locations on different pages, spread so far apart as to make sound passing between them impossible. A cavern. A bridge. A ruin. A warrens. A river. It makes sense, and I was lucky to find many good maps.

But I've also recently run my share of ""all the goblins group up"" scenarios because they are largely unavoidable if that is the sort of enemy present.

When your goal is to create a long lasting dungeons delve experience, how do you put your maps together when you want the experience to make sense? What are your tips and tricks? It seems like the most common ""labyrinth of rooms"" full of intelligent enemies is the least likely to work without often playing dumb.",osr,1737996581.0,1,1456,253

In addition to a fairly traditional psionics system, albeit one divorced from point-based activation, it will also include an adaptation of the classic Book of Nine Swords from late in the 3.5-era. I've always liked the concepts presented in that book, and I've reworked the rules to fit in with an OSR mindset and power scaling.

Enough about me, though. The big news from last week that I'm sure many of you have heard already is that Drivethrurpg will be raising prices on certain print on demand products, chiefly softcover books, some of which will see a price increase of up to 70%! I don't know yet how this will affect POD books from other vendors, or offset books from other sources, but it has been my experience that prices almost never *go down*. I hope that people who are in the middle of crowdfunding campaigns aren't negatively affected by the upcoming pricing increases, and for everyone else, I guess now is the time to purchase those POD titles that have been sitting in your cart.

I'm preparing to run a hexcrawl campaign this summer, and I've been reading up on the OSR philosophy. There's a lot that I like here - the emphasis on player creativity, exploration & experimentation, and prep streamlining through random tables. But what I just can't acquire a taste for is all the Gonzo stuff. I keep looking for random tables or other materials I can plunder for table content, but I keep finding stuff that feels, to me, tonally dissonant.

What I'm trying to run is something more grounded. Faction intrigue, levers being pulled. The party being manipulated by the forces that be, if they don't figure it out. I've made provisions for that high fantasy flair - the hexcrawl will be taking place in an area of intense magic that will allow weirder monsters and people out of place (or time) - but I still want it to feel grounded. I want things to have reasons to be there. I don't want a skateboarding orc to show the party how to shred, or goofy wandering merchants with robes full of dollar store gag gifts.

What sources of random tables and adventures would you recommend for someone going for a grounded, quasi-realism vibe? Any tips for running a hexcrawl?

1297,246,1bwthgy,The “Weird” part of OSR Dungeons: am I thinking too hard about this?,"I keep referring back to a Goblin Punch blog post made in 2016 titled “Dungeon Checklist” when trying to make dungeons. A part of the checklist is called, “Something to experiment with”, which the post explains it as things that are “the unexplainable, the weird, and the unknown” and makes the dungeon special by making “the thing” unique. The blog gives examples like:

- a sundial that controls the sun
- Two holes in a wall that swaps limbs
- A machine that turns products into raw goods and goods into ammunition
- A metal skeleton that can talk if a skull is placed on it

Everytime I look at this blog, I’m kind of confused. It talks about these things recontextualizes the dungeon or gives out new win conditions for combat and obstacles, but what constitutes as a “weird” thing? When I try and build dungeons with these in mind, the things I make are kind of lame, and I always think I’m missing the boat.

- A cup that stays in place if there is wine in it
- A paintbrush that can copy the color of something given a command word
- A door that doubles the weight of anything that is walked through it
- A lasso that kites clouds but it’s only 30 feet
- A ladder that if used, you grow in size (can you reverse it by climbing down?)
- A golem that works only if coins are inserted in it, but the coins it needs are all gone?

I’m definitely not asking if these are good items, because I know these aren’t. Am I thinking too hard about this? What are some better examples to help make sense of this phenomenon?

EDIT: Just wanted to say thank you all for saying your piece about this stuff! I appreciate everyone sharing insight, and while I do find it confusing, when it shows up in the right way, it’s one of the most interesting parts of the dungeon experience. Awesome stuff everyone!",osr,1712352064.0,1,1796,338

* The basic format of ""describe scenario, and then ask player 'what do you want to do?/how do you react?'"" comes from War Games, which often had referees in addition to the players.
* Early DMs debated a) whether players should roll dice, b) whether players should be allowed to speak as their character c) whether the players should even know the rules of the game when playing!

1300,42,1e1oato,I dream of playing in a sterotypical party in a classical fantasy adventure.,"Feels like every game I am in and see is so... extreme?  It's always some epic tales about fighting gods, some witcher inspired ""grey"" fantasy, genre subversions with the DM's own social comentary, dark souls type dark fantasies, etc...

The parties are always some sort of overtly wild groups people, animal people, strange magical peoples, all sorts of Human but (Animal/Elemental/Magical trait infused) that are probably born out of the game designers fetishes.

Sometimes I just wish to find a group that would like to be... simple.  
Not be afraid to be typical. Everyone always seems to try so hard to be unique with their creations, that it seems to fall into the same sort of blur it all becomes. I wanna be the shy robed mage with a large brimmed hat with a drooping point. Or the Thief in leather armour, with an attitude and a love for coin and riches who'll grow to care for the party more than the riches they seek. I can be the introspective fighter, with a large sword at his back and a dark past. Or maybe the farmer boy, with a sword, shield, and a dream. A cleric in robes, travelling in dedication to their god.

I just want to play a simple game, where no one tries to be the special unique ones.  
Where we can simply fall in the stereotype of what we are and have fun. Without thoughts of ""making a story"", and simply letting it be made, by the things we do and the rolls we make... I want to go rescue villagers taken by goblins, delve into ancient dungeons, slay the evil necromancer... Fight dragons and rescue princesses.

Is this so strange to dream about?

EDIT: Thanks you all for the suggestions! I am looking into the games suggested below, and getting familiar with the OSR stuff.

1301,43,1ey8bgr,"The new Paizo Fan Content Policy affects more than just 1e, and a highlight on the Infinite license.","EDIT: They have reinstated the CUP, thus alleviating most of my concerns below. :)

[https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6w469?Updates-on-the-Community-Use-Policy-and-Fan](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6w469?Updates-on-the-Community-Use-Policy-and-Fan)

---------------------------------------

**TL;DR:** Paizo replaced an old community use policy with no warning, which affected free tools and content, forcing them to either stop being updated, scrub all setting references and comply with ORC, or upload onto Infinite specifically, of which the Infinite license has its own concerns on exclusivity and rights to your work.

I want to talk about the new [Paizo Fan Content Policy](https://paizo.com/licenses/fancontent) (FCP), which replaces the previous [Community Use Policy](https://pathfinder.fandom.com/wiki/Pathfinder_Wiki:Community_Use_Policy) (CUP) \[Sorry it goes to Fandom, it was the only place I could find it\].

There was another thread about it regarding specifically how it affects Pathfinder 1e and Starfinder 1e content, but I feel like a lot of people brushed it off and did not see that the policy affects more than that, as well as what the Infinite license it nudges people to has.

For some personal stuff, I'm a big PF2e fan, I started learning to GM to be able to get games of it running with my friends, bought books to support it, and pushed my friends to try it out, even labeled myself a 'PF2e Fan' in a Discord for another game where people keep on complaining about PF2e constantly. This is me being concerned about these changes and want to bring more discussion about it up to see what people think when they actually look at it because some of these don't feel like just ""protecc from hasbro"". Hopefully discussions with others will put me at ease, otherwise it hopefully will put more eyes on what I think are concerns.

I am not a lawyer, I am a tired regular ol' person fan with too many thoughts whizzing through my head, so, if I have made mistakes/misunderstandings here I will try my best to correct them.

# The Community Use Policy

The very simple run down of the CUP is that it was a policy that allowed people to create stuff for Paizo products, using Paizo material, provided that they weren't charging for access to said material. Lots of folks used it, and others noted it being very easy to digest (being a policy made for fan projects) without having to worry about itty bits. Being able to use names also made it far more accessible and easy to use, as you could just look up the things you were interested in and not try to figure out naming differences ""Okay, this says ""Sun Deity"", which one was that again??"" or ""I built my character using this feat–Wait, what's the actual name for it? Uhm."" It also let people make stuff like expansions to APs, such as fleshing out characters and locations and adding additional content ideas.

* AONPRD and the Foundry VTT PF2e System were built using this license originally, and got propped up by Paizo eventually \[with the latter particularly adding an extra cash flow to Paizo with premium modules\].
* Other notable tools and resources which used the old license which are now affected are: Dyslexic Character Sheets, [pf2e.tools](http://pf2e.tools), Hephaistos and Wanderer's Guide
* This also affected fan translation site/databases (though Mark commented he would look to rectify that), fan made APs set in Golarion, possibly fan made classes/archetypes too (I'm unsure about this one), Foundry Modules that may have names or mechanic references that aren't specifically pulled from the base PF2e system (such as, say, modules to run said fan made APs or to add fan made classes/archetypes)

# We reserve the right to terminate this Policy at any time.

During the OGL debacle, and the rise of the ORC, [this blog post was made](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sid6?Update-from-Paizo-President-Jim-Butler) on 19th of July, 2023.

>""**The shift to the ORC license will also necessitate a change to our Compatibility License and Community Use Policy. We’ll have those available for public comment soon,** and final versions will be released before the new Remaster books come out in November. **We’re also taking the opportunity to introduce a new fan policy I think many artisans are going to love.**""

Bolded are that they would have to change the Community Use Policy, but will have a public comment period over it. And that there would be a new fan policy.

However, on the 22nd of July 2024, with most Paizo staff already packing up and preparing to leave the following week for GenCon, [this blog post was dropped announcing the Fan Content Policy](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6vh12). (If you want a deeper dive, I recommend also reading through the comments where there was a lot of back and forth discussions between players, creators, and Mark)

In it, people found out that this new fan policy completely replaces the Community Use Policy, effective immediately. This new policy disallows the usage of Paizo rules texts (such as monster stat blocks) and setting (such as Golarion) completely if you are using it for 'RPG Products' \[""Game modules, adventure modules, board games, video games, roleplaying simulators, character generators, rules compendiums, sourcebooks, or other such products are not permitted under this license""\].

In the comments Mark Moreland noted that those affected would have a grace period of 'try to be reasonable' to work on modifying all the names to comply with ORC, **or will be grandfathered in if they make no more changes starting now.** (Side note, those that were already on Infinite were given until September to finish anything up before the no OGL stuff kicks in, but I'm not wanting to focus on the OGL stuff here.)

The grandfathering item particularly affects resources that are hosted on websites or are modules for VTTs. All of those free tools earlier mentioned (that did not get a special contract with Paizo) now effectively have to halt all of their work, not so much as a minor bug fix can go through without them now breaking the new license that they find themselves in. Foundry Modules or other VTT modules that may have relied on the old license will potentially die without updates since it means they can't maintain themselves to new versions of the VTT.

While the CUP was not an irrevocable license and could be modified/terminated at any time (per the heading of this section), and it is obviously within Paizo's right to do what they want with their IP, it was still surprising to do so without warning with how much good will I feel Paizo had built up around it, and the earlier blog post noting that the CUP would be modified with a public comment period.

These were passion projects. ""Just change the names"" sometimes isn't as easy as it is when you didn't build ground up for it, and sometimes may diminish the point of some of these projects. And more importantly, it may just diminish the drive that the creators had to make them in the first place. It can't feel nice to have this fall on you for something you might have considered a big bright point of Paizo, where several commenters noted they loved Paizo for being so nice to make tools for. I am not sure if tools like aonprd or the Foundry VTT system would have grown to have become as big as they and thus also helped Paizo in return.

# The Infinite License

So what are your options? Either you:

* Scrub names out to comply with ORC (which may be difficult, time consuming, and/or diminishes the point of some items)
* Be big enough that Paizo negotiates a special license for you ([as is the case with Hephaistos](https://www.reddit.com/r/starfinder_rpg/comments/1ew0m92/no_hephaistos_update_today_again/), though he notes wishing this hadn't had to be done in the first place, and ponders how many other creators will get this privilege extended to them?)
* You publish on Infinite (but only if your item is for 2e).
   * Infinite isn't particularly a great place for hosting tools such as character builders. Foundry modules will be awkward (Not very user friendly, and also harder to find). Collaborative efforts like the PF1e to 2e conversions via Github will be far more awkward. Adventure Paths and new classes/class expansions would be the main thing. B**ut they cannot ever upload it elsewhere**, which would possibly even include if they wanted to make a version where they scrub all the names out to make it ORC compliant and put it on a Foundry module or other VTT.

With this, I want to highlight the Infinite agreement, [which Paizo forum user Redeux noted some key points here.](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6vh12&page=last?New-and-Revised-Licenses#mprd_post_v5748gbiwz3x9) \[Disclaimer; also not a lawyer\]

The points highlighted by them were:

* You are granting rights to your work without reversion to Paizo/Roll20. This is irrevocable, royalty-free license to develop, license, reproduce, publish, distribute, translate, display, perform your work in any language, and any future means. They can also make derivative works under full copyright ownership of your works.
* You may not publish, recreate, distribute, or sell your work on anywhere other than Infinite, Roll20, or other platforms offered by the Publisher. \[It is not in the license text which other platforms are allowed, making it uncomfortably variable\]
* If you are banned or otherwise removed from the platform, Paizo and Roll20 can still use your work and make derivatives of. They'd have to pay you for sales of your original work, but not if they make a derivative of it.

It's not just Paizo that has the rights here, but also Roll20, a different company entirely. With the new fan content policy trying to funnel people into this platform. As a layman, it's a little hmm.

While I don't believe Paizo would instantly and intentionally use this for all the worst case scenarios, but this is asking for a lot of trust, and I'm unsure that such trust should be given so easily, especially not with the recent events that lead up to this, especially not with how suddenly this is now pushed on people. Especially with a company who I feel has been given so much by their community made tools. Plus hands can change over the years, perhaps future owners might not be so nice.

I also do not believe this is anywhere as big as what WoTC did, so please don't fight over comparing that. :(

1304,46,1d5viu3,"Light-weight low magic fantasy system, with social support?","Recently I've started to crave a very specific kind of system, but nothing I've looked at quite scratches the itch. It's possible that I just haven't looked closely enough at the games I examined, or what I want is too specific in vibe, but I figured this was the place to ask.

Here's my wishlist for the type of game I'm looking for:

- Low fantasy setting. I'm not opposed to players having access to magic, but it should peak at fireball casting level at most. Maybe sword and sorcery? 
- Something that supports longer campaigns. I'd like something that my players and I can keep coming back to and get invested in
- Something that supports a more open world theoretically, i.e. isn't confined to a specific place.
- Lightweight combat. Something that runs very easily theatre of the mind, and preferably where combat isn't the default solution (but is viable).
- Better support for social encounters than ""I roll a single die and get everything I want"". Burning Wheel's Duel of Wits is maybe a bit overboard though.

So far everything I've looked at doesn't feel quite right. Knave would be a good candidate, but from what I could tell it's mainly dungeon crawling. 

Sword of the Serpentine also sounds promising from what people have said, but I'm slightly worried it's **too** investigation focused, and by default confined to a city.

Some sort of FitD system could probably be appropriate, but I often feel like the rules propel you forward more than I'd like in this particular instance. I'd want to turn to the rules to resolve ambiguity, then return to letting players do what they want. In other words, a game where the rules get out of the way when not needed.

To know if my RPG tastes align with yours, check my past games* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1bm9uk3/roses_thorns_from_every_ttrpg_ive_ever_played/)*. For the TLDR, skip down to ""Perspective after playing.""*

[Quinns' review](https://youtu.be/c29Ecut4K_E) of The Wildsea really excited me, so I got it to the table for an 8-session campaign that ended early after we all agreed it wasn't our jam. Here are my thoughts.

# Perspective before playing

These are the reasons I was excited:

* The **worldbuilding**, presentation, layout, and art. It's a gorgeous ~~book~~ PDF. I love worldbuilding, so seeing someone succeed at productizing their imagination so well was inspiring.
* The **roving**. I usually run campaigns with major story threads, and was excited for something more freeform. Not quite a hexcrawl, but I intended to let players steer the story and use journeys to generate points of interest as we went.
* The **languages**. I cannot overstate how much I love the way languages are used. Each has 3 tiers of proficiency and doubles as a knowledge skill related to its primary culture's domain. This feels so much cooler than ""I leveled up so now I speak perfect Elven, but we'll all use Common anyways.""

# Experience during play

We made it 8 sessions using the core rulebook, including 2 sessions spent playing through the official one-shot [One-Armed Scissor](https://felixisaacs.itch.io/the-wildsea-one-armed-scissor). My players went full Monster Hunter; everything was focused on taking quests to identify, track down, and kill notable monsters. We did feedback after every session. About halfway through, we agreed that the system wasn't feeling great, but opted to give it some more time. Also halfway through, I stopped prepping new material and went ""full improv,"" meaning the last 2 monster hunts (one small, one huge) were done with about 5 minutes of total prep.

**Unsetting questions were a bust... until they were our MVP**. We did these ""Tell me something that is false"" questions right away, and the group had no idea what to make of them. This was amplified by knowing very little about the world. As we revisited them, we made one crucial clarification: ""Tell me something that *might be* false."" Then it clicked. PCs would invent rumors they'd heard, I'd use the rumors but edit as necessary. By the end, these were our favorite part of the whole system.

**Character creation is easy, but contains a trap**. My players used the quick start rules and stitched characters together with equal contributions from their origin, bloodline, and post... but doing so created ""old dog"" characters who are powerful veterans with lots of abilities and good stats. Making ""young gun"" characters looked like more work to the players, so they assumed ""combine 3"" was the intended way to play. I should have argued harder, but didn't. It only took a few sessions for everyone to experience retroactive regret.

**Journeys did not work**. I'll try to summarize. Getting from A to B on your cool chainsaw ship involves assigning players to various roles (steering, lookout, engine) and making progress towards your destination. Except... player choices don't change much. The lookout is rolling to determine what you randomly bump into, but since they can't control it, the GM may as well roll. Most encounters will be cool distractions... but my PCs always set out on journeys with a goal of *getting somewhere*, so they ignored distractions. The best thing I can say is that by the ""combine a whisper and chart to generate a landmark"" was okay; by the end of our game, we reduced all journeys to a single whisper + chart, narrated a wacky resource-gathering scene, and moved on.

**The world is awesome -- and hard to expand**. I cannot overstate my admiration for the game's world. It's distinctive, cohesive, and vast (200+ pages). All of those strengths became weaknesses for us. We struggled to come up with ideas that were ""as cool"" as the published material. We also struggled to internalize the huge amount of existing lore, especially since I tried to shield players from a lot of the book (threats, reaches) to allow them a sense of discovery. As a result, our journey through this setting felt surprisingly uninteresting.

**There are too many rules**. I have a similar complaint with [Blades in the Dark](https://evilhat.com/product/blades-in-the-dark/), which I feel is a lightweight system trying to support slightly too much board game baggage. This system felt like it said ""Hold my beer."" There are 18 skills, all with very wide interpretations of use. You have a ton of different roll types, even though most have the basic ""good/okay/bad"" structure. You have pages and pages of aspects (powers), many with custom rules, even though most are used solely by invoking their name in a moment of narrative applicability. 12 damage types despite combat not being the main focus. Milestone advancement instead of XP. No one thing was ""wrong,"" but there was a lot more ""Let me look that up"" than felt necessary.

**Building ships is more fun than sailing them**. This is a direct benefit of the previous statement. There are 25 pages for building ships, and my players had a blast combing through upgrade options every time they had stake to spend. This was true even though Journeys (their main use) aren't great and ship-based combat didn't feel amazing either. Just the theoretical payoff of making their ship cooler was a sufficient reward.

**More random tables would be great, but there's still gold here**. With the world being so distinct, I'd love a few more random tables to help make journeys, reaches, and encounters easier to think up. The closest this gets is reach-specific Watch tables, but it didn't feel sufficient. I used a number of unofficial online random generators to help where I could. However, two things were amazing: randomly generating NPC characters and ships using the player rules. Because both are largely a serious of (incredibly varied) descriptive tags, you could trivially create a new NPC or ship and have it stand out.

# Perspective after playing

These were my takeaways afterwards:

* I wonder if I just played [**Fate**](https://evilhat.com/product/fate-core-system/)? We got the most mileage out of the system when we used its descriptive tags as game fodder (whether that be aspects, specimens, ships, or other).
* I'm less eager than I thought to buy a system for its detailed worldbuilding. Internalizing it was hard, but extending it was also hard.
* The promise (cool world, cool ships) didn't pan out for us, which left us feeling disappointed and ready to move on.

# Roses

* **Unsetting questions**. I often ask for player input, but ""Tell me something that might be true"" was really powerful. It gave me explicit permission to adjust player contributions, and let players contribute wild ideas without stressing about continuity up front.
* **Cool random tags**. If you set the rules aside, there were so many flavorful tags for everything: players, ships, specimens. It greatly helped with improvisation.
* **Cool shipbuilding**. Ships are detailed enough that just tinkering with them in port was still satisfying.

# Thorns

* **Overly complex**. Crunchier than Blades, for too little payoff.
* **Journeys were broken**. We tried the Journey rules every session but never got them to be fun. The closest we found was using ""chart + whisper"" once per trip and moving on.
* **Someone else's world**. The world was awesome, but absorbing or expanding it (while staying true to the vibe) turned out to be a struggle.

Every ambiance music I look for, every map that I search, every tool I look up, feels incredibly D&D-y, and it makes finding things that are actually useful to me, in my post-apocalyptic horror setting, or my ~~cyberpunk~~ space action setting, or my modern world political drama setting, all the more difficult

When trying to prep for ambiance music, for example, I can't just look up ""RPG music"", since EVERYTHING that will pop up feels taylored specifically for D&D, with instruments, melodies and moods resembling medieval fantasy tropes

When trying to look up maps, I'm lucky if 1 every 10 maps can be used for my setting. When trying to find inspiration, I better have my own sources, otherwise the time to find something may be longer than the time to come up with something on my own

I don't want to come off as angry at the medieval fantasy enjoyers- one reason for it to be so popular is that it works well, but trying to find or prep things beforehand can be so exhausting when you're trying to deviate from the norm...

Edit: Ok, I'm going to make this explicit here- I won't be answering comments saying how I just ""don't need music"" or ""don't need maps"" or that I should just ""google better"". The point was never that I NEED those things to live and can't possibly get them, but rather that it is exponentially more difficult if you're not just medieval fantasy.

1318,60,1jc57c4,I finally realized Crunchy RPGs makes it very fulfilling and satisfying,"I played Chronicles of Darkness/World of Darkness for about 27 years, which is medium-crunch, and we've been getting into rules-light RPGs for a few years now, but there was something that I couldn't really put my finger on with rules-light RPGs. I found rules-light RPGs fun, fast, and easy to get into. Mork Borg is such game for me. But I kept feeling like something was...missing. I kept reading and reading on the latest rules-light RPGs to try and find one that would fit my needs. And they somewhat did. But it wasn't enough. I felt empty. So one day I decided to give Mythras a try and it was a hurdle to overcome learning the rules and making a heavy character sheet. But after getting past all that, I realized it was really *easy* to play. Combat is crunchy still, but I found it satisfying. I could feel like I'm grounded in its world and I could feel like my character had meaning, even if he could die anytime. The character sheet made it feel alive and I realized it brought me the same feeling I had from Chronicles of Darkness, even if half of the stuff on the sheet wasn't used. Now when I look at rules-light ones, it feels like the character is ""floaty"" with barely anything on it and the mechanics are too simple - hit, miss, hit, miss, hit, miss. Nothing wrong with that, it gets players in faster with turns coming around faster. Like OSR. With crunchy rules, it makes you *think* strategically, where to position your character, how to encounter and solve problems,  and it's tense and exciting. It completely engaged my brain. Now, all of that being said, rules-light RPGs are *still* a great way to welcome new players that have never played before and might be something quick to pop out during a snowstorm when the power goes out or the apocalypse comes when boredom strucks or whatever.

One of the few times I've played online with strangers was a D&D game where the DM had created this elaborate, complicated world with extensive lore and details. We were all excited to play in it (we had met up online and gotten a preview of the world before the first session). Sounded so damn cool.

Session one comes in, and the DM simply *dropped us in the middle of a city with no goals or threads to follow*. I distinctly remember all of us looking confused as hell. Basically, it's a fine day in the city, y'all wake up, bla bla bla. Mind you that our PCs were not even together; he described the morning for each one of us individually.

Finally, my turn comes. ""Um, okay, I head out to the city's main plaza to check things out"".

GM proceeds to describe merchants and stuff that detailed their world lore.

""I want to walk around the plaza, looking for something unusual"", I say, trying to crank things up without being the asshole ""I punch an innocent citizen"" kind of player to falsely create action.

""You see nothing out of the ordinary, just the usual blah blah blah..."" He goes off describing more world lore and things.

This went on forever. We played a total of almost two hours. We were four players and in the end only two PCs finally met up (myself and another). The other two remained isolated. The session just sort of ended with no quests, no cliffhangers, nothing...

1326,68,1inwwub,I recently finished GM'ing a 3 year Mutants and Masterminds Campaign. This is my review of the system.,"Three years ago I got an urge to run a superhero focused campaign, and after some research settled on Mutants and Masterminds 3rd Edition as my system of choice. Three years later I have finished said campaign, and want to share what I learned with others who may be considering it. This is less a ""is it good or bad"" review, and more a breakdown of some finer points of the system that are not as evident on a first (or second, or third, or twentieth) pass. If you are considering running this system, hopefully this will be helpful to you.

**The Power System:**

If you are familiar with M&M at all, it is likely because of the power system. Mutants and Masterminds promises to let you build any power. No matter how strange or unique, it will work out of the box. There is no home brew necessary, and you get it all in a single, visually appealing book (looking at you GURPS). At this it succeeds wonderfully.

In my group we had a shapeshifter, a teleporting shadow man, an elementalist whose powers were fueled by different emotions, a librarian who could summon people from books she reads, and a crab man with a collection of powers so eclectic it would make golden age superman blush. All of these, along with a small platoon of variably powered npcs, worked with minimal hiccups.

However, I don't believe this system will click for everyone. Learning M&M's power system is like learning a foreign language or coding. Some will intuitively get that their flurry of fist attack should be a damage 5, multi-attack, or that their mech suit will obviously need to be at least growth 4, but for others that will forever be gobbledygook. Players who put in the effort will figure it out eventually, but not everyone is going to do that. This is not a criticism of the system, it's just advice. If you want to run this, make sure you have players who are capable of cracking open a rulebook on their own time. And understand that, even if your players do put in the time, it is inevitable that someone will eventually get something wrong, and you will end up having to tell them that their cool new power doesn't do what they want it to do. 

Also, I highly recommend the Gadget and Powers guides. They are by far the most useful supplements.

**Abusing the Power System:**

I said there there were some minor hiccups with the power system, but they could be larger depending on your group. No one in my group went out of their way to abuse the system. However, some accidentally did just by making their character concept. One player who did this was the shapeshifter. His concept was that he was a biologist who could alter the makeup of his body. A cool and powerful ability. He even built in a weakness that he had to pass a biology check to use his power. However, we quickly realized that this meant he could alter himself to have ideal stats for whatever he was doing. There were drawbacks to this, but RAW not enough to keep him from being the perfect jack of all trades, and master of all as well. This frequently got in the way of other people getting their own unique thing. Thankfully this player realized this, and got out of other people's way, but a more obnoxious player could really ruin a session with this sort of thing. 

But that's fairly minor compared to the other player who accidentally broke the system. Our librarian was played by the most inexperienced player at the table, and her power was that she could summon people from books. An overpowered-sounding ability, but tempered by her needing to actually spend time reading the passage, and the people she summons being limited by her power. Or at least, that was the idea. In practice it turned out that summons are busted. This is not a problem unique to this system. Plenty of other system have this issue where summons break action economy, particularly when you can have multiple of them. Mutants and Masterminds compounds this though by you summon a small army for a fairly low points investment. This was the power I had to homebrew the most stuff for, as this system just doesn't have any practical rules for controlling large groups, and even then it would have been completely overpowered, had the person playing it wanted to break the power.

A players ability to break this system is only limited by their intent. There are tons of different things you can do with Afflictions, but if you aren't worried about flavor then some of them are just straight up better than others. Some of the ""negatives"" basically do nothing. Regeneration can completely invalidate Damage, and Weakness always seemed to give an extremely high value for how easy it is to land and how cheap it is points-wise.

These are small examples, and I've seen and come up with even crazier combos. Plus, I'm confident there's someone out there who has theory-crafted things well beyond what I've thought of. The point is, you need to understand going into the system that it can be pretty easily broken, and you and your players will need to figure out how you all feel about that.

**The Challenge:**

Mutants and Masterminds is a d20 system. A 1 is not an auto-fail, and a 20 is not an auto-succeed, though a 20 does give you an increase to your degrees of success or failure. Characters in M&M also tend to have high modifiers in the stats they care about. It is common for a character to have a +15 or even a +20 to certain rolls. In addition to that, there is also a meta currency called hero points which not only allows rerolls, but also guarantees the rerolls are better. What this all means is that players tend to succeed at rolls. This makes sense, they are superheros, but it changes the way you design encounters. An inability to fail is boring, so to make interesting challenges you either need extremely difficult tasks (DCs of 30+) or to deliberately target your players weaknesses. 

This may sound obvious when spelled out - that's how things work for superheros in comics and movies - but in practice this is actually quite hard. Not every encounter can involve kryptonite. Not every encounter can be the world ending monster. If you start at 11 you have nowhere to go. You want variety, but most smaller encounters are a waste of time. My group got around this in two ways. The first was role play - spending more time on character stuff. The second was world building that kept letting me raise the stakes. However, every group has a different approach to role play, and in a more traditional defending the city superhero setting expanding stakes becomes more difficult. 

M&M is also a high powered setting. Players can lift multiple tons, fly, teleport, go through walls, see into the past, etc. This is cool, but also invalidates most non-combat encounters. It's hard to have a murder mystery when a player can talk to ghosts. It's hard to create a heist when a player can teleport. You might think you can just not have encounters that your players can invalidate, but your players may have *a lot* of different powers. The only surefire way around this is to create systems that explicitly stop players from using their powers for these things. The villain has created an anti-teleport field around their base. The victim was killed with a knife that also absorbs his soul. Plenty of people dislike these sorts of workarounds though, and for good reason. It can be unfair and unfun to deliberately keep a player from doing their things. Besides it can be entertaining when a player just gets to feel powerful by invalidating some challenge. However, deliberately targeting a character's weakpoints is part of the genre, and invalidating a challenge once might be funny and empowering, but the more you do it the more it starts to feel boring. 

If you want to have a variety of encounters, and keep them fun and challenging, you will likely have to engage in a bit of GM fiat. If you are strongly against that, this system may cause you some problems in the long run.

Hero points are a double-edged sword for this. On the one hand, they encourage players to actively make use of their weaknesses. On the other hand, they are extremely powerful, and with careful use players can make it highly likely they succeed at everything. I personally found them too plentiful, and ended up making it so players keep them from session to session (with a cap), but only get them from doing heroic things or encountering their weakness. Before this change my players just treated them as per session re-roll batteries. After this change I found that my players were more proactive in thinking of how their unique weaknesses could affect them and get them more points.

**Combat:**

After three years of using this system, I can now confidently state that I do not like the way damage works. It seems simple. You make a save, and if you fail bad enough you are out. It allows for classic one punch scenarios while also letting two super-tough, super-strong characters duke it out. It even avoids the problem of slicing at the big monsters legs until it dies of a thousand cuts.

At least, it does this in theory. In practice the whole thing is much fiddlier than it first seems. AC is the defense modifier plus 10, then you make a toughness save, but that's damage +15. Then you get a stacking -1 from each failure, but not degree of failure, plus a further minus depending on the roll. This minus only comes from damage, so don't add in affliction failures, unless they also do damage. And if you have regeneration remember to remove the conditions first, then the -1, or was it the other way around? Also, whats the effect of 2 degrees of failure? 

The number of exceptions and edge cases can make it difficult for even experienced players to remember exactly how everything works. And the upshot is that sometimes you can attack for turn after turn and feel like you are doing nothing, and oftentimes a fight just ends in the least exciting way possible. This is not really a system that excels at random outcomes and divergent possibilities. It is a system where you play as larger than life characters engaging in epic battles. Put another way, immediately one-shotting Thanos because he failed his Will save is funny exactly one time.  

There are ways around this. Mostly be giving your big super-villains enough immunities that beating them turns into more of a puzzle than a traditional fight. For instance, maybe the psychic mummy king can only be hurt after getting the scarab amulet into his heart. But, his heart is on a space station in orbit and protected by a constantly changing laser grid, so players will have to go through that while holding him off. Some groups may like that. Some may not. Either way, it's not something you will learn how to do from the book. And, it requires you to sometimes ignore the specifics of the power rules for major villains. 

Finally, there is some fiddleness with distance. Characters in M&M can move hundreds of miles in a single turn. They can be 50 feet tall. They can snipe targets on the moon. Yet, for some reason there are still powers in this book that give exact distances. You cannot use maps for a system like this, beyond just general positioning. Yet, the rules occasionally care if two characters are standing 11 feet apart or 10. This is difficult when a fight takes place across a museum. This is impossible when a fight takes place across an entire city. I have no solution for this other than to just decide what feels right.

**Leveling Up:**

A word of warning about character advancement. Increasing power levels over time can make character concepts less defined. Players usually start with enough points to do their thing, which means more points just tends to encourage them to dilute their concept. Personally, looking back, I don't think this is a great system for a long form campaigns where characters are expected to get stronger over time. Characters often feel less interesting as they get more points, not more.

**Final Thoughts:**

To summarize everything: what is Mutants and Masterminds good for? Absolutely some things. If you want street level heroes who struggle against normal mooks, I would leave it on the shelf. If you want a more traditional dungeon crawler, but with superhero theming, leave it on the shelf. If you want tight, tactical battles leave this book on the shelf.

However, if you want a wide variety of wacky abilities in a high powered setting, are ok with a bit of GM fiat, and have players who will engage with the rules without trying to break them, this system can really sing.

1327,69,1ca00kj,I'm an experienced GM with an experienced group of players and I ran Daggerheart. Here are my thoughts.,"So some background on me and the group. There’s me who has been a forever GM for close to 25 years. My group (Bard, Guardian, Seraph, and Sorcerer) and I are quite experienced both individually and together. Two things to note is that Bard and Guardian are far more active roleplayers than Seraph and Sorcerer who tend to be focused more on combat and mechanics but we all mesh well. We’ve been doing Cyberpunk: Red for a while and since we just finished an arc we decided to take a break for a one shot and possibly a short campaign with Daggerheart.

**EDITED TO ADD**: Daggerheart is a RPG in open beta by Darrington Press and designed by many of the Critical Role folk. The primary mechanic is rolling 2d12 with one d12 being ""Hope"" the other being ""Fear."" Rolling a higher Fear than Hope (regardless if it's a success or not) means ""rolling with Fear"" which either throws in a complication then and there or gives the DM a ""Fear"" token which they can use to trigger a complication later. Rolling a higher Hope (regardless if it's a failure or not) means ""rolling with Hope"" and gives the player a Hope token they can use for certain class abilities or other things like helping an ally or to use your ""experience"" (a sort of catchall for skills, feats and so forth) when it is narratively relevant.

For the one shot I used a heavily modified version of the Quickstart Adventure with minis but used as just a rough estimation of where everybody was in relation to one another. There’s a lot more combat and a more ‘on-rails’ plot than I normally run but no more than my usual one-shot where time is essential.

# Good

* Everyone liked the Hope/Fear mechanic itself on paper. The possibility of complications is something we liked from Forged In The Dark games and succeeding with Fear was a big hit.
* Although it took up a lot of room, they enjoyed the cards on abilities for ease of reference.
* The combat mechanics went over well especially with the threshold and armor system preventing combat from getting too swingy.
* Once we got in the groove of the action tracker it seemed to run far more smooth than other variants of initiative we’ve tried. Since I absolutely DESPISE the default initiative system that D&D and Pathfinder have I’m always looking for better ideas so this was a huge win for me as well although I do have a caveat (more on that later).
* Everyone seemed to like the heritage/ancestry/subclass system and had a lot of fun roleplaying their heritage (although Seraph used the Firbolg ancestry she changed the skin of it to a polar bear). Having heritage/ancestry/subclass abilities that actually matter was also popular with Bard making a lot of jokes about his Faun kicking the skull off a skeleton.
* Fear was a good mechanic to keep the narrative interesting but without it feeling like purely DM fiat.
* Loved the way adversaries are presented and organized (with roles and tiers). Considering the thing I like the least about 5e is how awful it is with giving DMs the tools to create a balanced encounters, this was a blessing. While it’s not as mathematically precise as Pathfinder, I like this system a bit more as it’s a little easier to put together. The spread of creatures was also nice.
* Sorcerer reported loving playing a melee orc magic user with armor and slinging spells even if the spell list was quite limited. Part of this was with my lore pushing orcs to act like Klingons from Star Trek or Clanners from Battletech but overall it was a cool change from D&D.
* Speaking of which, the positives are how Daggerheart diverged from 5e with classes like Guardian and Seraph. I wish they had gone all the way.

# Bad

* The biggest problem (which many of the others will be branched from) is the lack of a unifying mechanic. You have hit points, armor points, stress points, Hope tokens, and even abilities with THEIR OWN tokens. It felt ‘busy’ according to one player and everyone agreed.
* That being said, my players had a TON of Hope tokens by the end of the battle with very little to spend them on. Maybe they rolled really well or we missed something or we picked abilities and subclasses that didn’t use them very much but having so many didn’t seem like a good thing.
* There was some confusion if an Experience can be spammed for an entire battle if the objective fits. For example Guardian had “Bodyguard” and Seraph had “Holy Warrior”. Since they were protecting a wizard from evil necromancers and animated skeletons I let both players used their Experience during combat although they had to keep using Hope tokens (although as noted having enough Hope wasn’t really an issue). Not sure if this was intended but maybe some clarification could work.
* Combat was rather easy though part of this may have been short rests being too good (more on that in a bit). If I were running it again for four players, I would definitely amp up the difficulty.
* The Action Tracker worked great for our group. However, even we saw the potential for this to be a problem for others. This system is definitely not for people who aren’t interested in collaborative storytelling or want something closer to a board or war game during combat. That will be a considerable amount of 5e players I imagine.
* The players did like the cards but found the ‘cheat sheet’ that pointed to different parts of the character sheet were worthless especially with the table already crowded.
* While I’m a fan of combat with broadly defined ranges it still was hard to run theater of the mind. Halfway through we decided life was easier with figures although we used it more as a way to represent distances more than granular movement in 5e or Pathfinder.
* Short Rests felt too good. Even with three short rests before a long rest felt too powerful especially. As mentioned with players having too much Hope this is compounded with Short Rests allowing multiple players getting 2 Hope. There definitely needs to be more adjustments made here. This may be balanced with stronger adversaries.
* The flip side of Seraph and Guardian were the copies of other classes from 5e. I was hoping there would be more innovation than just two classes and importing the rest straight from 5e. Looking for this to be improved at least a little bit.

# Ugly

So this being a module with my changes it could be a bit unbalanced but considering the only change I made was ADDING a combat and my players finished the adventure with only moderate damage and a short rest to spare I think the adventure is too easy. I’ll be experimenting with adventures made from scratch using their recommendations. While the Action Tracker can be an issue with some groups, the biggest problem is the lack of things to use for Hope. Again this was an on rails adventure with a focus on combat but I don’t think that fully explains the problem.

That being said, my group and I really enjoyed Daggerheart and have expressed interest in doing a short campaign at minimum. We’re also considering experimenting with some things: particularly using Hope in exchange for losing a Stress, reducing the Stress limit or eliminating it altogether since I felt this was the most extraneous stat. That could mean we go from Hope surpluses to Hope droughts but that's why we experiment.

I would say a game like Daggerheart coming from CR is going to have the ""Too crazy for Boy's Town. Too much of a boy for Crazy Town"" problem. 5e enthusiasts will dislike all the things that make it different than 5e while someone like me will dislike all the things that are too similar to 5e. Still the core of Daggerheart being narrative, collaborative, and rulings over rules doesn't look to be going anywhere, so I can't complain too much.

Well that’s my $0.02 and I'll be giving more as I run more sessions of Daggerheart.",rpg,1713754193.0,0,7796,1390
1328,70,1eh5rug,Are TTRPG's Books Just Game Master P*rn?,"In the wake of books like MORK BORG and Vermis, I have started to wonder if the TTRPG industry is mostly supported by the **idea/ potential** of taking part in TTRPG's, rather than reality of actually **playing** them. It seems that establishing impressive visuals and tone with little, or even completely without, rules can perform better financially than the majority of other well-crafted TTRPG's.

And I am not sure if this is a bad thing either. Just that it is something that may be interesting to take notice of. Personally, I find that my desktop folders and bookshelves are full of games that I have never even attempted to play, but that I do sincerely enjoy reading through, looking at the pretty pictures, and dreaming of the day that I might sit down and play them with a group of friends. Maybe I am in the minority on this, but I feel like there are probably folks out there that can relate.

TTRPG nights are hard to schedule and execute when everyone has such busy lives, but if we had all the time in the world, would we actually finally pull out all of these tucked away games and play them?

**EDIT:** *It would probably be good to mention that the games that* ***I ACTUALLY PLAY*** *are games like Mausritter. Games with fleshed out GM toolboxes, random tables, and clear/ concise rules. They get you to the table through there intuitive design. The contrast I'm pointing out is that this is not true of some of the best performing RPG related books, and I find that interesting. Not good. Not bad. Just interesting.*

**EDIT EDIT:** Yes, I know... Vermis is not a TTRPG book. *The reason I mentioned it is because it was reviewed by Questing Beast on YouTube, and it is one of the best performing videos on his channel. A channel dedicated to OSR TTRPG’s. Again, I have no problem with that, but I think it’s really intriguing! IN A GOOD WAY! I'M NOT MAD LOL*",rpg,1722479915.0,0,1881,338
1329,71,1dixe8p,Evil Genius Games is back on their crypto nonsense,"Quick note - this is about Evil **Genius** Games, best known for Everyday Heroes, Netflix lawsuits, crypto controversies, and mass resignations. This is not about Evil **Hat** Games, best known for Fate Core and related games. There's no relationship that I know of.

It looks like, once again, Evil Genius Games has dedicated itself to all the crypto shit they promised, just earlier this year, that they'd never touch. They presented at a cryptocurrency convention last month, per this reporting by ENworld. 

Some choice quotes - 

""Imagine a scenario where you could actually buy NFT utilities that are exclusive to these licenses you could actually pilot Gypsy Danger, you can carry Rambo's M60, all of these that have value that can be bought sold and traded but more importantly in the Roblox fashion we're going to allow other people to actually create their own NFTs which can be thrown onto a marketplace where they can buy, sell and trade those adventures as well.""
... 
""All the Creator Marketplace components of it, the UGC components of it, the entire utility is on chain. If you've actually played RPGs before there's a character sheet, all the components of the character sheet will have objects on it, all the objects will be NFTs. In addition to that the actual character sheet itself will be minted as an NFT as well so what that means is that if we use your character as an NPC in a future game we'll actually pay you royalties on the character itself. So the whole thing is based off of objects which are have NFT components to it.""

In other words - a complete and total misunderstanding of why (and how) people play RPGs, complete with regular crypto transactions. Yay. 

They also claim Jeff Grubb is on their staff. Jeff Grubb has disagreed with this in the past.

1330,72,1hsr633,Here's 24 tiny reviews of the 24 TTRPGs I played in 2024.,"I love TTRPGs the same way most people love charcuterie boards: meals are nice, but I love tasty little snacks even more.

For that reason, I play a lot of different games! In the spirit of the year end, here's 24 tiny reviews of the games I played this year. I'll start with all the one shots, then go into talking about campaigns.

# One Shots

**Exquisite Biome,** *Caro Asercion* (2022)

From the creator of *i'm sorry did you say street magic*, the ecology builder *Exquisite Biome* is a weird and wonderful look into an imagined natural world. I loved that it felt like a sandbox toy as much as a game -- you could use this to tell the story of an ecosystem, or to set up a world to play in later. Super original idea, only needs a deck of cards and the prompt lists.

Would love to try this one again and see just how different the ecosystem ends up.

**Plasmodics,** *Will Jobst* (2025)

A playtest! Was lucky enough to take this freaky, funky game for a spin at Breakout Con in March. The game sews together a couple tried-and-true dice mechanics with an evocative and bizarre setting that isn't shy about getting sci-fi in a weird way. Stylish and competent, I enjoyed my time with *Plasmodics* in spite of it falling outside my usual wheelhouse.

**Galactic,** *Riley Rethal* (2020)

What if a *Star Wars* RPG had the soul of the series instead of the IP rights? Rethal's 2020 *Galactic* is a diceless, GMless take on the twists and tropes of the sci-fi classic. This game is a masterclass in finding what actually matters and giving players the tools to run after it. I can totally imagine playing a full campaign of *Galactic,* but the two one-shots I ran both managed to tell robust, exciting stories within a few hours.

**Halo 'N' Horns,** *Connie Chang* (2021)

Two GMs act as angel and devil on the shoulders of a player character. This game was designed with streaming in mind, and as one third of a TTRPG stream team, I knew this had to happen.

*Halo 'N' Horns* is pretty stripped down, but the central idea is strong enough that we never felt lost at sea. I liked the push and pull, but I think this did benefit a lot from the live audience.

**Troika!,** *Daniel Sell* (2019)

*Troika!* manages to take familiar fantasy ideas and turn them completely on their heads. It feels vibrant, but with a restrained dry humour that never looks right at the camera. We played through the in-book adventure *The Blancmage & Thistle*, and I was surprised at how much player choice it felt like there was in a pretty linear adventure (literally an elevator ride). I can also totally see how it would springboard a whole adventure from there.

This was one of the games I was most nervous about running this year, but also one of my favourite experiences in retrospect. A lot of that has to do with the quality of Troika's writing, which is a real treat. The rest has to do with the smiles on my players' faces every time I said another batshit insane thing they walked into.

**A Lesser Well of Dreams,** *Jackson Tegu* (2017)

This might be my one-shot pick of the year. A true slice-of-life game, Tegu's 2017 *A Lesser Well of Dreams* is set at a drizzly cottage in the Pacific northwest with a magic well in the yard. The game is grounded in the mundanity of a small shared weekend with friends, complete with dishes and board games. The ritual of flipping coins into the well each scene keeps things engaging, and I love the punctuation of dream sequences to get a look inside character psyches.

I loved this game, and I know I'll play it again when the right mood strikes. 

**Precious Things,** *Lucas Zellers & Emily Entner* (2024)

Little dragons try to make a little dragon hoard. I played the first edition of *Precious Things,* which is very *Lasers & Feelings* (Harper, 2013). Our game was silly and cute, which was exactly what I expected. My big takeaway is that the player choice of what they're trying to hoard is the single biggest impact on your play experience. One of my players chose keys. The other chose Grogu merchandise, which, god, is the most *her* thing she could have done.

I'm curious to see what Zellers and Entner do with their second edition, which sounds like it'll be a major build-out.

**Broken Cities,** *Côme Martin* (2023)

*Broken Cities* is the most recent in a growing list of creative games from experimental French designer Côme Martin. Players explore a surreal, twisting cityscape, full of art deco accents and early 20th century technological strangeness. Our story was the direct product of Martin's clever prompt-writing, but felt wholly our own and packed a punch at the end.

To get personal for a second... I first heard about Martin's work as points of comparison to my own games, since we both designed slice-of-life coming-of-age stories with timeskips. Since then, I've kept my eyes open for opportunities to table Martin's output, and I'm not disappointed. 

**Star Crossed,** *Alex Roberts* (2019)

The freshman offering from genius designer Alex Roberts, *Star Crossed* took ""*Dread* but make it romance"" and built it up to something more than the sum of its parts. Fresh, modern, and genuinely sexy, *Star Crossed* is a game that never fails to surprise me with the rush of delightful tension it brings.

This was my sixth or seventh play of *Star Crossed*, but every time feels like butterflies.

**Cowboys with Big Hearts,** *Jason Morningstar* (2021)

Jason Morningstar is not just the designer of *Fiasco*; he's also one of the most prolific, consistent game designers in the contemporary scene. Morningstar's bread and butter is combining historical oddities with light RPG mechanics that can get almost anyone from zero to larping in minutes.

*Cowboys with Big Hearts* is a favourite of mine from Morningstar's excellent ludography, and this was my fifth or sixth playthrough of it. You're a bunch of cowpokes on their way to stop the dastardly Death Brothers... but you also have terminal heart conditions. Funnier and more tragic than you imagine, *Cowboys with Big Hearts* is an instant classic from one of the best designers working today.

**Our Haunt,** *Rae Nedjadi* (2019)

*Our Haunt* is a diceless, GMless game exploring a haunted house from the perspective of those who haunt it. I loved the prompts and playbooks, but our session mostly made me want to try this in a campaign format -- there were story elements that felt like they wanted longer to simmer than a one shot was able to give. Still, our story managed to make us all feel a little spooked and a little heartbroken, which is a perfect combo for a horror game.

**HOUNDs,** *Tyler Crumrine* (2021)

*HOUNDs* is a game about a pilot and their sentient mech, as they desperately strive to escape those who would wipe the mech's memories. We loved the central hook, and leveraged it into a story about a dance mech somehow felt completely serious and very human.

**Death of the Author,** *Sam Leigh* (2024)

*Death of the Author* is a game mostly intended for solo play: a struggle between a character and their creator. We played it as a duet game, talking through prompts and imagining a story together. I liked the little tools that Leigh gave players to circumvent expectations and influence the story -- when your powers let you subvert a scripted prompt, it feels like you're rebelling against fate.

**Goblin Market,** *Eliot Crow* (2022)

Crow's *Goblin Market* is a GMless storygame that follows the creation and exploration of a fairy night market. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the story prompts neatly snowballed into a story with gravity and intrigue, and I was thinking about this game for a couple months afterwards.

**Threadbare,** *Stephanie Bryant* (2017)

*Threadbare* is a Powered by the Apocalypse Game about broken toys. The lost toys theme is incredibly well integrated into the playbooks and worldbuilding, and the game has some very clever repair and crafting ideas that help the scrappy ethos come alive. I don't generally love PbtAs, but Bryant's work is well-realized and does exactly what it sets out to do.

**Heroic Verse,** *Kay Marlow Allen* (2024)

The only solo game I actually played solo, Allen's *Heroic Verse* is a poetry generating game with a Legend of Zelda theme. This was one of the submissions to the *Majora's Mask* game jam held in April, and I loved it enough to make a game of my own using its engine.

The full build came out a few days after I playtested it, and I really like how many different play modes there are for different creative energies! Thoughtfully themed and really quite fun. 

**Determina,** *Paki Spivey* (2024)

Another submission to the *Majora's Mask* game jam, Spivey's *Determina* is a very clever riff on hope in a doomed world. I love that this game is played without a hero: everyone is on equal footing, trying to muddle through an impossible situation. I had the good fortune to playtest this with the designer, so I can't speak to the game text, but I think it's telling how similar Spivey's submission was to mine mechanically. I love card prompts, and I love Zelda, and I loved my time with this game. 

**Eyeless Smile,** *Jackson Tegu* (2018)

Recognizing just how many games in this list I've described as ""weird,"" this game is WEIRD. Tegu's 2018 surrealist romp asks ""what if body horror, but happy instead of sad?"" It really shouldn't work, but it actually does. *Eyeless Smile* is a story about mutants in a bizarre world, and it uses a novel verse-chorus structure that reminds me a little of *Firebrands*.

**Gun & Slinger,** *Nevyn Holmes* (2021)

A three player exclusive, which means this game was designed specifically for me. *Gun & Slinger* combines weird western worldbuilding (say that three times fast) with Go Fish.

I think this is the second game here that gets the ""best as a campaign"" asterisk, because there was so much world to explore and we just saw a glimpse of it. Still, the back-and-forth was really exciting, and our doomed duo ended up as the centerpiece in a story of death and rebirth that bucked the expectations of a traditional western in just the right ways.

**Colostle,** *Nich Angell* (2022)

One more solo game played unsolo, just to round out the list. *Colostle* is by one of those maddeningly talented people who can write and illustrate it all themselves.

The world of *Colostle* \-- a giant castle so large it could be a planet -- is evocative and playful, with splashes of quirky colour throughout. I'll abstain from a full review, since we strayed pretty far from the imagined play mode, but there's a lot of material here for adventure.

# Campaigns

**Wanderhome,** *Jay Dragon* (2021)

*Wanderhome* is my favourite game, and this was the fourth campaign I've played with it since its release. A gorgeous, soft world, with brilliant prompts and the most evocative playbooks ever written. It may not be for the die-hard structure fans, but *Wanderhome*'s gentle touch is exactly what makes it so special to me. 

**Yazeba's Bed & Breakfast,** *Possum Creek Games* (2024)

The long-awaited *Yazeba's Bed & Breakfast* (*Zeeb's*) is kind of a monster. A massive, 500 page tome, *Zeeb's* is a work of madness: pages and pages of episodic story hooks, imaginative characters, and a ton of content you need to play to unlock. If *Pandemic Legacy* is a board game that rewards investment, *Yazeba's Bed & Breakfast* is the equivalent for the RPG world.

I've thoroughly enjoyed getting to know and love the baked-in cast of characters, and I really feel like I could keep playing this for years before the campaign ends. That never happens, making it high praise.

**Blades in the Dark,** *John Harper* (2017)

Harper's *Blades in the Dark* is the game I want to love but maybe don't. The playbooks are genius, the worldbuilding is brilliant, the action resolution system is fine clockwork... but the actual process of running and playing the game sometimes leaves me feeling a little restless. To its credit, this is almost certainly a me problem: far and away the most traditional RPG I play, *Blades* has a mechanical complexity that shifts the focus away from pure narrative towards more grounded situational play. I have a huge amount of respect for the game, but this might be the last campaign I run with it.

**Fall of Magic,** *Ross Cowman* (2015)

A short, three session campaign in the dazzling *Fall of Magic*. I played with a couple friends in real life, using the beautiful scroll that *Fall of Magic* is embedded into. I love the simple, scene-driven gameplay that Cowman coaxes out of a few words and images. One of my friends loved this campaign so much that he bought the game and ran his own; the other was a little lost with so much open space to play. Me? I'm looking forward to playing its successor, *City of Winter*, in 2025.

1331,73,1glekpl,Playing in person is just better.,"Caveat: I play online a lot. I have long term gaming friends spread across the country. I am very grateful that there are tools we can use to play together despite that distance.

  
With that said: I just returned from Carnage Con in Killington VT where I ran 4 sessions (one The One Ring 2E Moria adventure; 3 sessions of a Shadowdark mini con-campaign) and I am reminded just how much better it is to play in person. Worlds better. Impossibly better.

RPGs are inherently a conversation, and all conversations (from a chat with your BFF to a meeting with HR to an academic intellectual debate) are better in person where you can read body language, respond to non-verbal cues and otherwise engage the complete conversation rather than a partial limited form of the conversation.

If you, like me, are mostly stuck playing online because of scheduling and/or distance, i am not trying to convince you to not do that. Those games are good and valuable. but I am suggesting you seek out opportunities to play TTRPGs in person if you have not in a while.

It's so good.

Caveat 2: I realize that there are some people who have a very difficult time with in person interactions and I am not discounting your needs or preferences.

1337,79,1h1eu8s,Rant: I hate being the most passionate one in the group.,"We've all felt it. We're super passionate about yhe game we're in or just RPGs in general. We inherently want to get better at our job (either gm or player) to give everyone and yourself a better experience but the table is not as passionate. Obviously the answer is to talk to your players and sort out mismatched expectations in Session 0 and I've done that, but it doesn't change the gnawing small resentment for others not giving it like 10 or 15% more effort.

I've been learning more and more that I might have ADHD, all my friends are saying ""duh, you didn't notice?"" but I was tested when I was 8 and told I was just hyperactive so I accepted that. I'm now almost 27 and trying to deal with a much more difficult situation as I figure this all out. One of the illuminating things is the level to which I hyperfixate. I've always been super passionate about one thing then I'll hop to a new thing and be super passionate about that. For a bit in highschool it was Metal Gear Solid or FFXIV, or some new anime, or drawing. The obvious most recent one is RPGs. I am so fucking passionate about RPGs. I read rules for games I'll never play to get ideas for how I can do new things or make the games better for my players, I read blogs and listen to podcasts about theory, I am the sole person buying the books for my groups, hell I made a blog so I'd stop blasting one of my friends with inane rpg thoughts over discord.

And my players just can't match my freak, it's literally impossible and so I resent them a tiny bit but more so I resent the situation. I wish I was less passionate cause thats something I could theoretically control, I can't control how excited my players are outside of just doing a good job and making a game that responds to them.

I know the solution is finding players outside of my friends who can be this excited about stuff but 50% of RPGs for me are spending time with my friends and showing them stuff that makes me so fucking excited and hoping I can share that excitement with them.

1339,81,1ena0w7,The Cosmere TTRPG is a DnD/PF hack with quirks and I am... sad?,"So I was about to back the Kickstarter and bankrupt my self for a few months, but I decided to read the Beta before. I saw the videos and really liked the Paths and Goals idea, it sounded like a good implementation for the Cosmere as Setting.

But then I started reading: 

• D20? Sure, it's a fun dice anyway. 

• Testing skills? Yeah, that's good too. 

• Six attributes? Ok...? 

• Ranks in skills that are by default associated with an attribute? Not my favorite thing, but sure. 

• Advantage, disadvantage, three actions, short rest and long rest? Wait. Wait... Is this DnD? 

• Imperial System for carrying capacity? Really?

I don't know why I was expecting something else, I was kind of hoping for a new kind of design that was unique to the Cosmere. I was looking forward to reading new takes on rules.

I mean, nothing against DnD, because it seems that the system works for the heroic high magic fantasy that the Cosmere is and what modern DnD is supposed to do well, the Beta reads as a thought out system and it will be easier to convince the people who already play DND.

On the other hand, such a compelling IP wouldn't even need to present something revolutionary, because fans would buy anything Cosmere anyway. I mean, I'm complaining about the system, but I'm still debating myself because of how invested I am and how much I want Cosmere themed books, dice and all.

Anyway, end of rant. Did anyone here felt something similar when reading/looking at the system?

Edit: I didn't noticed the character information was on demiplane. I wasn't expecting for it to be elsewhere instead of the beta document. With that context and comments around here, I know I reacted strongly against it being a DnD-like game, especially when reading the skills and weapons. But I now understand that it is more an interesting synthesis of other rulesets",rpg,1723133516.0,0,1855,327
1340,82,1erbtmr,"How long does it take to publish your own RPG by yourself? 8 years, turns out! AMA!","Hi there. My name is Josh McCrowell, and for the last 8 years I wrote a game called *[His Majesty the Worm](http://hismajestytheworm.games/)*. It came out last month!

I'm holding a public AMA here to celebrate the release of the game and hold a retrospective about my experiences getting a book to print without traditional publishing or crowdfunding support.

### What's His Majesty the Worm?

*His Majesty the Worm* is a new-school game with old-school sensibilities: the classic megadungeon experience given fresh life through a focus on the mundanities and small moments of daily life inside the dungeon. Food, hunger, light, and inventory management are central to play and actually fun. Tarot cards are used to create an action-packed combat system that ensures that all players have interesting choices every minute of combat: no downtime! If you like things like Dungeon Meshi or Rat Queens, you might find something fun in this game.

You can learn more about the game, and find links to buy either the physical or digital editions, on our [website](http://hismajestytheworm.games/)! **Preview chapters** (over 100 pages of content) are hosted on our Itch page, which is also linked from the site. 

(When it launched, the physical edition sold out within 3 hours. ~~The books are now restocked at Exalted Funeral!~~ Whoops just sold out again. Sorry about that! You can sign up to be notified of the restocks on Exalted Funeral's website.)

### How did you publish it?

Essentially, I worked one day a week on Sundays. I wrote the outline of a game and playtested it with friends. 

I have a lot of skepticism around the way games are currently crowdfunded, and knew I wanted to avoid running my own Kickstarter campaign. Instead, I used **Itchfunding** to fund art, editing, graphic design, layout, copyediting, and other things I can't do by myself. 

I put sample chapters, with very rough layout and art, onto Itch. Mostly, these were put up as pay-what-you-will (PWYW). Every time I accumulated enough scratch to pay somebody (e.g., commission a single piece of art), I did so. 

Part of the above process was doing a lot of self-driven marketing. I can talk about that too.

When the book was basically done, I shopped around for someone to print it for me. Eventually, Exalted Funeral agreed to publish it for me and split the printing fees. Now it's out! Hooray!

---

So if you want to chat about the process of independently publishing your own game or learn more about the Worm, please ask me anything! 

~~I'll be answering questions from 12:00 pm EST to 5 pm EST.~~

**Update:** Thanks so much for your questions and support, y'all. I need to step away now. During this AMA, *His Majesty the Worm* sold out (again!). You can sign up for my newsletter to be notified of restocks at the website: http://hismajestytheworm.games/

1343,85,1ffhvu5,"CAIN (the newest game by Tom Bloom, one of the authors of Lancer) is some of the best, leanest design I’ve ever seen ","And it’s all because of 2 simple mechanics:

Before I go into those, a bit of preamble. CAIN uses a similar system to Blades in the Dark, what with rolling dice pools hoping for sufficient successes from that pool, and then the GM narrates the world’s response. Minimal dice rolling on the GM’s side. This is where the first of these brilliant mechanics come in.

Rather than the GM’s narration being Freeform and “as seems appropriate”, the GM rolls something nifty called the Risk Die if the action could be considered “risky” (say, smacking a monster with a sharp stick). The result on the risk die determines what responses the GM has access to, and they’re often altered given the scenario or monster the party is hunting. Aside from just being a bit more even regarding the mechanical load, and really helping avoid choice paralysis, it does a brilliant job getting you into the appropriate mindset. Cain is very horror-shonen (more chainsawman than jujutsu kaisen), and so the game centres on hunting monsters created from human trauma. The responses they have access to are coloured by that trauma, meaning mindset, when playing them, is vital. It’s nice to be just genuinely barred from running a vengeful rage-monster as being too deliberating. It also adds my favorite element to any game: degrees of success. Winning and still getting screwed over by the Risk Die is frequent, as is losing and being blessedly safe. 

Next is Category. Keeping with shonen tradition, Cain has a ranking system, and that is Category. Category determines the strength, reach, speed, etc, of your powers and you. It’s such a simple leveling system that allows for meaningful growth in capability while sidestepping any need for getting bogged down in calculation. There’s also always a simple cool factor in dropping someone of a higher Category into the world and pointing to them to say “hey, you’re gonna be able to do that eventually”.

The rest of the game is nothing exceptionally different from Blades, if it weren’t for some innovations present I’d call it just a very good FitD hack. But they’re great rules, it’s a great book, and I’m having a blast running it.",rpg,1726187693.0,0,2163,367
1344,86,1cyiszs,Resentment of D&D grows ,"My LGS has a D&D one-shot every weekend and is open to having other ttrpgs ran if a GM wants to run them. This is my second time running “The Zone” and I’ve planned a two parter. The problem? Everyone who regularly plays Saturdays will only ever touch D&D. For example, my game on Saturday has had a thread for two weeks now and next to no interest outside of myself. Then you get other people posting about how they are thinking about buying a D&D supplement and running it and that one throw-away post gets more engagement. It's depressing because it makes 
me feel that there is no reason to bother running anything other than D&D because it's the only thing that will get attention. It's not just me either, but another GM tried running the ATLA ttrpg and only got three people counting himself, compared to the average D&D session that is capped and people are always asking to be slotted in",rpg,1716433516.0,0,896,164
1345,87,1f1o1xp,"It's not about the quantity of crunch, it's about the quality of crunch","I was playing the Battletech miniature wargame and had an epiphany: People talk about how many rules, but they don't talk that about *how good* those rules are.

If the rules are good, consistent, intuitive and fun... then the crunch isn't that hard. It becomes a net positive.

Consistent and intuitive rules are easier to learn. They complement each other, make sense and appeal to common sense. If a game has few, inconsistent and unintuitive rules, the learning process becomes harder. I saw campaigns die because the ""lite"" rules were meh. While the big 300 pages book kept several campaigns alive.

We have 4 decades debating and ruling what the OD&D thief can and can't do, but everyone understands what newer crunchier edition rogues can do. In fact, is easier to build a rogue that does what I want (even a rogue that transforms into a bear!).

Good and fun mechanics are easier to learn because it's motivating to play with them.

Mechanics are one of the things you actually *feel* as a person. We roll different dice, see different effects, use different procedures, it's visceral. So in my experience, they add to immersion. If each thing has it's own mechanics, it makes me feel different things in the story.

Do mech's in battletech have 3 modes of movement with different rules? Yes, but all the tactical decisions and trade offs that open up are fun. Speed *feels* different. Shooting moving targets, or while moving, is harder. The machine builds heat and can malfunction. Terrain and distance matters. It's a lethal dance on an alien planet.

Do I have to chose feats every time I level up in PF2e? Yes, but it's a tangible reward every level up. I get a new trick. I customize my class, my ancestry, my skills. Make my character concept matter. It allows me to express myself. Make my dwarf barbarian be *my* dwarf barbarian.

It's tactile, tangible at the table.

Good mechanics support the game and the narrative. They give us tools to make a kind of story happen. A game about XYZ has rules to make that experience. Transhuman horror in Eclipse Phase; space adventuring, exploration and trading in Traveller; detailed magic and modern horror in Mage: the Awakening; heroic fantasy combat and exploration in Pathfinder 2e; literal Star Trek episodes in Star Trek Adventures; a game with a JRPG style in Fabula Ultima; silly shenanigans in Paranoia.

Mechanics are a way to interface with the story, to create different narratives. My barbarian frightens with a deathly glare, their buddy cleric frightens by calling their mighty god and the monster frightens them with sheer cosmic horror. Each works in a different way, has different chances of working. And the frightened condition matters, my character is affected, and so am I.

(This is a more subjective point, because every table will need different supports for their particular game and story. The creator of Traveller saw actual combat, so he didn't need complicated combat rules. He knew how shoot outs went. While I, luckily, never saw combat and like to have rules that tell me how a gunshot affects my PC)

Making rulings for each new situation that comes up is still work (and ""rulings not rules"" can be an excuse to deliver an unhelpful product). In crunchy games:

A) The ruling work is already done, I have *helpful tools* at mu disposal

B) I probably won't need to look for it again

C) I have a solid precedent for rulings, some professional nerds made good rulings for me and codified them

In my experience, it saves me time and energy because the game jumps to help me. The goblin barbarian attempts to climb up the dragon. Well, there are athletic and acrobatic rolls, climbing rules, grappling rules, a three action economy, the ""lethal"" trait, off-guard condition, winging it with a +4 to attack... it's all there to use, I don't have to invent it in the spot because I have precedents that inspire my ruling.

In conclusion: crunch isn't bad if the crunch is good. And IMO, good crunchy is better than mediocre rules light.

For me personally it would have to be Call of Cthulhu, you roll up 8 different stats and none of them do anything, then you need to pick an occupation before divvying out a huge number of skill points among the 100 different skills with little help in terms of which skills are actually useful. Not to mention how many of these skills seem almost identical what's the point of Botany, Natural World and Biology all being separate skills, if I want to make a social character do I need Fast Talk, Charm and Persuade or is just one enough?

2. An easy narrative Goals and Rewards system.
3. It's skill-based and allows eclectic or specialized characters by default, including any combination of ""multi-classing"".
4. Makes Initiative a player choice that can be either tactical or narrative-based. (Inspired by Shadow of the Demon Lord)
5. Makes basic Reactions impactful, with plenty of choices and uses.
6. ""Focus"" as a limited resource gives you many options of maneuvers or bonus effects with a balanced cost.
7. They solved the oh-no-hit-so-I-do-nothing turn of dnd martials with ""Graze"" (I don't know if it's new, but it's the first time I see it), so hitting is not only luck-based (you normally succeed on your Strike), but resource-based (if you fail at the Strike, just pay 1 focus to deal your damage-die damage as if you hit, without any damage bonus). Missing and still dealing damage at a cost feels great.
8. An easy and immediate Opportunities and Consequences system that does it's job when needed, without complex gimmicks or hindering the base rolls.
9. It's familiar enough that it's easily picked up, and doesn't alienate players.
10. Only rolling once per test with whatever dice you have to roll (d20 + Damage Die + Plot Die if needed) really makes for fast combats.
11. The Injury system promotes players overcoming challenges and character-story progression, while not heavily penalizing combat or risking easy character death, even at level 1.
12. The Recovery Die keeps resources (health and focus) tight, but still rechargable once per scene.

I also find the respect they've shown to GMs really refreshing; especially the attention they've shown to the Adversaries, with special Traits and Abilities that fit their role and play great at the table (even little details, like the Warform War-pairs moving together with a Reaction is just *chef's kiss*, such an easy way to represent their relationship and coordination). You can easily recognize that some people that worked on Flee Mortals! are also working on this project.

I can see myself home-brewing traditional fantasy Paths just to use it outside the Cosmere, and as far as Roshar is concerned they're doing a great job at adapting the Surges for what we've seen.

What about games where you like the mechanics but the setting ruins it for you? This is a question of personal taste, so no shame if you simply don't like setting XYZ for whatever reason. Bonus points if you've found a way to adapt the rules to fit setting or lore details you like better.

For me it'd be Golarion and the Forgotten Realms. As settings they come off as very safe with only a few lore details here or there that happen to be interesting and thought provoking. When you get into the books that inspired original D&D (stuff by Michael Moorcock and Fritz Lieber) you find a lot of weird fantasy.

Copied from my email:

[This particular announcement comes to you as a member of COTI.]
[By the way, the Emperor's Birthday is August 29, (or 241-2024 in the Imperial notation). ]

>
Some years ago, fellow game designer Greg Stafford died, and I was impressed that his company announced almost immediately that he had a succession plan in place, and that his legacy and his designs would live on.

His example was an inspiration to me, and I resolved to emulate him. It would be a terrible loss if Traveller were encumbered, or somehow restricted in its outreach to present and future fans.

With that in mind, I have worked to make Traveller an asset to science-fiction role-players... with our user-friendly Fair Use policies, with the Travellers’ Aid Society programs, with the Cepheus editions of Traveller, and with Mongoose as a primary publisher of their edition of Traveller.

Over the past several years, I have turned over more and more responsibilities to Mongoose, and I have collaborated actively with them as they work to realize the Traveller dream. Earlier this year I passed full ownership of Traveller to Mongoose in order to secure its future.

With that in mind, I point out that, following the example of Greg Stafford, I have a succession plan in place: day-to-day decisions about the Traveller game system are already being made by Mongoose Publishing (with my co-operation and approval), and if anything should happen to me, they would carry on with my full knowledge and blessing.

That doesn’t stop me from speaking my mind: expressing opinions about Traveller, writing stories and lore, and even revealing secrets about the universe.

But Traveller is in good hands, now, and far into the far future.

And I thank you for your (continuing) support for Traveller.

Now, I have no problem when an author chooses to do so, but it is thoroughly dishonest and misleading when they list themselves as the artist in the credits section when you can tell the images were done by a program. Hands do not look right, weapons are held the wrong way, the outfits worn by two different people merge together, and a host of other small details show the picture is not right.

1363,105,1f45tsy,Anyone else hate the idea of builds having to come 'online'?,"In CRPGs & TTRPGs, I've grown to hate this idea of builds needing to come 'online' over the years. In games with Character Levels in particular there seems to be a wild variation in how you're able to build a character type or implement an idea of what a character can do or be, based purely on when the concept comes 'online'.

The 'build' in my mind and in this case is standing in the way of the character and story.

In 5e/BG3 for instance, The Assassin class fails to fulfil the role/fantasy of an Assassin in a particularly thematic, interesting or tactical way. The most common suggestion for getting around this is to multiclass it with a Ranger Gloomstalker, which has a bunch of nifty level 3 abilities that really compliment the Assassin's 'theme'.

This is fine in theory, except that to start to play the character you want to play, you need to reach *at least Level 6.* You have to have played the game for some indeterminate amount of time before you can play the *game or your character* the way you'd like to play it.

Now people might argue that this is done to control the power levels of characters... but *what* a character can do is half the fun of these games, and there's no reason a character shouldn't be given a useful, fun, diverse tool (in the form of an ability, spell, effect etc.) that they *can* use but require a lot of training to use *effectively* or even *well*.

A Fireball is learned and that's 8d6 of Fire damage in a radius, no prior training or use of a lesser version of the spell necessary, you just need to hit 'level 5' and suddenly you can do it. What if I want a fireball earlier? One that does 3d6 damage, but only has a small radius?

I don't know, I'm probably the only one but I'm growing to hate this system.",rpg,1724946607.0,0,1761,328

I wasn't surprised that people chose playing IRL first. Hanging out with friends and rolling dice rules.

1365,107,1hp4ou6,Proof of Concept: A Fully Offline TTRPG in a Single HTML File with Search and Bookmark Features!,"Lately, I've been hearing more and more people advocating for using Markdown and other digital formats to publish TTRPGs instead of/or in addition to PDFs. One conversation that stuck with me was from the Sly Flourish podcast, where they discussed the simplicity and accessibility of these formats and how some designers have been embracing markdon.

This got me thinking about an idea I've been tinkering with for a year or two: combining the functionality HTML pages provide with strong graphic design principles to create a single-file TTRPG. No external assets, no JPGs, PNGs, JS, or CSS files. Everything self-contained. My first attempt was for a Fallout TTRPG I was designing just for fun. It mimicked the green-screen look of the in-game terminals, complete with flickering effects and all: [https://snipboard.io/pwgxvj.jpg](https://snipboard.io/pwgxvj.jpg)

* **This is my proof of concept:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0oO8k9QRww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0oO8k9QRww)
* **Screenshot of Read Aloud screen reader** (will upload a video if requested): [https://snipboard.io/eyiT3x.jpg](https://snipboard.io/eyiT3x.jpg)
* **Testing responsiveness**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS\_uXIl-rlE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS_uXIl-rlE)

**Features:**

* A dynamically generated menu bar and table of contents for each ""section"" of the book.
* A simple but functional search feature to help navigate the content.
* The ability to bookmark specific headers for easy reference later.

# Pros:

1. **Accessibility:** A single HTML file works on nearly any device with a web browser, no installation or specific software required.
2. **Offline Functionality:** Players and GMs can download the file and use it entirely offline.
3. **Interactive Features:** Search, bookmarks, and dynamic menus make navigating the content much easier than flipping through pages.
4. **Customizability:** It’s easy to include thematic fonts, colors, and styles without relying on external files.
5. **Portability:** One file is simple to share and store compared to folders with multiple assets.
6. **Cost-Effective:** No need to print or rely on expensive PDF formatting tools AND you can add your own content using just basic knowledge of html.
7. **Responsive Design:** Can be designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices seamlessly.

# Cons:

1. **Learning Curve:** Designing a functional and visually appealing HTML TTRPG requires some coding knowledge.
2. **Graphic Limitations:** Inline images and styles can bloat the file or limit its visual fidelity compared to professional PDFs or printed books.
3. **Compatibility Issues:** While most modern browsers handle single-file HTML well, older or less common ones might struggle.
4. **File Size:** Embedding all assets (images, fonts, etc.) directly into the HTML can result in a large file size.
5. **Perceived Simplicity:** Some might view it as 'less professional' compared to traditional publishing formats like printed books or polished PDFs.
6. **Limited Security:** HTML is inherently editable, which might make creators hesitant to distribute without risk of unauthorized modifications.

What do you think of this approach? Could this be a viable format for TTRPGs in the future, or are traditional methods still the way to go? I'd love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or critiques!",rpg,1735503291.0,0,3361,478
1366,108,1dkof6y,Looking for a new Heroic High Fantasy TTRPG for my group!,"Hey everyone! I really need some help finding a new system for my group. We recently finished a Pathfinder 2e campaign (that lasted a year and a half), which was our second one after running through a D&D 5e campaign (another 2 year long campaign).

D&D 5e is not an option since it was a nightmare to make it interesting past level 12 considering how crazy some spells were, not to mention that building encounters felt like a terrible chore. The whole rulings vs. rules also felt a bit like a copout thing to keep the book from supporting me as a GM. And I don't even want to get started on how confusing the wordings are, so much so that it need the Sage Advice and Crawford to chime in whenever the rules failed to be clear.

Pathfinder 2e was the polar opposite, there's a rule for everything, which is great, but also ... there's a rule for everything. It was very hard to adjudicate something in the spur of the moment because that would likely step on the toes of a specific feat somewhere. Player's never felt completely comfortable with their classes and all they could do, specially my casters who felt like they were always playing 5D chess, compared to everyone else. Another thing they did mention is that they never got to feel properly powerful even though I was very generous with Trivial encounters (exactly with that purpose in mind). They didn't love the fact that whenever combat started everyone needed to bring their A game, put in tons of effort and play off of each other to tiring extent in order to come out on top, or otherwise they would struggle.

So we set out to look for a different system, that can be a good middle ground. Here are some of the things we tried:

* **Dragonbane:** They loved the roll under mechanics, and the skill based progression (no levels). They didn't like how gritty it felt.
* **Savage Worlds:** It was pulpy, but oh boy none of us were a fan of the resolution mechanics. It wasn't very fast either, but again they loved the advancement system. It made them feel like they slowly progress toward their goals as an adventurer.
* **Legend in the Mist:** Using the Tinderbox, plus the Otherscape rules which I own, we played for half a dozen games. They loved the cinematic feel, but the looseness of the rules were a bit of a turn off. They like rules that are a tad meatier than what it has to offer (so it's likely that no PbtA will suffise since City of Mist, Otherscape and Legend in the Mist are on the far end of crunchiness for PbtAs).
* **Daggerheart:** The vibe is there! However, the resolution mechanic was a flop for the group, and the card gimmick was really annoying to navigate. It being level based also was not great. But we enjoyed the tools for exploration, the Experiences, the more cinematic flow of combat, etc.

Here are also some of the things we looked into:

* **Conan 2D20 & Cohors Cthulhu:** They love Achtung! Cthulhu. They love the flexibility of Truths, and how Momentum feels awesome, so I read through Conan and Cohors, and the tone is not quite there. A bit too gritty and the lack of fantasy ancestries is an issue.
* **BRP (Runequest & Mythras):** We haven't tested it yet, thought I have DMed Call of Cthulhu for years so I'm somewhat familiar with the D100 system. If it's anything like CoC I'm afraid it'll be too dangerous and punishing for them, but we'll try it even though the tone is way off for what we want (too bronze-age-y and retro-dnd for our liking).
* **Warhammer Fantasy:** Another D100 system that was suggested. It felt too gritty as well, but we're definitely giving it a shot too. (Nefver know until we try it).

Moreover, these are the things we are looking for in a game:

* Heroic High Fantasy tone; they want to fight dragons, brave jungles with crazy liches and weird ziggurats, uncover magical artefacts, shove their foot in the face of villains, without caring too much with the ""survival"" aspect of things, or how brutal they are (which likely excludes Forbidden Lands too).
* Challenges; Not wanting something brutal doesn't mean they want everything to be easy. They just don't want everything to be a fight for survival, like their lives are always on the line and any small mistake will cost them their character. (So probably OSR is not the right path).
* Simple and flexible resolution system; They loved rolling under mechanics, they also enjoy dice pools, but we are all tired of the D20+mod vs. DC variants out there. They love how Truths in the 2D20 system make the game feel flexible since they like to think out of the box for a lot of things.
* Magic; This is a big one. Something with a good balance between powerful and flexible but that doesn't outright negate everything or undermines martials. (Also why The One Ring didn't appeal to them, the lack of magic wielding options was a turn off)
* Setting agnostic; They enjoy playing in the Realms, Greyhawk, Eberron, Exandria, Golarion, and the likes. So having a system that can be lifted from its setting and placed in any of those would be great.

I know this is super freaking specific, and it is likely that there's no game out there that ticks all boxes, but in all honesty I don't know what I don't know, so before giving up and getting whatever's closer and adapting it I thought I'd turn to the community who might know of just the thing.

  
**TLDR;** Group with a very specific thing in mind, tried a lot of systems for heroic fantasy and still hasn't found the right game. If you could reccomend something you think would fit, and tell me why you'd think so it would be greatly appreciated!

**EDIT:** Thank you all for the help. I have read through the all Quickstarts, previews, and blog posts (and the actual book whenever it was something I had in my collection) that you all pointed me too, and I think I might have found just the game for my group: **Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Soulbound**.
The system is nearly everything I wanted. I mentioned it to two of my players and they’re actually super pumped after reading a bit about it.

1370,112,1h2tn54,I didn't think that being an RPG designer would mean asking my parents to microwave a dandelion.,"I make games. Sometimes they're [dice-rolling fantasy things](https://a-smouldering-lighthouse.itch.io/faewater). Sometimes they're... stranger than that. 

Last month, I designed a game where [everyone makes dandelion crowns](https://a-smouldering-lighthouse.itch.io/dandelions) and mourns a lost friend named Jessie. The flower crowns are real; Jessie is not. The flowers you find and the process of weaving the crown shape your conversation about her, and the kind of person she was.

Because the game is a kind of eulogy, I wanted the design to be a collage. Memories of a person often feel like little cuttings from their life, reassembled into a story. I rummaged around the Internet finding public domain dandelion art, stock photos, paper textures. There was one thing I couldn't find online: a (free) photo of a pressed dandelion, meant to look like it was pressed between the pages. Once I latched onto that idea, I really wanted it! So I slipped on a backpack and went walking.

Unfortunately for my goofy ass, it was October in Canada, so I couldn't find a dandelion in bloom. I did manage to snag some that had gone to seed, which were useful on their own. But no luck on the little yellow pieces of sunshine.

The next day, I was talking to my parents over the phone, complaining about my dandelion woes. To my surprise, my mom said ""I think I saw one in our garden!"" and dashed outside. A minute later, she was back on the phone, triumphant. She found a dandelion!

But I needed a *pressed* dandelion... and since the game was going online soon, we were short on time for the slow process of preserving flowers. I was not without my tricks, though. Did you know that, in a pinch, you can microwave flowers to get a quick-dry that's almost as good as a few weeks between books?

I'm sure you can see where this goes. Which of the following steps do you think was hard to explain over the phone to two seventy year-olds?

1. Place the dandelion between two kitchen towels.
2. Place a flat piece of glassware (a food storage container, a glass pie plate) on top of the towels.
3. *Set the microwave to 50% power.*
4. Microwave for 2 minutes.

If I was a betting man, I'd guess you just said number 3. Here's how the conversation actually went:

1. Why a kitchen towel! Does it have to be a kitchen towel? We have paper towels. What do you mean ""between""? Face down or face up? We'll use the paper towels. Why a kitchen towel?
2. How do I put the glass on top? What do you mean ""glassware""? It's too heavy. It's too light! I don't know if we missed the dandelion. Does it just sit there?
3. We know how to set the microwave to 50% power! My goodness, who doesn't know how to do that? You don't need to explain everything.
4. TWO MINUTES! It's going to burn. We're going to burn the dandelion! Two minutes? Oh no. It needs to be less, I think. Oh dear.

Two minutes later, I had one picture of a pressed, yellow dandelion.

Two months later, I was very lucky to [receive an award](https://www.goldencobra.org/2024winners.html) from the judges of the Golden Cobra Challenge for *A Crown of Dandelions.*

I do feel a *little* imposter syndrome -- they couldn't exactly play it during judging, November in New Jersey -- but I am very grateful for the nod. And also to my parents, for finding a little yellow dandelion and trusting my microwave instructions.

You want to do everything you can to make sure that isn't a waste, isn't a disappointment, and so you end up spending even more time trying to up your success rate only for player problems, scheduling/irl issues, or you just having a brain fart/not feeling it on the day to potentially ruin things anyway. I can understand the feelings that lead to the fixation, (pardon the overstatement but I'm a sucker for alliteration), but I do wish I knew how to convince people to take things a little less seriously sometimes.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, it's OK to relax and just let yourself be a bad, or at least mediocre gm every now and then. Heck, its fine to do that most of the time if you still enjoy running games that way. Are you having fun most of the time? Are your players having fun most of the time? Then why does it matter? If someone calls you a bad gm, after they're disappointed with a session you put a solid amount of effort in and any they put in was to the detriment of everyone else at the table, well... maybe they're right. But you don't need to be a good gm. ",rpg,1716295101.0,0,2169,412

1377,119,1fmb44v,The Players Paradox: Wanting to Play but Not Wanting to Learn,"So I was wondering if this topic had been addressed in specific terms. 
Essentially what the title says, players wanting to play a ttrpg but very unwilling to learn the rules beyond “roll dice to overcome check.” 
I call this the Players Paradox since this mindset contradicts itself to the very nature of the hobby to a decent degree. What I’ve encountered in my time as a DM is players who absolutely want to play a galavanting adventure or in-depth story with memorable characters and moments but find the rules that aid in this endeavor to stifle their pursuit of collective storytelling and emergent gameplay. 
Often times, it would be things like not remembering how spells work or forgetting an integral character’s ability that they chose. 
To further complicate this, I’ve tried using different systems that would appeal to their needs but would encounter the same issues as well a new concern that the game was not as engaging or “simple” for them. It became a situation where they disliked the current rules and wanted them changed to where they didn’t need to remember anything beyond a modifier but didn’t want anything new nor wanted to feel the same as other characters. 

In addition, I’ve personally experienced a strange issue that is counter to what most D&D videos and posts pose where I have had many players who want to be railroaded with curated experiences and abhor anything that isn’t just constant success. I count this as part of the players paradox as they want stakes and drama but without any chance of failure or at least failure that is to the immediate detriment of their character. 

I’ve asked some players about this and they have said that they’re coming to the game to have a story be told while playing “D&D.” They have said they want a Skyrim/Dragon Age/The Witcher/Baldur’s Gatr-vibe where they’re seeking content out to riff and have fun with each other. 

To grant context, I’ve played 5e, Index Card RPG, Dragonbane, and various story games with these groups. I have also expressed my side of this to my players stating that I can’t help provide decent scenarios without them knowing what their characters can do. Some players took this well while others vehemently got repulsed by the concept of learning their character and fully abandoned that character or group simply because they were asked to not shift the responsibility onto the DM. On the players that stayed but were repulsed by this idea, they expressed that they didn’t want to get anything wrong and thought that dropping their current character for a simpler one was better. I did reach out to a player who dropped and they did say that learning any rules at all that weren’t immediately understood or on the page was not fun for them and while they liked playing with others, learning enough to understand their character was not worth it. 

I have DM’d for 12 years now and this has been very consistent among my players, even in games where rules were lite or failure was used as “success at cost.”

So I pose this post to ask the wider /rpg community if you’ve also dealt with this concern amongst your player base and how you addressed it?",rpg,1726947706.0,0,3154,547

The problem is that this had led to situations where I feel like I can't fully enjoy or play games like Rogue Trader or other older games because I need a print copy of the book, and of course lots of out of print stuff is expensive.

1388,130,1g9p01s,DMing for players that have DMing experience feels so much better,"I have been DMing since last year after being a player for 2 years. I first DM'd a few one-shots for a group of friends and colleagues that I had been a player as a trial. Since we knew each other, the group dynamics was amazing. They loved the plots and combats and it gave me so much confidence to keep it up.

Then I moved to another city so I had to depart with the friend group. I craved for more DMing so I thought ""hmm I think I am truly in love with DnD now, might as well get more players into it"".

I then went on looking for group discords and DM'd a few offline one shots for the strangers. For the ""promotional"" purpose, I prioritized new players that are interested in getting into the game.

Although they seemed nice and motivated in the messages, I found that many of them had a hard time to ""respect"" the whole thing after playing with them. No, I don't mind if they do anything funny in game or lose interest if I don't do well. Hell, I was a new player once, I knew what it was like. But they either didn't even care to read, or invest they time and energy in either playing or remembering the plots to make things better for everyone. They didn't even want to help me carrying the stuff or move the tables to set up. It felt like I was providing service for them for free. It was mentally exhausting and I almost lost the interest in DnD completely.

I vented that to that DM from that group of friends and colleagues. He told me I should get a group with DMs and experience players this time instead, coz they know things better.

Now I have been DMing for almost six months for this group of 5, 4 of them are DMs for other groups, the another one is a long term players since a kid. The difference is crazy. I got compliments and feedbacks after every session. We quickly form unspoken rules and know what each others is doing to push the game forward. They always come early to help me setting up and cooking. And we get to even talk about things other than DnD. Memes and inside jokes on discord nonstop. It's really refreshing that after a long time I finally felt ""DM are players too"" again. I feel not only respected but loved coz I think there are things that only DMs understand.

Sorry if it sounds a bit gatekeeping to newer players. It's more of a share of experience if someone feels frustrated with DMing. It's also something newer players could help the DM (and yourself) to have more fun. If you are a DM and feel the same way I felt before, if you can change how the players behave then sure, if you can't then maybe a different audience is what you need. If you are a newer player, please take care of your DM and try to be a good player as well.

Then you read ""add 1 per monster level"" or ""add 1 per dungeon level"" and it starts to make sense... you will no longer find copper and pottery... and you will start to have a chance at some big valuable stuff.

It has been some hours... you have climbed down a few times and felt tunnels slope downwards... you are about 5 stories down... and it is starting to feel like half the tunnels have some obstacle and half the caverns have monsters or dangerous hazards. But the walls... you start to see frequent gems pertruding from rocks, gold veins, ancient alien artifacts and saddly... the remains of past explorers and their gear.

1390,132,1ff87l0,Weird story: My game won an award. The award was tomatoes.,"Here's the story of the strangest\* thing to happen to me since I started making games.

❁❁❁

I love local conventions. I love that they’re universally bizarre and idiosyncratic, with traditions and cultures and venues that are all the product of their specific place and time. Please, give me a website that could have been made in 2004. Give me weird games run by weird people. Give me a church basement.

My most-local convention is called Cangames. It’s been running for 47 years. There are board games, RPGs, war games, and artisans peddling nerdy crafts. Every year, I stare at the elaborate foam constructions made by ancient men, who stand around their toy soldiers with rulers in hand.

This year, I was running my game [*Sock Puppets*](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/refling/sock-puppets?utm_source=Kurt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=can-i-offer-you-some-crying-no-just-a-cherry)*.*

*Sock Puppets* is… somewhat of a spectacle. The first half hour is spent casually chatting as you all make puppets from paper bags.

[`(Here's a picture of a toothy monstrosity I made that weekend.)`](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/c2b65048-d132-4acf-b4b9-eecc5949d6c0.png?w=960&fit=max)

The next hour is spent hissing passive aggressively at each other as you play out a failing children’s television show. What this means is that, for the first time ever, ancient men with rulers were staring at *me*.

One man (not ancient) approached me wearing a convention t-shirt. He asked me if I was going to be at the con on Sunday. I put down my puppet and said, “Maybe! What’s up?” And he said, with a cryptic smile, “There are awards”.

So I went to the con on Sunday.

I walked up to the front desk. I said, “Hey, I heard there are… awards?” The man at the desk confirmed. I asked when the awards were, and was told there wouldn’t be a ceremony since the man who used to run it retired. Fair enough. I said, “I might have won an award.”

The man at the desk said, “What makes you think you won an award?” This was a very cool and innovative way to trigger my imposter syndrome.

I said, “A man in a convention shirt walked up to me and said that… there are awards.”

The man at the desk said, “Oh, who was it?”

There is no way to know how much time passed as I stood processing that question. Stars were born and died, probably.

I said, “I don’t know.”

The man at the desk said, “Hmm. Maybe Todd.”

But Todd was not there. So left and returned later.

Someone new was at the desk. This time, I knew what was happening, and I had a tidy little speech. I said, “Hello. It is possible that I may have won an award. A man walked by me yesterday and said awards exist. He was wearing a fancy t-shirt. His name could be Todd.”

The person behind the desk said, “What was the award for?”

This was another question that left me slack-jawed like the puppets that brought me there. Working together, we determined that the only possible answer was, “Best Addition to an RPG”. (There is no “Best RPG”.) I would later learn that my competition was a game with dice made of sugar cubes.

But the award was not there (and neither was Todd), so off I went again.

At this point, I got a text from the con’s RPG organizer: I had indeed won the award. So I showed up later that night and claimed my prize: an adorable, extremely campy plaque with a dwarf on it.

[`(This is the plaque. A dwarf jumping out of a phoenix egg. Are dwarves birds?)`](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/00d5e080-424f-425d-9a6e-1838d429d07b.png?w=960&fit=max)

But that was not all I had in store for me. The two RPG people now behind the desk (thank you, Kevin and Jason) looked at each other and smiled. Kevin said, “You need your tomato!”

I said, “What?” as he pulled an entire tomato sapling from behind the front desk.

He passed me the plant and said, “We have extra!” like that explained everything.

I said, “What?” again.

He shrugged and said, “Local con!” like that explained everything. Which in some ways, it did.

[`(Anyway, here is my tomato plant. It's grown little yellow tomatoes.)`](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/507d46b2-652e-4580-a3f5-40b667b8dd98.png?w=960&fit=max)

1393,135,1hqih0j,You aren't comfortable roleplaying.,"[[EDIT:addendum to title

You aren't comfortable acting, but that's what you came here expecting your roleplay to be.]]

Hey, 
This is sort of a PSA that i'm sure exists somewhere else but I've run into it a lot recently. I'm a sort of forever DM and play a lot of systems because I love the variety. I also try to get new people to play and when they come to the table they aren't comfortable roleplaying(or acting more specifically) but still want to play their character in a narrative way.
This is important because I reward ""roleplay,"" so if you have a DM like that this might help.


Charisma is obviously the most common check. If you don't want to RP, I let a player explain what the goal of their words or actions.
Example:

Player: ""I want to convince him to give us a better deal on these items.""

DM: ""Alright, explain it to me, how or what is the main point of your characters effort.""

Player: ""My character explains that if we can use these items we will do better on our next mission and will reward him with more than we can right now.""

DM: ""Alright, that makes sense roll for it with advantage.""

Then i'll go back to doing my voices for my npc because if I do it even when they don't, maybe it will help them over time, especially if they see silly characters.

I know it's not much on appearance, but just having them take that extra bit of information to think about it and narrate  a bit has helped some of my players get a little more into Roleplay without so much discomfort. 

P.S.

Fun-employment is also a great game to practice RP antics. 

Edit:

I wrote a long response to someone, and I am realizing now ""roleplaying,"" was too general a term. My sincerest apologies.

Voices are not required, nor do I look for players doing voices. This is for the people who come to the table expecting to act like characters in podcasts they listen to.

I meant this for those people who like to do a voice or persona themselves to embody their characters. I meant this as a way to start getting them to their own expectations, and yes I do enjoy doing voices and it does seem to help some less comfortable people want to join in because I am not Voice actor.

What I actually consider RP is using the function of a player characters knowledge, logic, actions, and intent for goals and scenes. Like many of the examples given in the comments. 

But I also do like voices, as do most of my players for their own characters. But that is a tiny part of our immersion, not the actual RP. 

Edit 2: An addendum to the title. I've have seen the error of my ways.

1394,136,1blv76s,"I am so damn upset, so I have to rant.","I am beyond infuriated at this moment, and I just really need to vent.  
I have a group of friends, and I will alter the names for everybody, so here we have the group: Me, Kim, Rasmus, David & Jonathan.  
Together, we have all been playing Traveller for about 1.5 years. That scenario finally came to an end, so now we moved over to a new game master, that would be Kim. I am always the GM in any game, so I am beyond excited to be a player for this.

  
We are going to be playing ""Things from the Flood"" (Tales from the Loop). I already had the rulebooks, as did Kim. We all wrote in the WhatsApp group and voted on a date, that date would be today, on the 23rd. A Google Calendar invite is sent out to everybody, and **everybody** RSVPs with a yes.

  
During this period, I am just studying the rulebook and trying to get a ""feel"" for the game.  
I am used to classic dungeon crawling TTRPGs as well as Sci-Fi RPGs such as Traveller. I have also delved into horror, such as Call of Cthulhu, but I have never played a Year Zero Engine game or anything like Things from the Flood. This looked very interesting.

  
During this time, Kim is also studying the rulebook.

  
On the 23rd, everybody is just going to sit down at my place and create characters together. Very similar to Traveller in the sense that everybody should be present for a character creation event, and that it shouldn't be done solo by somebody else.

  
So, three days ago, David says he has to decline attending. ""It turns out that I forgot my birthday. I am so sorry, guys. Would you be OK if I created a character with you before the first session starts?""  
We all unanimously agree that this is okay.

  
Today is the day. I help Kim by printing out character sheets and reference sheets. I spent 2 hours cleaning my apartment with my husband since we are having guests. I go to the store and buy snacks and drinks for everybody, since I am the host, I think I should provide some kind of food and beverage.

  
One hour before we are about to start, Jonathan is JUST ABOUT to step on the bus that takes him to the city I live in when we receive a text in the WhatsApp group from Rasmus.

  
""Hey guys, I am so sorry, I completely forgot about today. I have turned off notifications on my phone for the past two days, and I didn't get any reminders. Sorry. But I will be unable to attend since I have other things planned now. Best of luck today!""

  
So, Jonathan writes then; ""Is there any point for me to come over?"" I reply with, ""No. Don't come, go home.""  
I call Kim, who is currently at a birthday party with his kids, and inform him of what has happened. He is infuriated and says he still wishes to see me to hang out.  
I reply that I am currently way too angry to meet anybody right now, and that I just want to be left alone, since I think this is so unbelievably disrespectful.

  
We have Google Calendar reminders, we have a WhatsApp group, and still, this somehow happened. And, it is important to point out that we are all in our 30s, so finding time for this is rather hard, and we have to move things around to make it work.

  
Kim's wife was luckily at home, so they had not arranged a babysitter.

  
Another clarification: This is not the first time, but the third time in a row that Rasmus bails on us last minute. But it has never been 1 hour before the game.

This week, we tried the Avatar game. I read the quickstart and mostly understood the rules, but my understanding of PbtA games is that they are heavily reliant on player agency and players understanding the mechanics and their options, and none of my players came prepared.

Partially due to my inexperience and partially due to that of my players, I ran an entire session of Avatar without any balance actions or combat (lack of combat was largely on them, but I could have found opportunities to force it; maybe I should have interpreted more of their social roleplay as balance actions?). It was all basic actions/skill checks. With very minor modifiers, this basically means the whole session was basically just coin flips to see if an action succeeded.

And my players seemed to love it! They still got to interact with characters, make crazy plans that took dumb risks that somehow worked out, and act out fun characters.",rpg,1712812046.0,0,996,169

Never even wanted to look at another system. Not even another TSR product. SO many great games I missed out on because of stubborness.

Then I went to college and found a new gaming group. They were moving from AD&D to Call of Cthulhu.  Well, I didn't want to. Why mess with perfection? But my choice was to either play CoC or not play with my friends.

I actually planned to sabotage the game so we could get back to AD&D. But I REALLY liked CoC. I figured by session 3, I could do something to derail the whole thing and then we could get back to the far superior AD&D. Problem is, by the end of session 2, I was hooked enough to buy the CoC hardback.

1397,139,1i8tst9,"Why are new TTRPG players often so averse to playing ""normal"" characters?","I've been roleplaying for years, since my days in World of Warcraft, and this isn’t a new trend, but it’s something I’ve noticed too in TTRPGs. For the past year, I’ve been part of a local RPG association in my neighbourhood, playing regularly with people who are completely new to tabletop RPGs. It’s great to see their enthusiasm and creativity, they’re excited to roleplay and to create deep, meaningful characters. But one recurring issue is that many seem to avoid respecting even the basic norms of a setting in their pursuit of originality.

For example, in a Cyberpunk game, someone might create a character who refuses to use cyberware because ""being 100% human is cooler."" Or in a D&D game, I’ve seen a bard who doesn’t do music or even the idea of entertainment. While I don’t prohibit anyone from making what they want (roleplaying games are about fun, after all!) I do find myself wishing for more cohesion with the setting sometimes. When every character tries to be ""the exception,"" it can undermine the tone of the world or the group dynamic.

This isn’t just a new player thing, though. I’ve seen it happen with more experienced players, too, especially those who have spent years playing and feel the need to push boundaries. That said, I’ve noticed that over time, many veteran players tend to accept the canon and embrace archetypes, realizing that originality comes from how you roleplay, not necessarily what you play. A bard who loves music doesn’t have to be boring,what makes them unique is their personality, their backstory, and how they interact with the world.

So, why is there such an aversion to ""normal"" or canon-compliant characters? Is it the influence of social media, where unconventional characters are often showcased? Is it a lack of confidence, where players feel they need to stand out from the start to leave an impression? Or is it simply a misunderstanding of how settings are structured and why those structures exist?

For GMs and players: How do you approach this balance? How do you encourage creativity while still fostering respect for the setting’s canon? Have you also noticed this tendency in your groups, and how do you handle it?

To be clear, I’m not saying everyone must stick rigidly to archetypes or settings. But sometimes, playing a character who fits into the world as it can lead to more interesting stories and dynamics than trying to stand apart from it.

I’d love to hear your thoughts!

Edit: added more context

Edit 2: To give some context, in the Cyberpunk game I mentioned, one of my players made a character with absolutely zero cyberware, not even basic implants. In that world, where even the poorest people often have at least some level of cybernetic enhancement, being entirely ""natural"" is extremely rare. It’s an interesting concept, but it feels like they jumped straight to that archetype without considering other kinds of characters that could have cyberware while still being unique. I don’t stop them, of course, I want everyone to have fun, but it does feel like they’re skipping over a lot of what makes the setting rich and unique in the first place.

Similarly, with the bard example, I had someone create a bard but strip away so much of what defines that class that it didn’t really feel like a bard anymore. They didn’t play music, weren’t into performance, and their whole vibe leaned more toward being a rogue, but they still insisted on calling themselves a bard because they wanted to be ""a weird bard."" It’s not that I mind them tweaking the concept, but when it gets to the point that it feels like they’re playing a completely different class, I start to wonder if they’d have more fun just leaning into what they really want to play.

I totally get wanting to subvert expectations or stand out, I’m not against it at all! But I think the fun of breaking tropes works best when you’ve first taken a moment to understand the setting or the archetype you’re working with. When you throw yourself into it with no grounding, it can sometimes feel like there’s less cohesion in the group or the world.",rpg,1737720078.0,0,4096,706

We are all pretty devastated. One game they were supposed to be in just started. The GM is continuing the campaign and decided to keep their slot unfilled as a measure of respect. My campaign has been going for over a year and coming up on its 20th session. We have a lot of gas left in the tank but I feel weird continuing.

The only thing that's made it a bit of a harder sell for some was the assumed Grimdark Fantasy setting that, while could be easily set-dressing'd out, did set a tone and expectation that was less heroic and more blood, guts, and depravity focused.

At my table we've been playing with the playtest of Shadow of the Weird Wizard, the less grimdark, sort of second edition of the game, and apparently it's actually hit release recently, much to the surprise of me and my playgroup.

He is absolutely right, and there is historical evidence for it.

In winter and spring 1997, D&D publisher TSR couldn’t publish any new products because of outstanding debts to their printer. In that lull, distributors reported huge increases in sales of other games. SHADOWRUN sales increased 20% during that time. Palladium sales went up as well. It seems like people have money they want to spend on TTRPGs, and when they can’t spend it on D&D, that money goes to other TTRPG publishers. So Hall has historical backing for his idea.

1402,144,1j6vgn3,Bubblegumshoe gives me something I never knew I was missing in other ttrpgs: I always feel like I am playing a game.,"I've been a player in a bubblegumshoe campaign for nine sessions so far, and although I was neutral on the idea of the system before we started (I don't actually like the teen mystery genre), after trying it, this might be my favorite system I have played so far.

One thing I love is the social skills. Rping with friends is always a lot of fun, but there often isn't much mechanical tension in the social gameplay of systems we've done. The game stops, and we act with an occasional dice roll to see if something worked. In bubblegumshoe, you have limited points in each skill, and they don't refresh until the adventure ends. So I am constantly thinking, ""Is this the time to use a point in gossip? I might be able to build an advantage for later in the mystery... but I might need it later; what if the PERFECT opportunity to burn a point comes up and I don't have one!"". It brings the resource management I usually associate with combat or dungeon crawls to social interaction, and I LOVE that.

Relationships are another thing I have found mindblowing in this game; I have often run into the probs in games, both as a dm and a player, where the group befriends some powerful person who can help them out. However, how MUCH they can help is always an issue; as players, can we ask them to solve all our problems? How often can we do that before they get annoyed? And as a GM, the same thing from the other side; I don't want my players to get an NPC to solve everything, but how much should they be able to help? Relationship points are fantastic because they show precisely how much goodwill an NPC has for a player and how often the player can draw on their connection with them. It means the GM and player know how this relationship works, what the NPC will do for the player, and how it will go. They can play around it! (like in my game, my pc has a friend who is a hacker. I started with a ton of relationship points with her, but if I asked her to solve everything for us, she would get tired of us, and I would have to spend game time rebuilding that relationship. A GM could always SAY that, but having the exact number helps decision-making and brings the GAME into it, you know?)

My favorite part is combat; namely it solves an issue I've had with a lot of systems, that a lot of the combats don't matter. The only consequence of a failed combat in many systems is the death of the pc, and a lot of the time (unless it is something like an osr game), the gm will not WANT a pc to die to some random mook. So we are rolling dice, but we all know the chance that we LOSE is tiny. However, with a bgs throwdown, there are real consequences to losing, but the consequences are something that ADDS to a PC's story, makes it more complicated, and opens up new avenues for both the pc and the GM. It isn't the end of the story in any way, so the GM will be much more willing to have all throwdown ACTUALLY losable.

Other systems I've played have had some similar things. Vampire: the Masquerade v5 has gotten the second closest to this feeling, but bubblegumshoe just fits the story and mechanics together so smoothly it is like nothing I've seen. Every mechanical decision feels like a story decision, and every story decision feels like a mechanical decision. I never feel like the game has stopped, and no encounter feels inconsequential. It is just a ton of fun!",rpg,1741480743.0,0,3377,636
1403,145,1crp8p6,TTRPGs require effort. ,"I had someone tell me that ttrpgs requiring effort isn't entirely true. It upset me because I've been in the hobby for near two decades, running as a  gm for a little over a decade (a relatively short amount of time), and I have never once thought that way. I felt dismissed and invalidated.

Before we even get to sit down and begin playing there's dedicated effort spent on getting the group together. 

First I find the people that are interested and can coordinate our schedules to sync up and play. Not a small task, especially if you're starting a new group.

Then I always do the optional sesh zero with anyone I haven't run a game for before. Being sensitive to stuff like domestic violence or sexual assault is important to me as ive seen first hand how hurtful it can be to impact someone that way. Explaining safety tools and setting expectations for behavior is key to finding the very simplest of common ground to build a foundation on.

Then I ask questions about the type of game we want to run/play together. Do we want episodic adventures or something more epic in scale lole lotr. Do the players want combat and loot to be the focus or just when narratively fitting? Is setting important? What about handwaiving resources or survival mechanics? Is there plot armor for our furry critter friends? Then I find system that fits into the style of game we're looking for. 

Do I own a module that fits within the groups preferences or do I need to write it from the ground up(hours of effort to days of effort)? Do I need to edit it to fit the group? Yes. Do I need to re-edit it day of because someone can't make it? Maybe...

Let's say you're just a player though.

You still need to put in effort to sync up a schedule and dedicate the time to show up and be present. Are you bringing snacks or drinks, do you need to travel? Are you the host because that can be a buttload of work before, during, and after the sesh.

Have you or are you going to read the rules? 
Take notes? Do you need roll up your own character or use a premade? Do you need to buy a mini or dice? 

On average my players are playing for 2.5 to 4hr sessions which is time they're investing that could be spent doing something else. As a working adult, that supply of freetime only ever seems to get smaller and smaller every year. 

I want to show my players respect by putting together an experience for them they'll find fun. Each session is a gift I carefully craft to varying degrees of success. I want my players to know I value their time and commitment and I show that by putting in effort into my games.

You are investing effort all along the way of getting together to play...and more often than not some amount of $$ too.

I haven't even talked about actually playing any system yet but I've made a multiparagraph rant post about it... sure some systems require less effort to run/play...but all systems do require effort.

1404,146,1iiatu2,Solo roleplaying makes me a better GM and player,"Solo roleplaying is doomed to be underated forever and this is a vain attempt to convince you to try it. We need more solo roleplaying. Because once it clicks, it's an incredible experience.

All my solo games use Mythic Game Master Emulator 2e, that works as a ""GM"" while you play a normal TTRPG. I always make a *troupe* of characters, not a just a single one. There are other solo games that are standalone, others use a single character, but I know little about that stuff. The way I play, the experience carries over to playing with other people better.

### Learn how to GM

I will not offer to GM a game I didn't play solo. It's too valuable as a practice and I feel uncomfortable if I don't have it.

You can take your time. It's just you, no one is hurrying you. So you can slowly figure out how to interpret a roll and improvise from that prompt, review the rules of the game and figure out how things work, try different things...

Mythic relies on your expectation, on your idea of how a game about X usually goes. So you develop a strong sense of what a game is about, that allows you to more easily come up with stuff on the fly. I can GM a Star Trek Adventure because I played a couple of those, I put my years watching episodes into practice, so I have an ingrained structure in my mind. I know how star *treks*.

It also throws random events and weird twists to your expectations. So you practice how to answer unexpected situations or add those twists yourself. The idea you had for this adventure is suddenly cut in half, something unexpected appears, you got bored and went off the rails... and you learn how to take that feedback.

I notice how I developed a sense of how time flows during an RPG session. I know how much it takes to get through X amount of content. And how characters might flow and move through an adventure. Both mechanically and narratively. How much HP they tend to have after some fights, and how pissed off they tend to be.

You are wearing both hats: GM and players, at every point you see the game from both angles.

### Learn and test a system

No matter how much you memorize a book, you need to play a game to learn it. Only the experience of actually implementing the mechanic counts.

With solo roleplaying, you are testing the characters and the rules under a stressful and unpredictable environment. You aren't just theorycrafting. You play fights in the middle of a scenario and a story.

Some games have weird mechanics. Not everyone in my table will get a BitD, PbtA or FATE kind of game. So here is a chance to give an honest try to those weird systems. To see them in action and figure out what they are about. How they work in a story.

You will know your stuff because you played it. If someone asks a question, you will answer from experience.

### My first steps at homebrewing and ruling

Sometimes I hate the emphasis people give to homebrewing and ruling. Because it assumes GMs have to be game designers, sometimes even fix a game on the fly. Which is a rare talent that shouldn't be expected from all GMs.

Again, solo roleplaying is a safe place to practice all of this.

Make a ruling, roll the dice a couple of times, make another one and see how that one works. Come up with a new system, try it out for a couple of scenes or sessions. Tweak a character or rule... anything goes and you can always scratch and try again.

You will also develop a sense of *which* situations tend to require rulings or tweaks. And probably develop and test rulings that will cary over to your games. Here's an example:

> In Panic at the Dojo characters have three stances with different moves and playability. Enemies tend to have only one (Bosses several).
> There is an advancement system that adds new stances to PCs and enemies. I decided to scrap it. Because *I know* that keeping track of all that stances can be difficult for a player and for the GM.
> And I get to test the new advancement system I came up with, to see how satisfying it will be.

### Resources for GMing

I noticed that I'm less invested in what game the table chooses to play, because I can play my favourite game anyways. I'm more open to try different games, I don't mind much that some people only plays D&D. It made me more comfortable an the tables I play in.

And if I offer to GM a game, it will be a game where I have *hours* of solo experience. I will know the game intimately, which will make my offer more interesting and personalized for the people I'm playing it with.

I will be able to walk people through character creation better. Because not only I made several characters and NPCs, I played with them. I will run that first session more smoothly because I have a lot of practice with the rules.

I will have NPCs and adventure ideas that are already play tested. Probably even whole worlds and backstory.

And Mythic GME is an amazing tool for helping improvisation. Lots of good random tables, answer any question. Make a random event to spice things up...

### It's just fun

Admit it, you never played Lancer. You love it, but never had a chance of playing it.

Now you do. Play any game, with whatever characters you want, in an adventure about what interests you.

I will be the first one to say that Mythic and solo gaming in general takes some times to get used to. As I said, it's very DIY, and each of us has to develop a very personal style.

But once you get past that initial hurdle. It's amazing. The game takes a life of it's own. And it's a son of a bitch. Mythic is evil.

My final point is that solo roleplaying can be intense. Very moving emotionally. Many solo roleplayers will eventually have some story where they ended up crying.",rpg,1738764777.0,0,5702,1061

Back in 2008 to 2013, one of the main talking points during the *D&D* 3.X vs. *D&D* 4e edition war was that spellcasters were nowhere as strong in the latter game.

Since 2019, *Pathfinder* 2e has been facing a similar, smaller-scale edition war: the ""casters do not feel that strong"" critique. It is understandable, given that many people looking into *Pathfinder* 2e are coming from *Pathfinder* 1e and *D&D* 5e, where spellcasters can achieve spectacular, encounter-trivializing results.

* all ability rules copied from rulebook. (Further down for reference when needed)
* Organized between: Combat, Investigation, Social, and Miscellaneous Abilities. (So they didn’t have to sort through combat stuff when looking for social abilities and such)
* Health tracker

More often than not, when I see posts that are looking for a game with certain features I can't help but suggest Fabula Ultima because it satisfies so many needs at once. So, I thought I'd rather post my review of the game, ideally to convince you that this is in fact the game you are looking for (or not - I'll also go into that).

# Summary and recommendation

If anything, read this section. I'll go into further detail starting the next one.

**What does this game do?**

* Provide a strong framework to run fantasy games with a JRPG feel.
* Tell the tale of heroes-to-be, and larger-than-life villains, in an adventurous setting.
* Provide medium-crunch rules with a focus on narrative and interesting tactical choices.
* Provide streamlined rules for combat that gives you the feel of a JRPG during play.
* Provide interesting class choices, with a fun character creation where you can go wild making the character you wish.
* Provide consequences for failure, death being rare and player-driven.

**What does this game not do?**

* Tell stories about survival or with a sense of realism.
* Provide strong tactical rules for those oriented to tactical gaming, including grid-based combat. This game is theater-of-the-mind oriented.
* Provide extensive resource management. You just track Hit Points, Mind Points, and Inventory Points. Not even ammunition is tracked.
* Tell stories about villains, or about normal people - this game is about extraordinary people that will act heroically.
* Provide gritty gameplay with a true sense of looming death.

# Premise and Design Goals

Fabula Ultima is a game that tries to emulate JRPGs in a tabletop RPG format. For those of you who don't know what this means, think of Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Chrono Trigger, or games that are similar to these, you've most likely played them.

In the rare scenario that you still don't know what this means, it means the following:

* It is a game that provides the ability to play **medieval fantasy adventures**, or likewise, **adventures in settings usually supported by JRPGs** which can range from modern, to naturalistic, to futuristic, but all of them tied by **a group of heroes that fight the forces of evil**.
* As such, it needs to **emulate the relationships between characters** because JRPGs are also about the feelings each character has and how those relate to other characters.
* Battles need to support **interesting tactical choices**. In a JRPG you usually choose builds, strategize around a challenge, and execute your plan. Fabula Ultima needs to give PCs the ability to do this.
* On top of this, **combat scenes have to feel like a turn-based CRPG**, and this means you need to make a choice of what action you will perform, and to only track those things that matter. Ammunition, for example, is not tracked.

There are also other design goals for this game:

* It is a **medium light crunch game** most of the time (although this is subjective, we can argue it is squarely into medium crunch, but it is no crunchier than this).
* It is a **narrative, fiction-first, theater of the mind game**.
* It needs to be **flexible enough in terms of character creation** so that players can make choices to bring their wildest ideas into the game. JRPGs support a wide array of character and this game supports them very well.

As such, Fabula Ultima is a narrative game that aims to emulate JRPGs. It's an uncomplicated, very streamlined game that is perfect for those looking for heroic game alternatives.

Here's how this game achieves these goals.

# Setting

Fabula Ultima provides no standard setting. Instead, it encourages everyone to create their own settings. But the game doesn't leave you hanging there, it provides the following tools to create your world:

* The Eight Pillars: Eight tenets every setting must follow, to a greater or lesser extent.
* Three different setting styles: high fantasy, natural fantasy, techno fantasy. Each has their own vibe. The group is encouraged to create their own setting, and it's not mandatory to follow each strictly. But these are good guidelines to have an idea about the themes common to those settings.
   * Each setting style has their own splat book as well, with natural fantasy being released in English sometime next year. The other two have been released already.
* World creation guide: The game encourages the group to create a setting together by asking questions and drawing things in a map. There's nothing wrong with bringing your own world and skipping this section, but consider the following - Fabula Ultima can and will push you back if a player decides to use a Fabula Point (more on that later) to declare something you did not prepare for, this might very well undo your world building. In that scenario, remember that whatever you do not present the players is the same as that thing not existing.

# Core mechanics

Dice rolling is simple enough. Each character has four stats: Dexterity, Insight, Might, and Wisdom. Each is assigned a die rating from d6 to d12. A basic check has you pick two of these stats (can be repeated) and roll the corresponding dice, perhaps adding one or two numbers on top. This is exactly how Ryuutama plays, if it sounds familiar.

Multiple check types are rolled into this: basic checks vs a difficulty level, opposed checks, open checks, group checks, etc.

There are no ""skill lists"" similar to DnD. A ""skill check"" as in DnD is just a roll of two dice, the GM determines what is rolled in what situation. There's a list with examples of common checks in the book.

Certain checks can be done against a clock, in this case there's a series of rolls that need to be done to work towards some objective.

**Fabula Points (FP):** Characters have three *traits* that are words that describe this character: one describes how the character seems themselves, one describes the emotional theme of that character, and one describes their origin. On top of this, characters can have bonds with other characters, organizations, NPCs, etc. For these scenarios, players start the game with a stash of Fabula Points - if you have played Fate, this works very similarly. You can pay a FP to invoke a trait to reroll one or both dice; to invoke a bond and add its strength (number of emotions attached to it, max 3); or to declare a new story detail, a fact that must not override other previously declared facts.

Do note how this last point is what fights bringing your own world to the table. If you do, make sure to stay open to players declaring story details!

# Characters

Each character starts at level 5, and can grow up to level 50. For each level, a character will pick a level in a class, and then will pick a skill from that class or level up an existing skill that can be leveled up (also called *skill level* or SL).

On character creation, a player has to assign the initial 5 levels into two to three different classes. This means **players are forced to multiclass**, putting all your levels in a single class is forbidden. This however also means classes are bite-sized, each class only contains skills pertaining to that class. Mixing and matching classes is dead easy. Consider these restrictions:

* A class cannot have more than 10 levels assigned to it.
* A level 10 class is called ""mastered"".
* A character cannot have more than 3 non-mastered classes.

There are 15 classes in the core book you can pick from, and ~~10 more among all splat books, giving the sheer total of 25 classes~~ you can pick from to create the character you wish.

**EDIT:** I fumbled the class calculations. It's 15 from the core book, 11 from all splat books, and 2 extra classes. The grand total is 26 from the books, and 28 if you include the extra classes. Find them here in case you don't want to grab the splats just for the classes alone: [https://crystools.smug.cat/](https://crystools.smug.cat/)

# Equipment

A character has two hand slots (main and secondary), one armor slot, and one accessory slot. All characters can use most weapons, and some are martial weapons too which are usually more powerful. Even spellcasters can use arcane weapons to deal decent damage. Some equipment have different qualities that grant things such as elements or special effects to the weapons.

# Magic

Spellcasting is also not complicated. Certain skills grant you spells (you pick a spellcasting class, then you level up a skill that grants you a spell, then you pick a spell), and the spells have you spend mind points or MP (which is not for spells only, all classes have skills that make use of MP) which apply an effect, which can be offensive or not.

**Rituals:** Spellcasting classes can also cast rituals. Rituals, as complicated as they may sound, are simple. These are open-ended, non-combat effects characters can perform. They just require a simple check after the GM and the player have agreed on how this will look like. Powerful effects might require rare items before casting the ritual.

# Combat

Turns are *group turns*. Each party has a turn, then that turn is over and is then passed to the opposite party. Within each party, the GM or the players pick one character that has not yet acted during the round, that character does an action, and then passes the turn to the opposition.

Initiative uses the group check rules - players initiate a group check (one leader is chosen, everyone does the same check as the leader with DL 10, then the leader does the check with the bonuses granted by their teammates, which have their own initiative also added to the check) and compare the result with the highest initiative among enemies.

Offensive rolls, both attacks and spells, use a check that is compared vs the enemy's defense or magic defense as it corresponds. If successful, that player looks at the dice and picks the highest number among the dice, that's called the High Roll (HR). Then, the HR is added a number depending on the spell or the weapon, and that much damage is inflicted against the opponent, deducting the HP correspondingly.

Other actions that can be done are:

* Change your weapon by another one
* Spend Inventory Points to ""create"" items from your backpack and apply their effects
* Protect an ally from melee attacks
* Work towards an objective, filling a clock
* Hinder an enemy, causing them a status effect (slow, dazed, shaken, weak)
   * A status effect steps down a corresponding die. There are two more: enraged and poisoned which step down two dice, but these can only be caused by skill effects.
* Study a situation or an enemy
   * This is an open check vs fixed difficulties, you get as much info as your roll result
* Do something else not covered by the rules

One turn grants one action. Do note how there's no ""movement"" action: there are no distances tracked, and thus no grid and nowhere to ""move"" to.

Melee and ranged weapons mostly differ because the latter can be used against flying enemies, the former cannot. Other than that, they work the same.

**0 HP:** Upon hitting 0 HP, players are given a choice. You can either surrender or sacrifice yourself.

* Surrender: You no longer can fight in the scene. The GM decides your fate **which cannot be death**. You ""respawn"" in the next scene with half your HP (your ""Crisis"" score), and you undergo a consequence due to your failure.
* Sacrifice: If a villain is present on the scene, or if your sacrifice would benefit a character you have a bond towards, or if your sacrifice will make the world a better place (two of these must be true), you can choose to sacrifice. Your character dies, but also provides a crushing victory otherwise unattainable. Think of the fighter that deals single-handedly with a massive army, and wins, but at the cost of dying.
   * As such, revival rules are non-existent. You cannot revive a dead character.

# GM Guidance

GMs are provided plenty of guidance through the book. It is very well organized and provides multiple rules about how to journey across the land, how to create new character bonds, how to create NPCs, monsters, price of goods and services, providing rewards, etc.

NPCs are of most importance here. You are provided with three different ""tiers"" of enemies: soldiers, elites, champions. Elites replace two soldiers, and champions replace any number of soldiers. This determines their max HP, max MP, and number of skills they can have. NPCs follow most character rules (but not all, such as bonds). There's a small bestiary with NPC examples per species types, and extensive rules to create your own NPCs.

Villains are written extensively about. They are the dark side of the characters, their counterparts, and unlike other NPCs they have their own stash of meta-currencies, **Ultima Points (UP)**. These are not replenished ever if at all, and once a villain empties their UP pool, they either stop being a villain or escalate and become a next-tier villain (tiers are minor, major, supreme; these determine the scale of their goals).

# And beyond

There's more I have not written about. Projects, heroic skills, rewards, character growth, etc. I encourage you to give this game a try if you're interested. **Press Start** is a free supplement you can grab to give this game a test drive, so you know what you'll be dealing about.",rpg,1724524299.0,0,13325,2299
1417,159,1cx0fgb,Just had a disaster of a session,"I know there's not really much to discuss, I just wanted to vent a little.

I tried running a one-shot at a local game meetup tonight. At these events, typically a handful of people will offer to run indie RPGs and everyone else will join whichever game sounds most interesting. In the past there have been roughly 20 people to attend. My partner was accompanying me tonight, and 3 other people joined my game. Of the 3 others, one of them was great fun and really nice to talk to, but the other 2 people were quiet, passive-aggressive, and seemed thoroughly confused about the entire game. At times, I actually wondered if they even knew what an RPG was, which was mystifying since one of them insisted he had actually already played the game we were playing. They never involved themselves in any of the scenes, any time someone tried to get them involved they would just shrug and say ""I don't know"" or literally just stare at their character sheet and not respond. Any time I roped them into a scene they would actively try to remove themselves from it as quickly as possible. The story just ground to an absolute halt every single time it started to get moving.

We took a 10 minute break about halfway into the session, and I decided to just pull the plug. I told everyone I wasn't feeling it and me and my partner left. I apologized to her for even inviting her to this meetup because it went so badly. I've had tons of fun at previous meetups for this group, and I've talked up how great of a crowd it is to my partner, so for her first experience to go this badly made me feel even worse. She was understanding of course, but I feel bad nonetheless.

But the stories I hear about old school games all seem… more attached to their characters? Characters were long-term projects, carrying over between campaigns and between tables even. Your goal was to always make your character the best it can be. You didn’t make a level 1 character because someone new is joining, you played your level 5 power fantasy character with the magic items while the new guy is on his level 1.

1420,162,1cpiqdv,I just realized that I understand the D&D only crowd.,"I got into D&D back in the 6th grade in 1980. I couldn't actually afford to buy any D&D products till he Moldvay D&D boxed set came out. I didn't have anyone to play with on a regular basis. But I was really into it. My local hobby store sold other games: Traveller, Runeuqest, Top Secret, Gamma World, ICE games. But I didn't care. I only looked at D&D. I remember buying Dragon Magazine religiously, and completely skipping any article that was about something other than D&D. Back then, that wasn't a lot. I wasn't even interested in looking at another game.

I remember my brother bought Gamma World. I checkd it out and even played a game. But I dismissed it pretty quickly because it was not D&D.

Then I got to college. And I found a regular gaming group. We'd play once a week. and occasionally hang on weekends. Well, this group played LOTS of games. When I joined the group, we played AD&D. But we quickly switched to CoC, then Robotech, then GURPS. I was actually looking forward trying a new system after a campaign ended. Being forced to play new games by my group finally broke D&D's hold on me and let explore other systems.

Then I finished college and moved in with my wife. RPGs were not really on my mind and when I thought I would get into it, I walked into my local hobby store and saw an insane amount of 2E AD&D products and decided I was out. The insane amount of books scared me off.

Fast forward to the release of 5E. I was very interested. I bought the PHB within months of release. Sounded cool. I joined a game a few years later when my kids were older. I didn't want to go away for 4-6 hours a day, leaving my wife alone with a toddler and an infant.

I really wasn't having a good time. I felt things were too easy. I stuck with it for 2 years and then gracefully bowed out.

Now it's 2024, and I'm still interested in D&D. But I want to try new systems all the time. I wouldn't mind a 5E one-shot now and then. But I don't want to be in a multi-year campaign.

So, if you're a D&D-only guy, please stop limiting yourself. Find some online one-shot you can play and experiment a little. I used to be you 30-40 years ago. Now the world of RPGs is far more open to me.",rpg,1715437719.0,0,2198,422
1421,163,1imaxka,"On Crowdfunders and Failure, Relaunching WARDEN","Okay, so this happened. WARDEN's Crowdfunder (posted about it [Here](https://sh.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1if6n08/backerkit_warden_the_genreagnostic_d20_rpg/)) plummeted on day 5, and I decided to relaunch it today with a lowered Goal, revamped visuals and campaign stuff, cheaper base game and with freebies.

# [The New Campaign is here.](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/ghost-spark/warden-the-genre-agnostic-d20-rpg)

So, let's do a bit of a reflection, what did I do wrong on the first time? 

# Let's get real

There were a LOT of signs that I was doing something wrong, and that probably was visible to everyone, making the funding just not kick off.

So I think I'm going to go one by one through my mistakes, so you don't need to do the same mistakes as I do if you ever decide to run a campaign.

# Confidence in the product

I failed to create confidence in the product itself being effectively done. If you checked out the playtest document, you might have noticed that all the parts of the game are already written! But if you didn't, you were kind of left with my word on that. 

So, in the relaunch, I showed some preliminary bits of the layout I have done, and it also roughly shows what the book itself will look like when you get it to your hands. This is super important!

The layout also gives context to the art that already exists for the game, and helps people ease into what the game will roughly look like eventually.

# Too high a goal for funding

You know, looking from afar, asking 15k€ for a TTRPG sounds like a laughably small amount to ask. However, this robs the project from its context. Yes, there's currently a running Backerkit for the Legacy of Kain Mörk Borg hack that is doing ridiculous numbers. But that is a product with an existing fanbase. Two existing fanbases, in fact.

To me, the ""Funded in X minutes"" schtick is silly and kind of gauche. I didn't want to ""game"" the system so I could gloat about the speed of funding. I wanted the amount I ask to be realistic to the game I wanted to make.

However, this fails on two levels: 

First, I am not established enough. I am no John Harper or Tom Bloom, I don't have a fanbase to speak of who would help the project get to that amount. To be honest, Pathwarden, my best-selling game to date, hasn't actually accrued half of the amount I was asking! It's still very niche!

Second, I was thinking too big. I wanted WARDEN to be competitive with ""big boy games"" like Call of Cthulhu, Shadow of the Demon Lord, and yes, including Pathfinder 2e and D&D. This was the minimum I set for myself, which is quite unrealistic without outside funding or previous successes.

This underlines the biggest takeaway from this: **NO ONE WANTS TO PLEDGE FOR A FAILING PROJECT.** The game was dead on arrival because of this.

# Price point

After I launched Pathwarden, I felt like I set the price point for the game too low, as the game, even in PDF, is technically worth more. So WARDEN's PDF version cost twice the price of Pathwarden. This fails to take into account that generally, people balk at paying more than 20$ for a PDF. 

Do I think that is kinda unfair? Yes. But that's the established price point. As I went checking around the PDF price of many other trad games, I noticed they were all mostly in the same range, including Genesys and PF2, my two biggest inspirations for WARDEN. I somehow completely missed this fact as I did research.

So I lowered the price to 20€ for the PDF for the relaunch. It's simply the way to go.

# Being smart

If I was smarter, I would've used the tools I have to make contributing to the Backerkit more enticing. Especially if you're outside of my regular audience (which I do have, it's just very small). What is the tool in this case? Well, I do have a somewhat known game called Pathwarden, and slapping the PDF as a freebie basically doubles the worth of the PDF Pledge, without any extra overhead cost to me. 

It does hurt the future sales of that game, but getting this project out of the gate is way more important.

# Not enough visibility

So, a problem I had was that I made a project, without really contacting anyone in advance about publishing anything about it. I guess part of this is just not being established enough, meaning no one asks and no one cares, so I felt a whole lot of stress about it.

This time, I've already contacted a lot of people who might be able to help me carry this thing through.

# Bad timing

Launching a campaign on Backerkit during Zinequest is a silly, silly mistake to make. All eyes are on Kickstarter. Now, this is something I can't really fix (I cannot use Kickstarter due to country limitations), and this campaign was actually postponed for two months due to the holidays being a terrible time to run a Crowdfunder. 

I also didn't predict a massive recession, stock market drop, and a certain presidency also looming on the background, making people much less willing to spend money on silly elfgames. 

So in short, I just had really bad luck.

# Checklist

So, if you're like me and want to make a Crowdfunding project, here's a quick checklist to remember:

* **Confidence:** Build confidence in your product by showing what it looks like when finished, and by stating things clearly to show that you understand the scope of your project.
* **Scope:** Remember to keep the scope of your Crowdfunder realistic. You may overestimate the amount of funding you *actually* need to finish the game. This goes double if you plan on doing boxed sets and physical goodies (I avoided these for a good reason!).
* **Money:** Study the price points of other projects and products, and try to think about a realistic ratio of funding with the current reach that you have.
* **Worth:** Make the pledging worth it by giving a good deal, it's best to do this with previous products if you have any to give out, or maybe some extras you're planning on doing anyway. Remember that digital goods are free to give out!
* **Goal:** You want to make a project that can get funded fast. Cut scope as necessary! No need to speedrun the funding itself, but if it languishes too early, people will stop supporting it! Remember, no one wants to pledge for a dying product, even though the money doesn't leave their pocket unless you succeed!
* **Visibility:** Seriously, send those emails, to news outlets, relevant youtubers, whatever. I haven't gotten replies yet, but I'm trying my best to actually get people on board to get this project forward. 
* **Luck:** You can never account for all the variables that influence the campaign. So it's better to double check and make everything as foolproof as possible. Don't leave stuff hanging on luck. ",rpg,1739206841.0,0,6709,1181

Obviously it is touted as a universal system so it tends to pop up in basically every recommendation thread but my question is this: does anybody actually play GURPS? I would love to hear from people who have ran games using it or better yet, people actively running a game using GURPS. 

Edit: golly, much more input here than I expected. I’m at work so I can’t get into things much but I appreciate everyone’s perspective. GURPS clearly has much more of a following than I expected. It seems like GURPS can be a legit option for groups who are up to the frontloaded crunch and GM’s who are up to putting it together but perhaps showing a bit of its age compared to many of the new systems in the indie scene.

A long-time GM of mine, whom I played multiple years-long games under, moved to a different city as of late. They actually switched to DMing 5e as a system, and plan on sticking with it, because they find 5e to be a vastly superior platform for meeting and establishing rapport with new people and communities. Even one of the ""more successful"" non-5e RPGs, like *Pathfinder* 2e, is significantly worse as a platform for forging new social bonds, let alone a more obscure system.

This applies both in real life and online. 5e players and 5e communities are supremely more accessible and bustling than those of any other RPG.

Under this perspective, 5e might not be the best RPG, but it is far and away the best ""meet new people and forge bonds with them"" social platform among RPGs.",rpg,1733984527.0,0,885,159

I mean, I’ll keep running this game to see what it really has to offer, but I don’t think I’ll keep running it long term.

Compare that to Masks and some other more rules-lite games. Everything just flows, you can explain every rule in a few seconds and understand it in under a minute. And all of the unique mechanics are right there on the character sheet so nobody gets confused. Never mind that in PBTA games, the DCs are already set which speeds things up even more. And the lack of specificity lets me just whip up a ruling in a few seconds.

1431,173,1j14yrs,Free PDF with purchase,"I'm noticing an interesting split with companies that offer ""free PDF with purchase"" and those that don't.

It seems the older a company is, the less likely they are to offer a free PDF. These are my observations from the company I have dealt with:

'Old School' publishers

* WoTC/Hasbro - PDFs don't exist at all. Which is stupid.
* Paizo - PDFs cost extra.
* Troll Lord Games - PDFs cost extra, but they offer Print+PDF bundles at a discount.
* R. Talrorian Games - PDFs cost extra, but they participate in Bits and Mortar
* Chaosium - PDFs are free with purchase if you buy the book off their website. My attempts to get a free PDF from a retail purchase got denied. But they do participate in Bits and Mortar.
* Steve Jackson Games - PDFs cost extra. No Print+PDF bundles.

Newer Publishers:

* Arc Dream Publishing (Delta Green) - Show proof of purchase and they'll unlock PDFs on DriveThruRPG
* Mongoose Publishing (Traveller) - Show Proof of Purchase and they'll add PDFs to your account on their website
* Stellagama Publishing (Cepheus Deluxe) - Free PDF with purchase
* Independence Games (Clement Sector) - Freee PDF with purchase
* Zozer Games (Hostile) - Free PDF with purchase
* Sine Nome Publishing (Without Numbers) - Free PDF with purchase
* Catalyst Game Labs (Shadowrun) - Free PDF via emial with proof of purchase
* Modiphius (Star Trek Adventures) - Unlocked PDFs on DriveThruRPG with proof of purchasse
* Goodman Games (Dugeon Crawl Classics) - DriveThruRPG codes are printed in the book.

I'm sure there are other 'old school' publishers that offer free PDF with purchase. I just haven't bought from them. But there's definitely some kind of shift in mentality between older and newer publishers.

I never expect a free PDF. But I do expect a discounted PDF. Steve Jackson Games now sells all their GURPS stuff on Amazon as POD soft cover books. And most of the color soft cover books are $50. Every book is also available as a b&w softcover book for $30. But neither option includes a PDF. If I wanted to buy a softcover color copy of GURPS Magic, that would cost me $50, and then I would need to pay another $30 to buy the PDF.

Adam and Sage stopped being involved in Dungeon World in any way after this happened.

[In December 2024 they announced that Spencer Moore (myself) and Helena Real (/u/HelenaRealH) will design Dungeon World 2.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/1hl1nkr/dungeon_world_2_announcement_from_luke_crane/)

We've been designing the game since a bit before that announcement, and we are very excited for what we have right now. It's still not finished, but we expect to have closed alpha playtests within a month or two, and a wide-open beta playtest another month or two later. The second announcement above also describes our vision for the game. We can't say too much about the game details yet, but will soon!

I've noticed in recent years an uptick in the western genre in RPGs(hell, I'm even making my own), but what I've seen is that the vast majority of these games heavily feature elements of the supernatural. Frontier Scum, Weird Frontiers, Down Darker Trails, SWADE Deadlands, and others, but there is so little of the regular old western genre that so many of these titles are based on. If you go and look on DriveThru and sort by westerns, you'll see that the most popular non-fantasy/horror game is Boot Hill, which hasn't seen an update since the early 90's. This is also a trend in videogames, too, so I've noticed, in that besides RDR2, all the popular western videogames(Hunt, Weird West, Hard West, Evil West, etc.) prominently feature the supernatural as well.

I know that popular fiction tends toward the fantastical nowadays, but the complete lack of regular old western RPGs is mind-boggling to me, considering how the narrative genre fits so well into the way ttRPGs are played.

1445,187,1fz0l1c,The Mork Borg phenomenon,"I've had some thoughts lately that I would like to share with all of you, and see if it's just me and my mind behind this. 

Since 2020, Mork Borg has grown from a small indie game to a large-scale phenomenon, with dozens of Mork Borg products being systematically created. I've seen modules, adventure anthologies, beastiaries, spin-off titles, systems based on Mork Borg. They even released an action figure! It feels somewhat strange that a single RPG title got so much attention and grew so large in the span of only a few years.

Don't get me wrong, I have my fair share of MB products. I liked the aesthetic and the parodically dark world it creates, but how is it possible such a simple system based on OSR games to grab such a large portion of the RPG audience? 

One could argue that MB is 80% art and 20% game as Johan Nohr's AMAZING artwork fills every little part of every page, but there's little more than that. The systems it uses are not that unique and fresh, it's just more OSR that we've witnessed in countless other titles. But still, Mork Borg persisted over the rest, with Kickstarter being filled with ""Compatible with Mork Borg"" even more than the titles being ""5e compatible"".

You might ask, why I'm having such thoughts. Well, lately I've been seeing less and less designs based on Mork Borg, thinking that maybe its time is over. It made a huge leap in the market that is now slowly dying, the MB craze being over. And then, what do you know, a Mork Borg videogame is released!

I was surprised to find that almost everyone's answer was ""none"" or ""minimal"". It's incredibly strange to me, as people not bothering to get even the *basic* setting and rules down, not even *skimming* the book, just sound so dispassionate. I'm happy to teach alongside, of course, but they're not even putting minimal effort into understanding the game they're playing?

I wanted to run a game that pretty much requires that players understand the setting and rules to the point of reading half of a 400-page book. They just won't understand what they're actually doing otherwise. You might think, that sounds horrible, I don't want to do that. Most people don't.

But I finally found a group that *does*, and it's amazing seeing those people be passionate about the game they're playing itself. Enjoying the learning process, *wanting* to read more and understand. It's incredibly moving to see their excitement to *play* the game grow as they immerse themselves in it.

1456,198,1fagqno,"""Rules light but with lots of character options""","I often see requests for RPGs here that are both

* rules light and

* have lots of character options

I'm never sure what to recommend, because having lots of character options (in my experience) implies more rules.

Games like D&D5E, Pathfinder, and GURPS can give you lots of character options because they have lots of rules for character options to pull on. A character can be better at certain stats or skills, mess with die rolls for attacks/damage/initiative, circumvent or lessen penalties (cover, perception, encumbrance), and they can do those things in broad circumstances or niche ones. And the game rules respond by defining those circumstances and giving the GM ways to interact with them on their side of the screen.

And rules light games (again, broadly and in my experience) have fewer of those levers and buttons to mess with. Bonuses often come in broad categories (a bonus whenever a roll applies to your background), or they might be new ""minigames,"" like a PbtA move that gives you the entire rules for a new ability (teleportation or whatever) right in the move text.

(PbtA in particular seems like a game that, to me, offers a bunch of cool character options, but I feel like I also see people who want ""rules light/lots of character options"" saying no thanks to PbtA specifically.)

I'm offering all this without judgment; I like all kinds of games. I'm just interested in others' thoughts and in being exposed to games I might have overlooked.

* What kinds of ways is rules density tied to character options? 

* Are there games that, for you, deliver on the request of ""rules light/lots of character options""?

* Is there a *kind* of rules or a *kind* of character options that are implicit in these requests?

It uses Carved from Brindlewood mechanics, a sub-family of Powered by the Apocalypse games focused on collaboratively telling horror-mystery stories together. The game runs using a vast catalog of pre-written Threats, but none of them have official/canonical answers to their core Questions - the players must assemble a theory out of the Clues they’ve discovered, and roll to see how right they are. 

If you like PbtA games with super-specific, evocative playbooks, or want to really feast on a giant ‘menu’ of content to potentially run for your group, you could do a lot worse than this. $30 for a 3-book set digitally, $90 from them in hardcover (with decent rates on international shipping).

\-

For everyone else: Hello, everyone! I’m unaffiliated with The Gauntlet, but have fallen head over heels for the CfB system broadly and The Between in particular. I made [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1fhmvw1/the_between_comes_to_backerkit_in_one_week/) when this Backerkit campaign went live a month ago, but with a little over two days left, I want to highlight the bonus content they’ve already unlocked and what’s still left.

The core rulebook has 6 playbooks (and a 7th potentially unlocked during play!), 11 Threats to investigate, and a Mastermind to serve as the antagonist of your campaign - or at least, its first season. Shadow Society, an expansion book, adds 6 more new playbooks, another 20 Threats, and 3 additional/alternate Masterminds. Suns of Another World has 3 spin-off settings, alternate frameworks with their own 6 bespoke playbooks, plus Threats and a Mastermind unique to each - essentially separate, standalone games of The Between!

* **Ghosts of El Paso:** a Western; local notables trying to protect their town from a season of spirits
* **Unsinkable:** mystery at sea for the passengers and crew aboard a doomed Transatlantic ocean liner
* **Court of Wolves:** protect Louis XIV from the Satanists and werewolves allied against him

You could genuinely play this game for *years* before repeating any material (though there’s a lot of room for replays to go \*wildly\* differently with some branching choices). It’s full of clever, inspirational design. Despite a lot of obsessively-focused design, there’s enough wiggle room that one campaign could be horrifically brutal and grimy, while another could be more like two-fisted pulp with a bit of edge. With my home group, I’ve already got players speculating about “our *next* campaign” and “when *I* run this…”, which feels like some of the highest praise I could pass on. 

Give it a look! I’d love to hear your thoughts, and as a big fan of this game who wants to see it do well, I’d love to field any questions you might have. Their final few stretch goals include:

* 3 more playbooks (a gaggle of low-class henchmen being hunted by a serial killer, an Alice-like woman half-caught in daydream realm, and a chemist experimenting with a serum injected into their body)
* 2 more Masterminds (the vampire queen of a surreal otherworld who seeks to puppet the British monarchy and an aristocratic family of rival monster-hunters)
* a 4th alternate setting (with its own playbooks, Threat, and Mastermind!): **Blood & Coal**, about locals in Appalachia during the early Dust Bowl, fighting to preserve their home from demons

*First off, this is a self-promotion post. So, thanks for giving this post a look and a bit of your time.*

A couple of months ago, I released an OSR-inspired tabletop role-playing game of axes, runes, spirits, and legends, called Songs and Sagas. My twitter post blew up in popularity with like 22K views and 500 likes (even more unreal IMO considering the current state of the platform). Anyway.

I was really proud of the core and exploration mechanics I had designed, so I decided to open-license the game and publish a free creator kit and SRD for everyone to use. I then organized a game jam on Itch, and over 100 designers jumped on board, currently working on their own products to be ""Carried in Songs and Sagas"" (naming monikers is so fun \^\^).  

Now that we have 100 participants in the jam, I decided to celebrate by making the game **free for everyone**.

You can download the game on [itch](https://fari-rpgs.itch.io/songs-and-sagas) or go to [songsandsagas.farirpgs.com](http://songsandsagas.farirpgs.com) for more details around the game, creator kit, and what we plan to do next with the system.

Do keep an eye on the [submission page of the jam](https://itch.io/jam/songs-and-sagas-jam) because there are some pretty amazing designers working on their projects including the folks from A Couple of Drakes (Dead Belt, Court of Blades), Andrew Boyd of Pandion Games (Whispers in the Wall, Substratum Protocol), Matteo Sciutteri (Bloodstone, The Breach) and Alan Bahr of Gallant Knight Games(TinyD6, D6 System: Second Edition, SYMA)",rpg,1724423463.0,0,1565,249
1469,212,1d7p2bg,"I have a gripe, Girl By Moonlight","No, not with the system. Eclipse is BRILLIANT, the playbooks manage to span damn near every common trope, the setting rules really manage to push each different campaign into a different genre while still maintaining a magical girl feel; to such an extent that it has opened my eyes in ways I wish they had remained shut. I did not need to realize that Neon Genesis Evangelion was barely a step away from hitting the same notes as a dark magical girl show, but now I can't unsee it, ever. So thanks for that.

But my gripe is with the settings.

There's a continuous textual and metatextual pressure to make these settings, and these characters, revolutionary in flavor, that I feel doesn't necessarily vibe with either the original inspirational material or with the threats directly faced in the world. 

Now, I'm no enemy to media featuring revolt. Brinkwood: the Blood of Tyrants is my favorite Forged in the dark game. That game wastes absolutely no time in informing you that each and every one of the rich and powerful are literal bloodsucking vampires, that the only reason they can't go back to being normal humans is that it would involve giving up their power, and that they all deserve to be killed and have their blood fuel the visceral fae masks powering the revolution. But see, that's the core thrust of Brinkwood, the inspiration and intent in a single short statement: Mask Up. Spill blood. Drink the rich.

Girl By Moonlight does not have this core, clear directive. It leans on magical girl media, such as Sailor Moon (about a literal space monarch reclaiming her throne), Steven Universe (about how genocide can be made all better with a song), Escaflowne (where a full third of the cast are some kind of royalty), etc. The repeated insistance that the world is a crapsack that hates them mostly leave me wondering why the PCs would even try to save it; this place seems awful, let the abyss or the leviathans or whatever have it.

Magical girl media is frequently and fundamentally about a desire to defend what currently is. The everyday oppression faced by Usagi Tsukino is having to take tests she's not ready for, not the very real rise of reactionary politics in Japan at that time, and Magic Knight Rayearth is set in a place of light and wonder that these three strangers decide to protect together, not a shitty tyrannical state they... Still decide to protect together.

Girl By Moonlight is an excellent game, but I'm left wondering if the writers have watched the media that inspired it.",rpg,1717477001.0,0,2520,439

So i searched for players (through Facebook)

And after 3 weeks of searching i got 5.,Sadly one of them is a problem player

The player (lets call him ben).  Ben at first seemed fine.. talking to him you understand pretty quickly that he has autism (they way he speaks, hes tone , Extra)

I thought ""well a little challenging, but i work with people with hy functioning autism before i could take my time""..  i was worng

Next few problems arous :

He is a technophob. The man straight refuse to learn the basics of discord or how to feel character sheets *but op you said he is autistic you need to halp him its hard to even non autistic people""

Correct. I did.. multiple times .did even a fully camed solo session with him . The problem is that kind of abeloust techo phobia kills an all hour from the session. We meet ones every 2 weeks .i cant let a player hag an hour every start of session.

So i gave upp on some things, i handled his character sheet , and he rolls through discord (wich took us an hour to try to teach him how to write /roll: )

"" Why didnt you let him to use his own sheet he feels comfortable to use""

Because he cheats . before discord rolling he rolled in person..i trusted him ... untill i notcued he didn't roll below a 10...at all . Its a 2d6 system..you roll alot in traveller .its.... impossible to only get bellow a 10. So i stoped it though thr discord bot

The man is straight upp rud to other players..he cuts them speaking alot of times , quickly gets aggressive, refuse to change his minde. He demands alot of spot light. .and kinda worst of all..he is extremely unseries. Like I dont run hard core noir drama game..there is funny moments.but not to this level.the man straight upp run on cartoon logic because he created a clown(traveller isnt a cartoon game..is more similar to the expanse in the idea that th character are extremely human)

Tbh..i feel shame.. players left the game because of him and the campaign died..its because mainly i felt shame from wanting to kick him(mainly because of autism) so i didn't ..but now i understand that by not doing it i ignored  the  others players..and my self (god i didn't enjoyed it)..

So im going to kick this player..i don't have fun the others dont and man im going to feel shit doing it

I started paying attention to a couple of my own regular games, and realized I'm more likely to use first person — I tend to identify really closely with my characters, if I'm enjoying a game. If I'm saying ""I snarl and leap at him with my claws bared,"" it's probably because I'm identifying closely with my character, and feeling their emotions. I tend to associate ""\[Character's name\] picks up a chair and throws it at the loudmouth in the bar"" phrasing with someone who isn't inhabiting the character so much as storytelling with them as a tool.

Have you ever noticed this in your own habits? Are you more an ""I"" player or a ""they"" player? Does either one sound odd to you when other people do it? Do you think there's any significant difference between ""I smile"" and ""My character smiles"" when you're gaming?

As a side note, sometimes on the podcast, the players use second person, which I find a lot odder. That's what first got me thinking about this.

1477,220,1frzy73,The Twilight: 2000 Problem or: Can a mechanic be too good?,"Hi

yesterday i gmed my first game of Twilight: 2000 and it went...fine. While i would not say that we had a blast, we laughed, planned and had a good time.

But i\`m not sure we should have.

You know, if you flip through the pages of the Players Manual, one feeling is predominant imho: This is not a world i want to explore. This is a world where survival is hard, there are no interesting locations beyond the horizon, just another radioactive crater, and inside its perimeters, there will be no deathclaws, just people trying to shoot you because you have clean water. Also, its a world that resembles the pictures from the news maybe too much. Combat is also deadly (as expected), and the PCs doll a D6 to determine their starting radioactive poisoning...which can never be healed.

Short stories about young people killing soldiers, and pictures of gruesomely wounded people emphasize this impression. There is a reason why the kickstarter of the German version, planned for march 2022, never went online.

So, on the one hand, i get the feeling that this game wants the players to feel uncomfortable, giving them a tiny glimpse of being inhabitants of a destroyed Europe, and being as much as a .... message of peace maybe? as a TTRPG.

But..

Twilight 2000 is on the same time military porn and a quiet well made war game. The largest chapter is the one for equipment, with 10 different drawings (which are well made) of assault rifles alone. You get stat blocks for a dozen different tanks, and a combat system that is not only deadly, but also lightweight, but opens a lot of options for the PCs. One of our core experience was sitting around the map while players plan there next move.

And the game comes with hexmaps. Lots of them. And while the combat is deadly and easy, it can still take quiet some time to figure out ranges, cover etc.

This combination creates two problems, in my opinion:

1. The setting and rules discourage the players from combat, because the results of it can be devastating if something goes awry. But one the other side, combat is, arguably, the most fun thing the mechanics have to offer. So, as a player, you might get into a situation where you don\`t want to get into fight, because it would be the dumbest idea for your character to do, but on the other hand want to fight, because you enjoy the wargame.
2. I think that, for making the players feel the unease their PCs are in, the game needs a zoomed in perspective. You need to describe details, the atmosphere, and there needs to be a lot of player buy in. But, sitting around a map and discussing tactics with your mates is literally the opposite of being zoomed in. I don\`t think that a lot of groups can make the switch from ""Playing a war game"" to ""Playing a modern horror game where the monster is the worst of all: mankind"".

I would love to here if anyone had similar experiences, or found a solution to the dilemma. (Or just explain to me that there is no dilemma at all).

Thanks for the read.

  
Edit: Thankys to everyone for the insights. I think the different answer show one thing about our hobby: That every GM, every Group can turn a game to their own needs. ",rpg,1727599390.0,0,3178,576
1478,221,1bvuoqj,Forbideen Lands: Reasons you should (or shouldn't) play this game,"[My fast-paced, video review](https://youtu.be/Z3zdgOQGF_s) of the game for people who don't want to read.

&#x200B;

This is a game that, once upon a time, I saw got heaping tons and tons of praise and several awards for its design.

I was skeptical at first, because I don't adore survival/crafting mechanics in pretty much any game and the game emphasized a focus on ""hex-crawl exploration"" which has always been tiring and kind of boring in my experience.

However a year ago I ran a full campaign using this system, and good god did I fall in love with it.It IMMEDIATELY has an extremely charming aesthetic; they employed veteran fantasy artist Nils Gulliksson to absolutely nail the Golden-Age-of-RPGs vibe of the setting. It presents itself like classic, cheesy, conan comics and nerdy basement posters.

The actual gameplay is weird at first; it comes off as an OSR game but there's a surprising amount of survivability to the characters (I got through the campaign with a total of 3 character deaths). If your characters live long enough they get pretty strong, and learn very useful, cheesy abilities.

Threats never stop feeling threatening, however; no matter how strong your character is, a dragon is absolutely horrifying to fight, and even a simple zombie can still give your character a “this-many-days-until-you-insta-death” clock if they score a single bite on you.

The exploration can feel clunky sometimes, specifically when you want to fast-travel to the next town or you’re traveling SEVERAL in-game days without much physical progress, but when it’s not clunky it’s really charming and engaging. Every character has something to DO doing the travel/camping phases, and everyone gets to feel useful and have numerous chances to roleplay.

I adore this game, and I think it’s the solution for A LOT of people who want “more hardcore DnD but not insta-death, stats-don’t-matter randomness of OSR games”.

# Forbidden Lands

# Publisher: Free League Publishing

**REASONS YOU MAY LIKE IT:**

**Reason #1**

***The setting is a big, immersive sandbox of explorable lore***

Using the default setting is great because of how much history and lore is packed into it. The history of the world is fleshed-out, and throughout the game you’ll find ruins, artifacts and people that give little pieces to what happened before characters arrived. Even the monsters have lore discoveries if players can roll for it or ask the right NPCs.

This is the most “oooh”s and “aaahhh!”s I’ve ever had from players regarding lore in a campaign. The utter satisfaction of getting to say “oh King Doopty-Doo whose zombie you fought in session 2? This his castle” and hearing players go “Oh my god so that means this is his daughter!” is immensely satisfying.

It never has the random kitchen-sink feeling of DnD lore where you succeed a check and hear “The cultists hear worship Orcus!” and it doesn’t matter because the rest of the campaign has nothing to do with that random lore tidbit. It feels very alive and actually satisfying to learn along the way.You know how Elden Ring and Dark Souls give little pieces of the world lore with every item you find in the game? Forbidden Lands has a similar element.

&#x200B;

**Reason #2**

***Old-school brutality with modern progression and survivability***

Because of the dice pool “more damage means less dice for you” system, the game feels very brutal and every bit of damage matters. However, actually killing player characters takes some very unlucky rolls or extremely dangerous situations.

There is the POSSIBILITY of insta-death, but it takes a unlucky rolls for that to happen. Instead of insta-dying like in Borg games, or GUARANTEED eventual-destruction like Blades in the Dark, your characters will usually accrue wounds and physical debilitations (like Kingdom Death: Monster but less often and less devastating) such as a severed limb, or internal damage, that will impact their character but keep them alive. This is a game where players will very often search for any way they can avoid direct combat if they can help it.

If your character survives long enough, you will enjoy level ups and abilities that make them feel decently powerful, and experience actual progression and growth of your character’s abilities.

&#x200B;

**Reason #3**

***SO MANY TABLES!! So much VARIETY***

The game provides tons of random events and tables to roll from for just about every mechanics in the game; it makes everything feel fresh and varied. The story events you experience while traveling are really weird and unique and fun; they may flesh out the lore of the world, or present your characters a new possible side adventure, or introduce a new rival or ally.

Even hunting is done from a table for what kind of animal you find and mishaps occur along the way. Setting up camp can go wrong; you may accidentally walk through a bramble bush that tatters your clothes, or a rogue campfire can burn half the camp down.

If your characters establish a stronghold there’s so many events that can occur: maybe it has a leaky roof or a flock of Harpies inhabiting it when you find it. Rogue bandits or a king’s forces can stumble across it and declare its theirs. A bear can move in while nobody is there. Maybe your hirelings are tired of the terrible pay and simply leave.

It’s as exciting for the GM as it is for the players to find out what’s gonna happen when you enter any place.

&#x200B;

**Reason #4:**

***Immersive gameplay mechanics***

I really feel like it’s worth expressing just how immersive the gameplay feels.

Even when I started playing RPGs, it’s always been weird to me that a DnD character takes a sword in their stomach or an arrow in their shoulder and it doesn’t hinder them at all until they hit 0 HP. In this game, a broken glass bottle can debilitate you enough to make combat feel difficult.

Your characters actually feel hindered by harm, they feel exhausted after traveling without a break for days. It creates new roleplay situations and strategic decision-making for every encounter and travel scenarios.

“If we stop to rest tonight, we may not make it to the town healer in time to cure this poison in my blood; but if we push through and march for two days, we may collapse frome exhaustion.” This is an actual scenario that happened in our game (he collapsed from exhaustion and they had to carry him to the town; he was cured on the last day remaining before he died).

You can’t depend on coin-toss luck in a fight if all your characters are at half-strength; just like real life, it’s unlikely you’ll succeed if you’re all bleeding to death and a group of armed, well-rested enemies comes at you.

&#x200B;

**Reason #5:**

***Immersive survival mechanics that aren’t a burden or bookkeeping***

Your day is tracked in 4 quarters, and each quarter every character decides what theyre doing.Will you all hike another hex space, will you stop to make camp or hunt for food or search for a source of water to fill up? Will you craft more arrows or repair your gear damaged in the last fight? Every character decides what they contribute, so someone is always doing something for the party.Instead of tracking each individual resource in your inventory sheet, it’s all simplified for quick reference and access.

Resource dice are awesome; instead of tracking “okay I have 12 food units which can last us 3 days”, you simply roll your resource die to see if you have less food than you did before you ate. It abstracts “how much water do we have” instead of needing to use units of measurement that you’re constantly erasing.

Your characters need a warm, safe place to camp at night or they may be freezing through the night or ambushed by wandering enemies. You need to sleep, eat and drink every day because its debilitating to be tired, hungry or dehydrated.

The terrain you’re in, the weather and the time of day affect how these survival actions go but it’s all handled very quickly and simply with tables and easy modifiers, so it goes by fast when you want it to, and lasts a second when you want to roleplay or check your party’s condition.

&#x200B;

**Reason #6:**

***VERY friendly for on-the-fly GMing and GMs who don't like prep***

I edited this to mention something another commenter pointed out:

all the tables and random events mean there's a lot of sporadic adventure potential that takes no GM prep whatsoever.

My players have gotten distracted trying to find a home for a baby they found in the woods, exploring a town with a secret cult (that was randomly rolled for in the Adventure Site Generator), and even trying to settle down a tavern they established in a town.

In theory you could run a campaign without any overarching plot, and just having players explore dungeons/towns and looting treasures they find, because every adventure site and artifact has potential lore and adventure behind it.

&#x200B;

**Reason #7:**

***Monsters aren’t just damage sponges and actually have unique conditions***

Almost every monster has a table of special abilities to roll from that can alter the battle drastically. They also all have either a special weakness or condition that’s able to be manipulated:

you can try to hit between the monster’s missing scales (Smaug-style) to lower its armor. Another monster will continuously attack whoever is wearing the shiniest equipment. Another monster will be extremely weakened if you manage to cut off its tail first. Another monster has less attacks-per-turn if you cut off one of its arms.

You get the point.

Monster fights feel climactic, epic and scary. Their special ways they harm the player aren’t the only interesting thing about them; how they INTERACT with the battle and the battlefield adds a fun layer to their encounters.

&#x200B;

**Reasons you MAY NOT like this game:**

**Reason #1:**

***Direct combat can be slow***

If you get in a large scale fight, there’s always the possibility of it taking as long as a DnD or Pathfinder fight can.

It simplifies everything so there’s not that many modifiers or if-else conditionals, and it’s cool that hit success and damage is all calculated by one roll, but if an enemy has armor or youre using arrows it can feel a little clunky. Your non-combat characters (such as druid or Peddler) may not have as much to contribute to a fight besides “I hit them with my stick” which leaves them on the sidelines a little bit if things get very heavy.

There’s a chance combat will be quick and brutal, and end in a couple rounds, but there’s also a chance you’ll all just turn into the DnD Fighter class and continuously roll to attack every turn until someone falls down.

**Reason #2:**

***Messy Rulebook***

I don’t know WHY it’s so difficult for publishers to put ALL THE COMBAT-RELATED RULES IN ONE PLACE.Armor values, drowning rules, movement and actions, ranged attacks, prone attacks are all in far-apart pages/chapters and it means a lot of frantic flipping through pages while your players wait for a ruling. I had to keep my own personal Index page to quick-access all the most commonly-used rules.

&#x200B;

**Reason #3:**

***Magic doesn’t have a great risk-reward ratio***

Magic in the setting is extremely chaotic and dangerous to use;  basically everyone who uses magic in this setting is a DnD wild-mage.

Unfortunately, the level of danger doesn’t scale with the level of usefulness. Whether you’re using something simple like speak with animals or something destructive like fireball, there’s a chance your character can roll badly and severely wound/hinder/KILL themselves.

It would have been much better if the level of threat from magic matched the level of power of the magic being used instead of “use ANY spell and you might destroy yourself”. My magic users used spells as rarely as possible, which felt kind of lame; it felt like they were being punished for their class choice. Next time I run Forbidden Lands I’ll probably homebrew something to make it SLIGHTLY less devastating.

&#x200B;

**Reason #4:**

***Definitely not a “tactical” game***

It has tactical situations, but if you want grid-based, minmax, strategy game scenarios you may be disappointed.

The combat is more strategic than most Free League games, but it still prioritizes narrative and realistic brutality over video-gaminess.

&#x200B;

**Reason #5:**

***The cool discoverable lore is difficult to work with without a published campaign***

In fact, all of the provided lore in the Game Master Guide relates to the published “Raven’s Purge” campaign. If you want to use the setting yourself, it’s going to take a lot of writing and GM prep to prepare an epic campaign with discoverable lore.

The mechanics still work great by themselves, but a big portion of the game’s fun is discovering the world lore as you travel, so without the published campaign to provide context you have to make a lot of stuff up and have your own reasoning for why things are the way they are.

Basically, if you want to run a campaign with this game without a published adventure, I hope you’re into worldbuilding.

**CONCLUSION:**

I adore this game.

It’s one of my top 3 favorite games of all time, and the campaign that spanned a year holds a very special place in my heart. My players had a great time, I had an amazing time, and the story was so epic and classic and cool.Players are encouraged to be bandits and thieves if they desire, or a ragtag band of heroes that saves the world. Either way, it continues Free League’s tradition of “you’re regular people in extraordinary circumstances”.

The vibe is awesome, the gameplay is so much fun, and this is my go-to game when people ask for survival mechanics or low-magic fantasy realism.I can’t recommend this game enough.",rpg,1712255301.0,0,13779,2323

1481,224,1i4042g,Why are Moves not Skills?,"# So, you want to know what a PBTA Move is

In a [recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1i3wcgi/what_are_some_elements_of_ttrpgs_like_mechanics/) we saw a tussle about whether Moves are just Skills in a fancy wrapper. There were a lot of explanations being traded, but Moves can still be hard to grok.

## What is a Skill? A Move?
A **Skill** is: 

* A score which gives a bonus to a dice roll 
* When a character attempts a specific action
* Where the result of the roll determines whether the character succeeds or fails
* Where the bonus measures the ability of a character to perform a certain action

You don't need these examples of Skills, but:

* Lockpicking
* Marksmanship
* Bartering

A **Move** is:

* Step-by-step instructions or procedure
* That tells players what to do at certain times
* Which may or may not include rolling dice

That sounds a bit general, doesn't it? Examples of Moves are:

* Profess Your Love
* Act Under Pressure
* Lash Out

## A Venn diagram
The Venn diagram would look like:

* A Skill could be a Move
* But Moves are not just Skills
* A Long Rest could be a Move
* Even ending a session could be a Move

If you wrote the Lockpicking Skill like a Move, it would look like:

> **Break & Enter:** When you *try to get where you're not supposed to be*, roll +Smart.
> 
> * On a 10+, you're in and no-one is the wiser
> * On a 7-9, you're in, but you did it loudly, slowly, or broke something
> * On a 1-6, it won't budge and they're after you, get out of here!

## Hold on, that's very different
Can you kill the skeleton with your sword? That's what rules decide in a traditional RPG. But Moves solve the problem where you want to:

* Codify (turn into rules) ""the story"" (tropes, archetypes, cliches)
* Making the story something players can interact with using rules

This means that, similar to how players understand the possible outcomes when they attempt to hit the skeleton with your sword (making it fair and consistent), players also understand the possible outcomes when they lash out emotionally at their ex-husband. 

Moves are about **codifying storytelling** and **making it accessible**.

## Let's go back to Long Rests
This means if a game with Moves has a ""Long Rest"" move, it might not just be, if you rest for X hours, you regain Z hitpoints, but also: 

* Trading secrets
* Training
* Brooding
* Hearts to hearts

## Fiction first
Because Moves turn the story into rules, they are very strict about the 4th wall. Never say ""I Act Under Fire"", say, ""I run straight through the gunfire"".

This helps because which Move corresponds to which action depends on **intent**. If you're running through gunfire to save your loved one, it might be ""Prove Your Love"" instead. You're not using your Run Through Gunfire skill. You're performing a specific action within the story, and running through gunfire could be...

* Cowardly
* Heroic
* Romantic

Moves focus on the story behind the things you do

## Other characteristics of Moves
Moves usually have:

* Triggers, phrased like:

> When you X, Z.

* No binary success/failure, because just plain failure is boring

> When you X, roll Z. On a result of:
> 
> * A strong hit (10+), [spectacular success]
> * On a weak hit (7-9), [mixed success]
> * On a miss, (6 or less), [opportunity for the Game Master]

* Explicit consequences for failure

> On a mixed success, you convince them, but:
> 
> * They want an assurance from you now
> * You hurt someone close to you
> * You have to be honest with them

* Rules that require the Game Master to give you information 

> On a strong success, ask the Game Master two of the below:
> 
> * What happened here?
> * What sort of creature is it?
> * What can it do?
> * What can hurt it?
> * Where did it go?
> * What was it going to do?
> * What is being concealed here?
>
> They have to be honest with you.

* Interactions with not just NPCs, but other players (often sexual!)

> When you have sex:
> 
> * They get +1 XP but must be honest with you
> * You get +1 History forward

* Rules for incrementing clocks and resources
* Rules that interlink with other Moves
* Rules that constrain the Game Master (they're not a god, just a player)

## So, why not Skills?
If you had a game like *Pasion de la Pasions*, a telenova about dramatic families having sex with each other, have Skills like +10 Yelling where a successful roll would take -5 Hit Points... the game wouldn't make much sense. Instead, you have Moves like this one:

> When you flash back to reveal a shocking truth about another PC, mark a condition and roll with conditions marked. On a hit, the news is staggering; before acting against you, they must act with desperation. On a 7-9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2:
> 
> * You have unequivocal evidence this is true.
> * The shocking truth gives you rightful claim to
something they value.
> * You introduce a shocking new character who has
your back.
> * On a miss, it blows up in your face--hard. The GM
will tell you how.

## Pros and cons of Moves
Moves:

* Make it easy for everyone to engage with the story
* Help make storytelling more consistent, not just up to having a great GM
* Make it possible to play genre fiction games! How else could you do telenovas?

But they also:

* Can feel formulaic or prescriptive 
* Can feel confusing if you've only ever played traditional RPGs

(Moves should inspire creativity rather than restricting it, but anyway!)

1482,225,1cq8sgt,Why do Game Masters on here view 5E as very taxing? Genuine question from another GM.,"Hey everyone. I know the question as is might seem rude. But as someone who has GMed 5E for the past 10 years (on and off with breaks) and has run other games as well although for certain not as long (primarily Lancer) I don't really understand the sentiment that 5E is heavily taxing for GMs. Maybes its just because it's been such a long time since I really had to think about it. Everything for me feels very automated at this point. I have all these tools and resources I am familiar with that make the process very light for me/ enjoyable regardless of effort. I tend to personally prep for 3-5 hours for each session. This usually provides enough for 2-3 sessions depending on how fast the group is going which often even allows me to not need to prep at all. If anything it can feel like a lot more effort is needed for new games but I tend to not view that too negatively. Learning a new set of rules, finding a new set of tools for GMing etc can be its own reward and adventure. with the added bonus that you get to interact with that community a lot (shout-out to the Lancer Discord server for always being so friendly and patient!).

this post isn't really about draw steel. most of the time i'd rather play other games; the big-damn-heroes epic fantasy isn't really my thing, i don't like the tone it's written in, etc etc. but any kind of vaguely d&d-shaped game is *so much more fun* when you don't have a random chance to miss every attack. i can't stand to-hit rolls anymore. they have upsides, there's plenty of perfectly valid reasons to like them, but none of those reasons come even close to making up for how much of a slog combat becomes when you have all these unnecessary random chances to waste your turn. not just waste your action in a fight, but waste everyone's real-life time.

## Some Details On What You're Seeing Here

The pages are printed on standard US Letter 20 lb. Paper. The reason why the pages are not flat is because I used my laser printer to print these, a Brother HL-3170CDW.  It has a pretty short paper paper, so pages tend to curl. It's not very noticable when you print a few pages. But it's noticable, when you print a big stack of pages.

I like the cover to be a little rigid and protected.  So, for the covers, I glued the pages to magazine backer boards used by comic collectors and then wrapped the front and back in contact paper.

## Notes about Wire Binding

The machine I bought is a wire binding, sometimes called a wire-o-binding, machine. The machines come in 2 different pitch sizes: 3:1 and 2:1. 3:1 will only let you bind 120-130 sheets (240-260 pages). If you want to bind larger than that, you need to use 2:1. The machine I bought only does 3:1, which has a maximum wire diameter of 9/16"".

They make combo machines that can do both 3:1 and 2:1, but those gets pretty pricey.

Wire binding has the advantage of lying completely flat and you can also fold it back 180 degress.  Spiral/Coil binding does the smae thing. But with Wire binding, when you fold it back, the folded back pages line up with the pages that are not folded back. With wire/coil binding they're shift up a little.

Amd wire binding is, as expected by the name, made of metal.  It's pretty stiff metal, but if it gets bent, you will not easily bend it back. You're going to be undoing the binding and rebinding it.

## Notes About The Specific Wire Binding Machine

1490,233,1gqz1o2,"Well, I suddenly ran Dragonbane.","You might remember me from such threads as ""Who and What is Dragonbane for?""

Well, tonight my group was expecting to continue into our fourth session of a GMless Ironsworn: Starforged campaign, but one of our players never made it. We assume he was sleeping, as he is insane and wakes up at 4am to play with us every week. It's a wonder this is the first time he didn't show up to a session.

So, with everybody sitting around at gametime wondering what we're going to do, I suggest we each throw a game into a pile and roll a d100. Highest roll runs a game. I had just re-read a quarter of the rules for Dragonbane due to the thread I made yesterday, so I obviously felt completely comfortable running the game with no warning.

Luckily, I rolled a 31 on the D100, so somebody else is going to be running the game tonight. Second player rolled a 21. Alright. Third player didn't have a game ready to run (we're not all going to learn Flying Circus right the fuck now). Last player rolls a 29. I ask if he accidentally rolled a d20 instead.

Nope.

Well, that settles it then, I'm suddenly running Dragonbane with my roll of 31. Thankfully, I purchased the core rulebook module for FoundryVTT when Free League was having a sale ~6 months ago.

Now, the adrenaline starts kicking in a little bit. I have to run a game I read 70% of the rules of a year ago, with no prep, and never having read any adventure for it. The other three start skimming the rules, and I decide it's a better use of my time to pre-read a bit of the adventure in the back of the core book instead of trying to refresh myself on the rules for 5 minutes.

Honestly, it probably would have been better for me to refresh myself on the rules. Not because I needed to, or any big mistakes were made rules-wise, but because the adventure was dead simple to run with entirely new eyes. Good stuff, if not a bit bland.

So how did it go?

Well, the heavily armoured and entirely cocksure Mallard walked right into a trap on the party's way up to the fort where the adventure primarily resides. And, wouldn't you know it, the trap didn't do enough damage to get past his armour. What better way to turn confidence into overconfidence? He proceeded to accidentally run into, and activate, every trap possible.

The Mallard activated the alarm bells for the fort, and the ambush of 6 Goblins was very quickly put down by the martial abilities of the Wolfkin.

After they thoroughly explored the fort, tied the goblin leader to a tree, made friends with the Orc and her hog, and were on their way out with a couple pocketfuls of treasure, the final boss appeared. The nearly-translucent form of a ghostly armoured knight, mounted on horseback, blocking their exit. 

The mallard, wearing the helmet of this old wights slayer in ancient times (because of course), immediately drew attention and ire. And at the same time, he felt the skull he had retrieved from the bottom of the well shift in his bag, looking through him toward the undead.

The Archmaster, behind the Mallard and the Wolfkin, attempted to cast a fireball at the ghost, rolled a demon, and took just enough damage to knock himself out, as he lost control of his power. The Wolfkin attacked ferociously, but couldn't get through the armour of the ghastly knight.

The Mallard took out from his pack the skull he found in the bottom of the well, launched it into the air, and struck it with his battleaxe. The skull exploded; dead dust propelled onto the rider himself.

While this act will destroy the rider soon, the ghost is pissed and goes at him with everything it has before it turns to dust. The rider uses its undead powers to freeze the Mallard in place right before its ghostly form faded to nothingness. Well, that puts things right, right? Well, with the undead now dead, the castle everyone is standing (or dying) in begins to tremble and shake mightily; collapsing around them.

The Wolfkin rushes to pick up the frail wizard and carry him out, but takes just enough damage to go down beside the duck. The duck, having been frozen in place by the undead spell, finally succeeds at the check to break free. He's at a single point of HP from the collapse of the castle around him. He makes the strength check to grab and start dragging both his companions. But rolls a Demon on his acrobatics check to make it over the now-destroyed bridge leading out of the fort.

All the players die. The adventure ends with the two NPC party members, who had made it clear they were going to compeltely waste their share of the treasure, thinking about how all the treasure was still on the bodies of the people a castle just crashed down on.

The game was fun, it was easy to run with zero prep, it was very quick to teach, and it performed admirably in an old-school mini-adventure. There was little rules-confusion, it was easy to find answers quickly by looking where the info should be in the pdf, and the couple things we didn't want to break the pacing to find were easy to improvise. Everybody had a good time. It matched up perfectly to the common sentiment in the last thread.

Am I ever going to play it again? I don't honestly know. There wasn't much exciting about the system. I've only played ~10 out of the 25+ other rules-lite, low prep, OSR-adjascent fantasy games I own. But maybe the next one of those games I reach for will feel worse than Dragonbane, or get in my way somehow. If it does, I could very well see a future where I think back to this session fondly.",rpg,1731567070.0,0,5508,1008
1491,234,1cwm6ek,Companies that support brick-and-mortar stores by providing PDFs when you provide proof of purchase,"Hello, just wanted to give a shout out to Dire Wolf Games for providing me with a PDF after I purchased a print copy of the Cortex Prime RPG.

After having gone through a similar process with Fate of Cthulhu and Savage Worlds, I thought it'd be nice for potential buyers to know which companies support brick-and-mortar stores by providing PDF copies to go along with your physical purchase. So far in my firsthand experience I have:

* Dire Wolf Games (Cortex Prime)
* Pinnacle (Savage Worlds)
* Evil Hat Productions (Fate, Blades in the Dark, Thirsty Sword Lesbians)

Any others to add to the list? Specifically looking for those that provide a digital copy after you buy the physical. It's not uncommon for companies to sell both together, but that doesn't help a gaming store out.

Edit: Thanks to those who recommended [https://www.bits-and-mortar.com/](https://www.bits-and-mortar.com/) for this.

[https://rpggeek.com/geeklist/280234/rpg-kickstarter-geeklist-tracking?itemid=10360304#10360304](https://rpggeek.com/geeklist/280234/rpg-kickstarter-geeklist-tracking?itemid=10360304#10360304)

Key points:

\* 2024 saw the greatest number of projects ever (1892), beating the previous record in 2023 (1754)  
\* 2024 had the 2nd largest funding total ever (US$64M), beating last year (US$59M) but not the record in 2021 (US$84M)  
\* However, this total is somewhat misleading as 23% arises from a single project: the Cosmere RPG (US$15M). Without that project the total would have been lower than in both 2022 and 2023.  
\* The number of 5E related projects continued to increase (796 this year versus 656 last year). However, the value of 5E projects plummeted (US$19M this year versus US$30M last year).  
\* The large decrease in 5E funding compared to the increase in 5E projects can be partially explained by the large number of what could be described as ""dollar store"" projects placed on Kickstarter last year. 50% of 5E projects last year had a funding goal of <=US$500, compared to: 2023 41%, 2022 28%, 2021 18%. Anecdotally, these projects very often include AI-generated art and are of the ""100 X to add to your game"" type, or small adventures/modules. These projects do fund; 86% of 5E projects funded this year compared to 87% in 2023 and 84% in 2022, so it is unlikely they will go away any time soon.

1493,236,1hoj914,Is it wrong to “pull rank” as a GM?,"A bit of context, I have been friends with everyone at my table for very long. We are chill, and we communicate our issues with each other like adults.

I am the Default GM at our table. Occasionally, someone else might volunteer to take the seat for a oneshot or mini campaign, but if I don’t set up a session, we might spend 2-3 months without meeting. Though we started by playing D&D, over the years I have moved away from the system, tried out a few others, and eventually settled in one that allowed me to tell the stories I wanted to. 

About half of the table still really likes D&D, and though I used to sprinkle one here and there, but after they recently asked for one I finally decided to say “look, if you manage to get someone to run D&D for that day, I’ll give them the slot, but I am not.” Of course, nobody wanted to run anything on short notice, and they mentioned that they are a bit burned out from my campaign, so the session got effectively cancelled. 

I know I can run/not run whatever I want, but I don’t want to unilaterally kill our regular hangouts (I have little trust of one of them running D&D regularly) so I’m mostly wondering if there was any alternatives I’m missing, or if I was wrong to give an ultimatum like that.

Even when the scenario is constrained to a single ship or base, it's like the endless potential of space just crowds out everything else. 

I'm seriously to the point of throwing in the towel. I've been trying to come up with a Mothership one shot for three weeks and I've got nothing. I hate to give up; one of my players bought the game and gifted it to me and he's so excited to play it.

1503,8,tqdq72,5e only players reviewing Original or OSR is weird.,"Note: This is not a bash of 5e. This is not a bash of 5e players. This is an observation of the odd choices of words 5e player who review or talk about classic D&amp;D and retroclones use to talk about them.

I’m watching a 5e player review OSE on YouTube. While the review is very positive and they enjoyed the game, some of the descriptions are just weird. They remind me of some podcasts of 5e players trying B/X and what they said, which was quite negative.

I mean, there are plenty of modern RPGs that are rules light (even if only player facing) and plenty that have very simple character sheets. Yet, when talking about a classic D&amp;D or retroclone’s character sheet, at best the simplicity needs to talked about in an oddly patronizing way that assumes more is better.

This ignorance that there are other games from the 70s and early 80s that are mostly unchanged and still played is often also shown. 

The other thing that always seems weird is that need to simplify the math for modern sensibilities. Do they not know Call of Cthulhu is likely the number two RPG and the latest edition makes you multiply and divid. The insanity of it. While 5e players talking about a classic D&amp;D rule set having subtraction.

Thing is. Most 5e players have only played 5e and seem unaware the come to the table of any other editions or TTRPG with a ton of biases. 

Original to B/X to OSR are as different to 5e as are most other RPGs to 5e. Rather than talking about early editions as quaint, it would be better to look at them as something completely new.

Edit: some people are missing the point above. It is great that 5e YouTubers and podcasters are checking out OSR. They just say the weirdest things, not wrong, not inaccurate, just odd. Partly due to their single point of reference. Partly due to not wanting to compare in a way that comes across as the smallest slight to 5e, forcing some weird backhanded compliments.

Edit 2: there was a video that brought about this post, but I didn’t link it it as my original intent was not call put this YouTuber or the video in particular, but mention a more generalized observation. The video is good and glad someone else added the link. The presenter did a great job too, and as some have pointed out the choice of words is all about the audience they are speaking to, causing the almost “this is good” while also apologetic. One more time, the presenter was awesome, glad they did this video and glad they enjoy OSE. 

Also glad to see the comments on that video are super positive (the ones I saw anyway). Mostly gentle mentions that OSE is B/X and that OSR can support narrative gaming.",osr,1648486377.0,1,2648,482

1507,16,1gxwsog,His Majesty the Worm - Playtest Review,"Hello everyone!

Yesterday three of my players and I opted to run the ""Tutorial Dungeon"" provided in His Majesty The Worm and it was an absolute blast! I will break down my experiences and thoughts. Please understand that I won't explain all the rules here, there is so much unique stuff and so many interactions to explain it all - the post is long enough as it is. So, I fear you have to know the system a bit to get all my points.

DUNGEON: The dungeon is super cool, includes a lot of neat ideas, conflict, and many opportunities for roleplaying. I don't want to spoil it. Just run it and see for yourself!
Also, big props for how the dungeon and room descriptions are layed out. It was super easy to run it, even after only skimming it once.

GAME: Character creation takes quite a lot of time the first time around (3 players, online, 1.5h) and the combat mechanics are VERY different than the other games we've played. That being said, the characters and their abilities are super flavorful. I really like that you can spend XP on the fly to use untrained talents. There was never a situation where not at least one character could do something useful. 
Camp actions are great. Reminded me a lot of Darkest Dungeon. You can get cool buffs for your group, research, etc. It interacts neatly with the Bond mechanic, which really encourages teamwork and roleplay imo.

COMBAT: It might take 1-2 combats to ""get it""  but after that things get rollin. Combat is very tactical, fast and interactive. You draw hands of tarot cards and can play them on your turn, and the turns of other combatants to act. The main action and minor action (acting on someone else's turn) setup leads to super dynamic and cinematic combat where you have almost no downtime. I also like the idea of your initiative being your defense and the many ways how you can change it on the fly.

UNSURE: 
1. I think some of the character abilities are quite strong and a get free out of jail card in many circumstances. I am interested how it feels for long proper campaigns when character start to master more talents (the in-training mechanic keeps them in check for the first few sessions).
2. The enemies we've encountered didn't really feel like a threat - this of course might be caused by playing the starter dungeon. We also were not able to finish the whole dungeon in one session, so they have not yet met all the dangers lurking down there. Just glancing at it though characters have quite a few ways to negate damage (conditions, wounding talents, notching armor, etc), and most enemies only deal 1 damage.
3. I usually play with groups for 4-7 players. I think in groups that large (speak: with that much inventory space), the light mechanic will not add much to the drama, but be more of annoyence. Each light source has a number of times it can flicker (caused by various events) before it goes out. Larger groups will be able to carry so many light sources, rations and tools, that I don't know how effective the threat of dwindling light will be. Have to see that.

Alright, for everyone still reading my mad ramblings: our test session of HMTW was great, the mechanics and rules flow in a unique way and I am looking forward to running it again.

1508,17,1bjf3kf,Q: How to enroll play testers and reviewers for an original OD&D campaign/world,"Hey everyone,

TL/DR: What started as a one-shot campaign idea has now spread to:  


* 10 major locations.
* 30 maps (towns, buildings, dungeons, now being professionally rendered).
* 90 NPCs (though many are just a single line of text and not plot critical)- Dozens of side quests.
* 6 exemplar PCs (that right now I'm just using for artwork).
* Includes town, wilderness, and dungeon adventures.
* Could easily end up being...dunno...8 modules? Hard to say w/o people playtesting it. There is certainly room to keep expanding it (I have to locations not yet written).

Woof!  This is all done using the AD&D books (excluding FF & MM2) because...well I'm old. :-p

Premise:  The party has been given a quest to recover a holy relic that was stolen and taken into the ""mouse world"". In order to recover it the party will need to transform into mice versions of themselves and explore the Lake District (what I'm calling it for now).  Essentially it started as ""wouldn't it be cool to play DnD as mice versions of PCs"" (think Redwall, MouseGuard, etc.)

My problem(s) I'd like advice on are:

1. Play testing: Getting people to review what I've created prior to publishing. I've stopped writing new content and am focusing on editing what I have already, and am doing my best to ensure it all makes sense and is balanced, but until people actually \*play\* it, how do you know?
2. Publishing: Never done anything like this and am still reading through it.  Yes, I can read blogs, articles, etc. but it would be great to actually speak to someone directly who has done this, e.g. an original setting, original art, etc.    Does anyone know someone who has this done before and would be open to mentoring a newbie?

FAQ

1. Yes, at some point it will need to be able to be played in 5e if I really want to get to a broader audience. I played 5e once and it wasn't my thing, so would have to partner with someone to make this happen (likely a supplement?)
2. Personally I think there is a lot of potential to keep adding more adventures, so will keep writing as tbh it's a lot of run.
3. Yes, you could ditch the mouse concept entirely without much fuss if it's not your thing, as nearly every animal is mapped to an OD&D MM analog.
4. I avoided FF & MM2 and UA for simplicity's sake, as not everyone uses those materials, but it would be easy enough to include material from them.  


Thanks so much for all the comments - you guys are great! :)  I've already started to fold the ideas in.

1521,84,122fsli,DnD 'Honour among Thieves' review: It's good [minor spoilers],"TLDR: It's a good fun movie; not great, but solidily fun with an incredibly charasmatic cast.

I was not going to watch the movie as the whole OGL scandal really soured me on WotC, but the early reviews were good and I liked some of the actors involved so went to an early screening last night - and the movie was good.

It's not particularly risky or revolutionary, but it has some great humour and some big laugh out loud moments in the cinema and is very enjoyable.

I don't know how but they managed to find possibly the most charasmatic cast in Hollywood, and they are pretty uniformly great - Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Rege Page, Sophia Lillis, Daisy Head all are very watchable with Justice Smith as Simon the Sorcerer and Hugh Grant being the stand outs.

The plot is standard fair.  It's nothing special and I'd even say some of the plot turns are not that logical and sometimes feel forced, but the film works because of the humour and the general 'good feeling'.

The Red Wizards were a bit too cartoon villainy for my liking.  The main female baddy is good but we get a shot of Szass Tan and there is none of the subtley of the character; they just went for 'shadowy evil'.  I guess it''s fair enough but even Megatron has some campy evil about him.

As to the 'DnD'ness of it, the Forgotten Realms is such a compelling setting and it's really great to see it come to life and see some Iconic DnD monsters and locales; I particularly liked the detour into the underdark.

Overall I would recommend the movie to all DnD fans, even if they are soured on WotC, as it's a fun night in the cinema, and to all non DnD fans as the movie stands on it's own merits.

7.5/10

&#x200B;

From my review:

>*Brimstone* assumes a late medieval/early Modern setting, something like that of *Lamentations of the Flame Princess* or *Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay* (I don't think it would be too hard to reskin to other settings). Here, as in *WFRP*, your character may end up missing limbs, blown up by a blackpowder weapon's misfire, charred by a backfiring spell, or ruing the day they made one deal too many with nefarious cosmic powers. **Unlike** ***WFRP*****, however,** ***Brimstone*** **emphasizes capable, creative heroes who are just as likely to dish out serious hurt on their foes - and do so with flair.** Offering almost cinematic action with OSR-compatibility and low mechanical complexity, *Brimstone* is not just a game about random almost-heroes dying in a gutter. Again, the game's stated goals combine *high action* with *high peril*.

1529,109,17jxo3o,Mydwandr review,"So I recently discovered [r/NSRRPG](https://old.reddit.com/r/NSRRPG/) which led to me discovering the very cool new rpg by Old House Rules *Mydwandr*. Here are some of the games features:

* Mechanic -- roll 2 dice (always d6) and succeed on 8 or more. Roll an extra die and sum the highest two if good play has created an advantage for the PC, or if the PC has a relevant ability.

* Abilities are not scores, but descriptive (i.e. Light-footed, Mighty, Footman), either providing an extra die when attempting something anyone could attempt, a roll of two dice when attempting something which would only be possible with training, or a special capability such as magic. 

* The system is classless, with the choice of abilities determining the type of character.

* Kindred - there are rules for elves and dwarves. Dwarves roll three dice for all saves (except death) and two dice to detect unsafe conditions underground or in the mountains. Elves always have an initiative of at least 8 going into combat (initiative seems pretty important in the game -- combat abilities only providing their bonus die if you win it) and can move stealthily in armor. Both Elves and Dwarves start with 10 HP and 1 ability. Humans get +5 HP (15) and an extra ability.

* Armor and shields provide a save versus death at 0HP. A success means +5HP but the armor is damaged.

* Advancement is awarded for finishing quests, combat, and major treasures. Leveling up means more HP and adding additional abilities. 

* Magic is free-form but limited in how many times it can be cast (once per day/lvl) and extent (having to do with duration, amount of damage, the number effected etc.) and cannot be cast in armor.

* The game is complete in 64 pages, with monster and treasure details and a lightly sketched out campaign setting.

My thoughts -- it's elegant and looks super fun. The single mechanic means that it will be super easy to hack -- adding new Kindred and abilities. The book looks great, using attractive and good sized fonts and woodblock style art, and at 64 digest pages is a good candidate for printing and stapling yourself (the woodcuts will use a good amount of ink, and I laid each page out to dry after printing using an inkjet). 

The writing itself is interesting -- it has a definite style and character which I really like, although it may come at the expense of clarity at times. Not at all in a bad way -- more like Gygaxian, where here and there you find yourself reading a sentence more than once to understand its import, and yet the charm of the writing makes it worth it. 

There was also at least one place where an idea was introduced (invisibility in relation to the monster Feydark -- basically dark elves) and the rule was elaborated elsewhere (invisibility and how to handle it is discussed in relation to invisibility potions). The nice thing is the book is a quick read so it doesn't take much time to read the rules in their entirety.

I would think converting other OSR material for use with Mydwandr would be relatively trivial.

1531,112,1bqx82s,Magic Items Review,"These items are themed for the Dolmenwood setting. They once belonged to Lord Orpheo Guillefer, but have since been lost. If all the items are collected and a ritual is performed within the inner sanctum of the Halls of Sleep (citadel of House Guillefer) the bearer of these items will be granted some additional special powers, yet to be determined. (But likely something to do with astral projection, or entrance to the lands of fairy)

I’m looking for feedback on my descriptions, the abilities/drawbacks, and maybe an idea of what to do with the “Ring of Reverie” I’ve kinda lost my steam.

Circlet of Slumber — A white-gold circlet set with amethysts, emblazoned with the seal of House Guillefer upon its brow. The wearer gets a good nights rest no matter the conditions, and recovers HP while sleeping or resting with a +1 bonus (2 hp a night, or 1d3+1 a day). However, the wearer is often overcome with a great weariness, resulting in them always acting last during combat (as if they had lost initiative), and having a 1-6 chance of spontaneously falling asleep each round of combat. (Once worn, the owner of this circle is compelled to wear it at all times, and will not discard it unless a successful Remove Curse spell is performed.)

Scepter of Somnabulance (10 charges) — An ornate scepter of platinum, encrusted with iridescent stones, topped with the yawning visage of a manticore. The wielder of this scepter seems to shuffle about with the least concern, their speed is reduced by 10’, and they are unable to make forced marches. This scepter may be wielded as a magical club as long as it has at least one charge (+2, 1d4+2). Its charges may be replenished by ritually anointing the scepter in the water of Dark Mirror Lake under the light of the Full Narrow Moon. 

- If the wielder of the scepter is an arcane spellcaster, or also wears the Circlet of Slumber, they may cast the following spells using the appropriate number of charges:
    * Vapours of Dream (1 charge)
    * Phantasm (3 charges)
    * Hallucinatory Terrain (4 charges)

Ring of Reverie —  A thin band of pellucidium dappled with winking adamants, and set with a marquise-cut sapphire between two golden moth’s wings.  (Abilities undetermined)

1534,122,117tzg8,Black Wyrm of Brandonsford Report/Review,"Finished running Black Wyrm today after 3 3-hour sessions, and love reading people's thoughts on modules, so thought I'd do a little write up.  Really curious to hear how this played out for other people too. Review at the end.

Report:

First session, also first session of the campaign, and first time playing any tabletop in about a decade for the players, so we were all pretty hyped.  Started out in a town central to the region, through out rumors for all the modules I'm prepared to run, and the party bit on rumors of a beast terrorizing the woods around Brandonsford. A day and half walk on the road brought them to town, where they talked with all of the NPCs.  This kinda felt like an info dump, the town has a lot of entries for NPCs, relating to each other, so it was logical that the players would go through chatting with everyone.  Ended up heading to the barrow. A hired NPC dropped to 0 in a fight with some goblins, had to decide right there if I was gonna make this game hardcore mode or not.  He passed a death save, so I ruled he was stable, for now. Session ended there.

&#x200B;

Session 2, the cleric PC caved and expended a healing scroll (loaned by the priest in town) to get the NPC thief above 0 HP, so I called it a second wind and he rejoined the party.  They were doing great in the crypt, moving steadily through level 2.  The cleric gets hit by one of the statues, trying to turn the final ghost, dropping negative.  Failed two death saving throws... thought about killing him, but it just didn't feel right for a PC death at this time with this group, I didn't want to kill the morale I guess.  Had the player take control of an NPC while the cleric was unconscious.  The party then somehow finds healing potions, and fed them all to the cleric.  This seemed significant enough of a splurge, so hey, cleric's back on his feet.  The final puzzle involves recounting phrases found in a room that the party had skipped, and this was practically right at our hard stop time.  Would've been totally lame to end it there with no resolution, a riddle to be solved, so I basically gave it to the party.  After the sesh, felt like I went a little to easy on the players, but we all had a blast anyway.  Everyone was hyped to kill the wyrm next sesh.

&#x200B;

Session 3,  I rule the near death experience left the cleric with -1 to Con.  The party visited most of the remaining locations they had skipped, glossing over the giant's house and the goblin keep.  They get the wine, assemble a spread of goat meat and bread to lure out the wyrm, get it drunk, and slay it.  The other PC's character went negative in this fight too, but the cleric made it to him within seconds to heal with their recently learned cure light wounds.  Didn't feel fair at all to have that character die, and no time was wasted to restore him, so it seemed reasonable.  PCs make it back to town with the hoard and party it up.

&#x200B;

Review:

Great module for a first game with new/long-time-out-of-the-game players, it's just classic DnD, done well.  My players didn't get too involved in the NPC antics (minor plot hole- there's really no reason any of the NPC's in town couldn't just stay up late one night to find the sources of all their problems) but it provided enough life to make the scenario feel fresh, yet still pure tabletop fantasy rpg.  The dungeon was fun and just the right size and danger level to not feel like a slog.  Would I give rumors for this setting to a seasoned group or established campaign?  Maybe not, it's maybe just a tad too vanilla.  But I really enjoyed this and would totally recommend it for a session 1 module for a new or experienced DM.",osr,1676952510.0,1,3685,682

It's just the front cover of the zine, and it's made by a machine learning algorithm, I think trained on 2e-era TSR stuff. I think it's gorgeous. Reminds me of my old '80s Lord of the Rings paperbacks from Ballantine. 

The zine is 24 pages long, including the front and back cover (which are, oddly, both in the front) and two pages of boilerplate.  Pages are A5 with something like 12 point font inside. Might be written in LaTeX, I'm not sure, but the justification is pretty good. The text inside is breezy and reads easily. So you don't get a ton of content for your money, but, luckily, the zine is almost certainly coming to you for free, as it's against the terms of its copywrite to sell it -- the zine is primarily distributed through trades and acts of service.

Now to the meat of the thing.

We begin with a pretty unexceptional overview of the concept of name level. Basically, a high-level D&D character has two options: become a superhero or play the domain game. A character who plays the domain game has a lot of new options open to them, but will also be significantly restricted by the duties of running a domain, so the choice isn't obvious.

If you want to play the domain game, you need a Name. You can get a Name by default when you hit a high enough level ""Name Level"", as per standard D&D -- for instance level 9 for fighting-men in OD&D. Or, Eero adds, you can inherit the name or acquire all its accoutrements in some other way. So if you're the heir of a Lord, and he dies, you become the Lord of his domain, no matter what level you are. Or, if you conquer a domain, you become a Lord, no matter what level you are. I think most GMs will have instituted something like this in their own campaigns -- I know I have -- but it's good to see it formalized.

We then get a few brief mechanisms governing Names. They're really light and unobjectionable. Names soak up XP and have their own ranks separate from character levels, and they give you some bonus HP and bonuses to Name-related tasks. Easy enough, in theory. The specific tasks are left vague and situational, which is one of the hallmarks of Eero's writing. This will either really appeal to you, or turn you off immediately. He's more interesting in a flexible chassis for further experimentation than in a finished set of rules that practically play themselves. Anybody interested in using the CWPs will have to do a *lot* of work themselves to figure out how to model the world. The CWPs are simply tools to help someone model, and the fruits of prior modelling. They are not a DMG. They really are ""partial"".

Following this is a brief (lots of brevity here!) account of the ways a player might customize their Name as they advance through ranks, and the different kinds of Names different classes characteristically have. Again, this is more of a starting-point for experimentation on the part of the player and GM than a finished list of options. But it's a very compelling starting point.

Then comes a section on what the Named character actually does. This is a bit of a whiff, because it really just says ""See my other work on modelling a domain, and the things the leader of a domain might get up to"". I don't have the CWP on domains, so I can't comment on it. Luckily, I think the system presented in *this* CWP is abstract, flexible, *and* concrete enough that you could bolt it on to any domain system you can think of. For instance, it could replace ""Champion Levels"" or whatever they're called in *An Echo, Resounding* by Kevin Crawford.

We end with two new classes: the Courtier and the Officer (which is actually a hybrid of the Courtier and the Fighter -- does the Officer get all the benefits of each at every equivalent level? How do hybrid classes work? This isn't a standard term.). They specialize in running the show for a Name in a domain, and actually require the backing of a Name to be functional. All their different abilities seem well thought-out and functional. I can imagine a player rolling up lots of Courtier NPCs when they need to get things done. It's not obvious, though, that anybody would want to *play* a Courtier or an Officer, or that they could effectively play one and still go on standard D&D adventures. This too is a divisive feature about Eero's work. He's more interested in modelling things, and seeing what happens, than creating a fun and balanced challenge where every listed option is viable. If it turns out that nobody can rack up more than 500 XP as a Courtier, he'll be happy having learned that. Will you be happy having spent a few sessions earning that XP as a Courtier, only to abandon the adventuring lifestyle for three months to oversee bridge construction? (I would, but I'm not everyone.)

In sum, this is an interesting but not totally substantial piece. There are few surprises but a decent amount of advice in an area where most of us are inexperienced. Anybody who was interested in doing a bit (or a lot) of legwork to enrich their domain game could view this as a potential starting-point, and it could complement any number of domain systems.",osr,1704502885.0,1,5683,993

1538,132,1albhuz,"""Druid Class"" by Eero Tuovinen -- a review","""Coup de Main in Greyhawk"" is an in-progress campaign and an in-progress rule system by Eero Tuovinen, author of [Muster](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/413382/muster).  He is publishing the design notes for his system in a series of pamphlet-sized PDFs called Coup Workbook Partials, CWPs for short. They are not intended to be immediately playable; they really are *design notes*, useful for spurring further thought in the reader. Two of Coup's design goals are relevant for this review: first, that all character optimization be a matter of fictional positioning, and second, that different magic-using classes play differently.

This is a review of  one of his most recent CWPS, #18, Druid Class. A disclaimer: I got the  PDF for free in exchange for agreeing to review it.

First, the art:

[Back and front cover of CWP 18: Druid Class by Eero Tuovinen](https://preview.redd.it/jgt6xjhsl7hc1.png?width=1389&format=png&auto=webp&s=b60d9f8264212caf2b4a3e46f534ba83f8730874)

I think it's gorgeous, quite evocative. AI-generated, if you care about that, using Stable Diffusion trained on 2e-era TSR art by the writer's brother. The druid's toes are maybe a little too long, but maybe we could read that generously as an effect of his physical cultivation?

The pdf is 28 pages long, of which 4 pages are boilerplate. The remainder are, at a guess, a5, 12 point font, written in Eero's typical breezy style. You could skim through it easily and arrive at a solid grasp of the class, or slow down and really mull things over.

We begin with a three-page summary of the history and organization of the druids and their beliefs. It's not very detailed, just a picture of things. While it's Greyhawk-specific, you shouldn't have trouble understanding how Eero's vision of the druid would or wouldn't fit into your campaign world, and what changes would have to be made. I'm no Greyhawk scholar, but I found the material forceful and game-ready. Though this section, and the later discussion of necromancy and the death force, open a modeling question for the referee: Druids believe *this*, and others believe *that*, but what should the referee believe, and use to model the world? -- Maybe this question can be deferred indefinitely in some cases, but the referee will certainly have to decide if, for instance, there really is a death force, and how the druids have missed it if there is one, and how the necromancers are able to make magic if there isn't one.

The entire next page is devoted to the druid's progression chart. Nothing much sticks out here. There's some Coup-specific idioms, but these can be ignored or pursued further as the reader pleases. I have a quibble with the druid's spell slots, though; as written, they only go up to spell level 4! A druid does have ways to cast spells without slots, so they're not exactly hamstrung by the change. Still, I wonder why Eero chose this spell progression.

Then we spend 5 pages explaining the unique class features of the druid. The organization here is a bit wonky, though it makes sense after the whole document has been read. Each class feature gets a tiny brief, and then, to be expanded upon in the next section, on druidic magic. Until you've read the next section, you won't be able to make heads nor tails of most of this.

A few little comments: I would have liked more information on what having an elemental affinity for life would do for somebody on its own. A druid develops this affinity by becoming a more powerful druid, casting spells, transforming stuff, whatever, but what does a non-druid do with it? Or just a level 1 druid? Is it just a constant ""detect life aura""?

Some of the features are really interesting and cool, and make sense in the (implied and explicit) model. For instance, when a higher-level druid is connected to the stream of life force, they're immune to charm (and falling in love) because their soul is suppressed. Also, such a druid has control over the fate of their spirit after death. They can become a ghost or reincarnate themselves.

Then we get the meat of the document, the explanation of druidic magic. Basically, druids have control over life, just like a fire elementalist has control over fire, but they intentionally restrict themselves to a slow and ""natural"" flow of power. Druids can take a lot of time meditating to transform the living world around them. They can do practically anything that makes sense as an application of ""transforming the flow of the life force"", but if a player wants suggestions for the different maneuvers possible, they can check out the druid's AD&D 1e spell list. Druids can also store these transformations in their spell slots, which they can unleash rapidly, as a normal Vancian caster, though each slot takes one day per spell level to fill. Finally, druids can transform themselves into animals, and there's a quick and easy formula for the difficulty of the procedure.

When druids transform the life stream, they sit in mediation for a while and make a number of concentration checks based on their level and the difficulty of the transformation (and the suggested difficulty is the spell level of the transformation, again, presumably in AD&D 1e). We are not told exactly what a concentration check is; presumably roll d20 under Wisdom? If this is so, druidic magic is extremely dangerous! Any single failure ruins the spell and deals 1d8 damage per spell level, spread between the caster, target, and environment. I want to know what the intended difficulty is here. Should we give bonus dice for a quiet environment or something?

There's a cool discussion of druid politics and ""black druidry"", which is any kind of druidry that doesn't totally align with the normal druidic standards. Basically, treating the life force like a fire elementalist treats fire is bad, as is conspiring with demons and stuff.

We end on a discussion of the druidic social structure, accompanied by a very obscure diagram and some really actionable, game-y material. If a player wants to be a druid and stay on the right side of the white druids, they're going to have to toe the line and dig deep into druidic politics. If not, well, they can always be a black druid, but they'll miss the deep mechanical benefits of druid society and they'll be hunted on sight by white druids.

\### Conclusion

I found this CWP easy to read, evocative, and stimulating. I fully intend to offer it to my play group as the default druid class. There's plenty of blank space in the class design -- my work as the referee will not be ""done"" just because I have read this, and I expect to have to create some understanding of the life stream and elemental magic in my game if I'm going to use it. But I have strong confidence that the rewards will be worth it.

I recommend this to anyone interested in getting their hands dirty with a more in-depth treatment of magic in their game, and anyone who wants an innovative take on a familiar class.",osr,1707334549.0,1,6981,1179

(Here's hoping the new layout will fix that, and thankfully the referee screen is also going to be available again.) There's something to be taken from SW:C and OD&D you won't get as much of from BX or OSE, though: the Old School DIY spirit.

***The pdf of SW:C is free, but you'd have to read through it to get all the gold nuggets. What follows are a few of those gold nuggets.***

&#x200B;

>…in the 1970s, no group of gamers played precisely the same version of the Original Game anyway. The ‘70s was a decade of freaky improvisation, weird fantasy, and rebellion. And that’s Swords & Wizardry. If that’s how you roll, all the rest is just details.  
>  
>The Swords & Wizardry rules are short compared to the multi-paged rule-libraries required to play most modern role-playing games, yet this game contains within itself all the seeds and soul of mythic fantasy, the building blocks of vast complexity, the kindling of wonder. The Original Game is so powerful because it is encapsulated i n a small formula, like a genie kept imprisoned in the small compass of an unremarkable lamp. Take this framework, and then imagine the hell out of it!  
>  
>Enjoy!  
>  
>Matt Finch

You can see this emphasis on imagination and customization in OD&D:

>There is no reason that players cannot be allowed to play as virtually anything, provided they begin relatively weak and work up to the top, i.e., a player wishing to be a Dragon would have to begin as, let us say, a “young” one and progress upwards in the usual manner, steps being predetermined by the campaign referee...  
>  
>We have attempted to furnish an ample framework, and building should be both easy and fun. In this light, we urge you to refrain from writing for rule interpretations or the like unless you are absolutely at a loss, for everything herein is fantastic, and the best way is to decide how you would like it to be, and then make it just that way! On the other hand, we are not loath to answer your questions, but why have us do any more of your imagining for you? Write to us and tell about your additions, ideas, and what have you. We could always do with a bit of improvement in our refereeing.

Some OD&D aficionados argue that the DIY mindset is reinforced by the sparse rules that require referee ruling on the spot. Others (myself included) would argue that it's better to introduce the DIY mindset after the game and its frame work has been introduced.  BX and OSE provide that introduction to the framework. But while BX and OSE certainly encourage imagination and house ruling, they don't provide as much in the way of inspiration.

Take OSE's description of the fighter, a perfect brief summary:

>Fighters are adventurers dedicated to mastering the arts of combat and war. In a group of adventurers, the role of fighters is to battle monsters and to defend other characters.

Compare it to Finch's long-winded description:

>You are a warrior, trained in battle and in the use of armor and weapons. Perhaps you are a ferocious Viking raider, a roaming samurai, a dashing swashbuckler, a deadly swordswoman, or a chivalrous knight. Whatever type of Fighter you choose to play, you will probably end up on the front lines of your adventuring party—going toe-to-toe with dragons, goblins, and evil cultists, hacking your way through them and taking the brunt of their attacks. The Fighter character is best-equipped of all the character classes to dish out damage and absorb it, too. Clerics heal and Magic-Users cast spells, but the down-and-dirty, hack-and-slash work is generally up to you. You are going to serve as the party’s sword and shield, protecting the weaker party members and taking down the enemies before you. Perhaps one day they will tell legends of your battle prowess, and followers will flock to your castle stronghold where you revel in your fame, riches, and newly earned nobility. Fail, of course, and you will die, just another forgotten warrior in a dangerous world. It should go without saying that female Fighters are as deadly and as skillful as their male counterparts – and in the fantasy worlds of Swords & Wizardry, they are also much more common than in the history of our own world.

This kind of writing is all over the place in SW:C (except for the description of Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings--Finch apparently took it to heart that OD&D's world is to be a human dominated one). Most rule books don't introduce their material this way, which is understandable when everyone knows what a magic-user or a dwarf is. But by going out of his way, Finch provides an example of the kind of wonder you can infuse into the game.

I think Gavin Norman's legacy with OSE is not going to be in OSE itself, but rather in *the idea of such fantastic layout*. After all, these rules are made to be house-ruled half to hell, which makes a reference copy only so useful in the long run. Likewise, I think Finch's legacy with Swords & Wizardry is not the game itself, but the inspiration he provides within. Or, as he puts it: *Imagine the hell out of it!*

***Now, time for some of the less important but still notable quotes from SW:C, what you might call the silver nuggets:***

Finch gives some inspiration for upper level play, including performing wondrous feats of magic:

>Eventually, the more powerful characters will begin to make a mark on the game world itself. They may take control of a castle, build armies, and even, if the game goes on long enough and the group decides not to retire the characters, name kingdoms after themselves or venture into other worlds, realms, or dimensions. Perhaps they will do battle with demon princes, maybe they will forge artifacts of great power—even unite great empires through diplomacy in grand courts or beneath their banners on the field of war. Later “generations” of characters might even be serving as henchmen for the old, retired heroes of the game!...  
>  
>As the characters reach higher levels, the players will most likely want them to begin projects that are not specifically covered by the rules. Perhaps the Magic-User wants to build an army of magically animated iron warriors, but needs to figure out how to do it. Maybe the Fighter wants to establish a small, fortified manor in the wilderness hills, but needs to hire some troops and clear out the area. This side of the game is limited only by your collective imaginations. Of course, as the heroes become better known (or more notorious), they will be petitioned for help by all manner of people from kings to peasants, and they will hear of mysterious places and rumors far beyond the normal fare of less-renowned adventurers.  
>  
>...if you take a look at those spell lists, you will see that the list of 6th-level Magic-User spells includes one called Limited Reincarnation, and the 5th-level Cleric spells include Raise Dead. These are pinnacle-type spells; you do not really need to power them up any further with Reincarnation and Resurrection. So, this author, as a Referee, does not use the higher level spells – at least, not as spells.  
>  
>Instead, all the higher-level spells are treated as the same sort of thing as creating a golem or a cloud castle, or some other type of magical project that would require doing research, finding books, and spending gold. There are books to be found and studied, expensive arcane components to locate, particular times of the year or lunar cycle when the magic can be performed, runes to know, circles to scribe, and other strange and forbidden knowledge to be researched.  
>  
>These things are bigger than mere spells that can be cast multiple times a day. For example, to summon a supernatural being, a Magic-User must use the right magic circle to hold a being of a particular name or type, and that requires research into forbidden tomes, which are likely located in a dungeon or ruin somewhere. To “cast” Resurrection (on someone who has been dead too long for a Raise Dead spell), a Cleric might have to bring the remains to a specific holy place, and seek much more assistance from other Clerics. The possibilities are vast and the author, at any rate, thinks it is more fun to limit the top end of spell power and switch the high-level spells from mere “spells” to serious undertakings of magic, requiring research, adventuring, and the expenditure of huge quantities of gold.

Although never explicitly stated, throughout Finch hints that the game should be run as a good old-fashioned sandbox. The world should be populated with points of interest, and the players should be free to pursue those points of interest at will, or even be allowed to pursue their own interests in the game. Finch also hints at something that he would say explicitly in his Tome of Adventure Design:  *A good adventure should maximize meaningful player decisions.* I'll cheat here, and quote what Finch writes in *Tome:*

>Thus, the cardinal rule of adventure design: seek to maximize the number of meaningful, potentially-informed decisions the players can make during the course of the adventure. By “meaningful,” I mean that the decisions aren’t just trivial options with no real influence on what’s going to happen. And by “potentially-informed,” I mean that the players should have enough information – or the potential to have gotten that information – to make a good decision rather than an arbitrary selection between options. If bad information- gathering or failure to interpret clues is the reason why the players don’t have all the information they need, then that’s their problem – it’s a matter of player skill, and they goofed. But on the other hand, if they play a smart game, brilliantly gathering information and interpreting clues, they should encounter your adventure as a series of choices in which (for the most part) they can use the information to improve their chances of success as they proceed.

There's lots more to talk about in the Tome of Adventure Design, *but that is a post for another day...*

1555,241,1j74efn,Which OSR works best as a 3.0/3.5e replacement?,"Hello everyone, 

I am a forever DM and since my players always played 3.5 thats what I am stuck with.  
As a consequence I only play dnd 3.5 level lock games Lv6-8. Everything above that is just way too much work for me as a DM.

I read a bit into other systems too. PF2e, 5e, Conan, Worlds woithout number, OSR, fate...

One of my players has a huge library of old dnd 3.0-3.5e adventures that we would still like to use.  
  
**So what I am looking for is a system that creates less work for me as a DM compared to 3.5 but has also a better design (buff stacking, imbalance etc) while making it easy to adapt 3.0e or 3.5e adventures into it.**

Is there a system that fits that idea? Basically, a reworked rule set of the old 3.0 to be more modern in general? Which one would you pick?",osr,1741514115.0,1,788,153

1561,27,157om2t,Dark Sun OSE Revamped,"
Greetings everybody! 
I am hereby to share my revamped versions of the Dark Sun OSE conversion that I shared a while back. With these new revisions, I went through all the books and reorganized them in 2, the Player's Handbook and Game Master's Guide, making some clear revisions:
 
1- I added new covers, made by the awesome gentleman Alexandre Henriques, with the important disclaimers that these booklets are only for free distribution and not official in any kind (They are and shall always be free)

2- Made some corrections for typos and other formatting issues that I wasn't able to notice initially.

3- The books are now in A5 format, rather than A4, meaning that this conversion now is set into the OSE format.

4- Minimum additions for the player's handbook, as it includes both the genre rules and psionic and magic booklets combined into one!

5- Major additions for the Game Master's Guide, I included 27 New Magical Items from the Dark Sun setting (Adding to a total of 30) and a Wilderness Feature Generator. Now you can randomly generate natural formations from different categories and combinations, from vegetation, hydrography, relief and many more,  randomly rolled depending on the region of the wilderness you find yourself in.

Once again, thank you for all the support, these additions have made these project all the more exciting personally, and I hope you can use them at your table!

There's been an organized effort coordinated from the official Autarch discord server to jump on any comments in /r/osr that point this out, as well as to signal boost ACKS 2E prior to the kickstarter launch.

The circumstances which led me to ban Zak Smith/Zak Sabbath/Zak S from this subreddit now impel me to enact a ban on mentioning his works. I had (perhaps naïvely) believed that a user ban would be enough, but it seems like he has enough sock puppet accounts or minions to keep his presence alive here, especially as he continues to produce new content. Therefore, posts promoting him or his products will be removed; repeat posters will be banned. Comments mentioning him will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but may be removed and might also result in a user ban.

To be clear: I do not know for a fact that the allegations of abuse against him are true, but they come from multiple sources, and to my knowledge not all of them have been refuted (lawsuits notwithstanding). Even if they had all been disproven, though, the toxic manner of interaction which he and others allied with him employ on other fora is not welcome here.

Also to be clear: this is not censorship. This is the exercise of editorial control. Anyone who is upset by this decision is free to post elsewhere, perhaps in a subreddit of their own making. I made this one, and wish to promote a healthier style of interaction between members.

I do not like taking this action. I don't like restricting discussion, and I don't like singling out one person for censure. But I believe, in the end, it will be best for this community, and if the allegations are true, it is the only respectful decision I can make for the women involved.

This post will be locked, as the decision is not up for discussion.

While super fun, and one of the things I enjoy most - a nice tea brew, a pipe, and some notebooks and pens are pretty much my comfort definition these days for my spare time - it also makes things challenging sometimes. 

My constant need to have things feel “unique” or “different” can lead to more building than playing sometimes, or getting stuck in endless loops of notes I’ll never use! 

To combat this, and just to have some fun on my own, I decided to take another run at  a few classic modules solo between my usual game sessions using B/X and keeping things largely vanilla. 

Not worrying about what’s over that ridge or developing the religion beyond “new gods feel like church, old gods feel like Celtic deities” and somehow not concerning myself with the primordial origins of how dwarves came to be nor the specific hierarchical split of all goblinkind…has been freeing.

1572,57,113nmdm,Dear Mods and OSR Redditors,"Dear Mods and OSR Redditors 

I like this subreddit because it is the closest thing to the old G+ forum. 

On G+ people micro-blogged, people posted discussion topics, and people shared links to their blogs and crowd funding projects. 

All these activities were valued. 

In particular, sharing a blog post showed people something they may or may not have known about and/or liked. If the blog post was not your bag, you simply scrolled past. I never considered sharing a blog post to be “spamming”. That presupposes that the posters are selling that which the users do not want to see. I want to see these blog posts highlighted, to see new things. 

I like to see blog posts effectively rated by up/down votes, it throws light on interesting blog post that I might not have taken an interest in. 

I know there is a subset of redditors that hate blog posts, and only want to have discussions. But, **why are they the most important users on this subreddit?**  

Recently, there seems to be a trend on this subreddit to make this subreddit like all the boring subreddits where the mods are uber-controlling, to make this subreddit like all the other uptight subreddits. 

I don’t think blog post links should be ghettoed to a single thread (and we all know ghettoed threads are where things are sent to die), because some subredditors don’t like those kinds of post. It’s not like I have noticed an abusive amount of blog post. 

Please leave this subreddit as it has been for the last 8 or so years, there was nothing wrong with the permissive, embracive culture. Why mess with the winning formula? 

I guess I’m bringing this seeming change in policy to the fore, and the “we only like discussions posts” brigade will downvote this post hard.

1585,122,11l514k,OSR theory vs reality,"My background: Started playing D&D in 1979 with the Holmes blue box. Played regularly ever since. Witnessed the genesis and growth of the old-school renaissance movement on various forums since it started more than 15 years ago, and participated in many discussions about what made early D&D different from what came later.

And I’m here to tell you that dogma like ‘combat is a fail state in old-school D&D’ is revisionist nonsense. And the fact it gets bandied around so often is proof that the reality of how people played D&D 40 years ago has been eclipsed by theory-craft.

By the time AD&D was published, the great majority of gamers employed a mix of published and home-brew adventures. Adventures like Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, White Plume Mountain, Keep on the Borderlands, and Village of Hommlet flew off the shelves. None of these are mega-dungeons. None of them present a premise of sneaking into a dungeon and liberating it of treasure without alerting the inhabitants. In some cases, putting the inhabitants to the sword to remove a threat to civilization is the whole point of the adventure (G1, the Caves of Chaos). In others (White Plume, Hommlet, the Tower of Zenopus), the scope and layout of the dungeon does not enable the stealthy circumvention of threats.

No, when the party rolled up to the entrance of those dungeons, they were on a search a destroy missions to kill the monsters and take their stuff. Did they use deception and cunning tricks to shift the odds in their favour? Absolutely. Did they retreat from combat when they realized they were in over the heads? For sure. Did many PCs die out of bad play or bad luck? Yep.

But what they did not do is treat combat as a fail state. Rolling dice and killing monsters was the heart of the game, and the default premise of these hugely popular adventures - adventures that taught new players what D&D was about. How Gygax and a few other OGs played in 1975 was already irrelevant to the player-base by 1979. How would we have even known how Castle Greyhawk was run?

It’s cool that the OSR revived old and forgotten play modes and principles. I was part of that early dialogue, when we shared stories of desperate struggles to survive the Caverns of Thracia, or the six-level meatgrinder of a dungeon that our DM in grade 10 made over summer break. And how those experiences contrasted with the heroic, super-powered assumptions of 3.X D&D.

But the message has become garbled and distorted on forums like this, often by people who didn’t play 30+ years ago. Now they’re preaching and enforcing an orthodoxy that would have been absolutely baffling to a bunch of 15 year olds chucking dice in a rec room in the 80s.

Tldr: The OSR principles that get bandied on forums like this are not reflective of how the great majority of people played D&D in the first decade of its publication. They were crafted and championed with the aim of reviving a very narrow approach to play that was - until recently - not widely adopted or even known about.",osr,1678209088.0,1,3028,532

1588,131,woongi,Final Revisions to the Dark Sun OSE conversion,"How is it going everybody? I just completed the revisions to the whole OSE Dark Sun conversion. This is a series of improvements and restructuring and additions to all booklets to make the conversion more appealing to both players and DMs who want to play a Dark Sun Campaign.To begin with, the Conversion is separated in 4 Booklets: The Genre Rules (Previously called Character Creation), The Dungeon Master's Guide (Previously called Guide for DMs), The Monster Manual and a separate book for Psionic and Magic Rules. All Booklets in the conversion include printing guidelines for printing them in A5 format, their pdfs are bookmarked for ease for reference and all of them have some additions and changes, listed as follows:

* Genre Rules: This one has the least changes overall, I took out the psionics and magic rules and changed them for equipment, followers and stronghold rules, similar to its equivalent in the OSE Box Set.
* Dungeon Master's Guide: This one had the most additions. Basically I added more tools and tips for DMs for how to run a Dark Sun Game, with tips regarding tracking resources, and explanation to the Athasian Calendar, a series of potential adventure and campaign scenarios for inspiration and a lot of random tables, such as: Trinkets, Settlement Generation, City-State Generation, Dungeon Generation and more! I also moved here the appendix L: House Rules, previously present in the Character Creation Booklet, as it was honestly more fitting to be present here. I am also repeating the rules for equipment present in the genre rules, that way both DMs and Players are able to reference weapons and armor easily on the table.
* Monster Manual: This one didn't have much to add, but I added two monster, the Crystal Spyder and the Zhackal, present in the original monster compendium.
* Psionics & Magic: This one had some additions still in regards to methods for defiling (Like defiling while preparing spells rather than during casting) and Obsidian Orbs, a rather bold invention of mine, basically spell batteries that contain energy for spells combined with sith holocrons from Star Wars, I know, of Apocryphal within the Canon, but I couldn't help to add them because I thought they were so cool!

Now, some of you made the question as to when it would be safe to print the booklets, to which I finally say you guys can do it, as I won't be adding anything else to the conversion that I think is important to enjoy the setting to its fullest, or at least not in the foreseeable future. Rather, I'll slowly work in making the big tome that will have everything in just one book, but the only changes within it will be the referencing of pages, table of contents and bookmarking, so rest assured that your print out of this project will not be missing out of anything. I also made a Character Sheet! This is honestly not my strength,  I feel it's rather simplistic, but I still think it is functional and easy to use, I will not be sending it in PDF, rather I'll send it in PPT format, so you easily copy it and fill it with no issues if you are running a game online. Thank you so much for your support, this has been an amazing experience for me, I'll now take my time to start my own athasian campaign and start working on some other projects I am super excited about. Now is your turn, however go out and have the best games you can and enjoy all the excitement the ravaged world of Athas is capable to provide!

Part of the explanation this Thanks comes so belatedly is because I have been (luckily) busy drawing and painting. So this means I’ll be notified that I’ve been tagged in a post somewhere and it’s a person from this community who has taken the time to appreciate what I do, to remember it, and to my eternal gratification: eviscerate the imposter in the comments. I can only offer art in return, so here’s something I did for The Shrike by Leo Hunt and Joel Hines at Silverarm Press… 

It concerns a part of the game where a young girl and an old man live in a forest of tree sized candelabras, and she believes if she can light the limbs of each one she will be freed of her miserable situation… it’s a really tragic and touching part of the module, and I tried my best to depict her Sisyphean task… perhaps we can extend this to be analogous to the work of this community, trying to keep the lights on in an ever increasingly dim world….

1595,152,1hsv5j3,The Highest Level of All,"Fantasy Wargaming is an oddity in my collection. Despite its title, it's not a wargame but an RPG.

About ten years ago, a fellow on a facebook Old School RPG sale page offered it for free, with the buyer paying postage. I had never heard of it before, was curious, so I took it off his hands.

I've flipped through it several times over the years, and read various sections, but this past holiday season, I decided give it a read-through and see if there was anything worth lifting for the OSR campaign I'm writing.

Strangely, Fantasy Wargaming is a novel-sized book rather than the usual oversized RPG publication. Somehow, that makes the rules more difficult to digest; I'm not sure why. There are very few illustrations, but lots and lots of charts and graphs.

The first 100 pages is lore and history; the author draws on various time periods and cultures. Next, is a long article about the fantasy works that inspired his vision: mainly Moorcock and Vance, but plenty of others.

After that, a long section on character creation (one of the photos is a sample character sheet), and a long section on gameplay. Finally, more info on the world.

There are a lot of good ideas here, but every idea sinks under cumbersome and/or too many rules. Creating a character alone might take an entire afternoon. Combat rules have almost too many variations, covering too many situations. Magic is similar. I almost wonder if anyone ever played this game, and if the game is playable at all!

1604,183,ws3rsc,Why you should splurge and get OSR print products,"You are possibly aware that a new version of 5e is dropping, called One D&D. They are eliminating the concept of an ""edition"" in favor of continuously updating rules, offering an online ecosystem of virtual tabletop services, and revising the core books. They're suggesting it's the last edition of D&D.

I know a lot of people here don't care about WotC D&D, but what I'm interested in thinking about is where WotC D&D is headed and what that means for TTRPG people who've opted out of their Great Reset.

To understand what's happening, it helps to look at academia. Publishers realized their biggest competition was the previous editions of their own books: Students would buy used copies, even of previous editions that were ""similar enough"". In order to make lots of filthy lucre, the publishers realized it wasn't enough to just change chapter titles and shuffle content around. Now they ""rent"" books and put content online behind subscription paywalls. Why? To limit competition. This is anti-competitive. It's about money. It's a way to force people to pay more for their products. Think Microsoft Office365.

Why is WotC doing what they're doing? They are embracing the ""product-as-a-service"" model and eliminating the competition from their own past book releases (as well as vertically integrating the whole online ttrpg experience to eat Roll20 et al's lunch). The point is that 5e is too big and well established to ""kill"" in one shot with a new 6e, so they have to move that massive player base to a new model while simultaneously making the existing 5e books obsolete. They are transitioning D&D to a model where there are no books or terrain or dice and everything is on your device. You get an account, you log in, everyone has their virtual table top open. There is nothing in meatspace. No dice, no pencils or paper, no books, no minis. You will be able to get the books for a few more cycles (7-10 years), and after that they will be ""deluxe slipcase"" editions for like $300 or a starter box set that is mostly about getting people acclimated to the online product. But no one will play D&D as an ""analog"" tabletop game anymore.

So once a sufficient number of people are plugged in to this new product, they'll quietly stop with the books. Why publish books? A $30-50 book sits on your shelf forever. The d&d service will be, whatever, $8-15 a month plus the texture packs and add-ons and supplementary content. That's more money a year than a copy of the PHB anyway, which you can resell (of course, most 5e players don't read it anyway, so what do they care if it gets taken away?). Enjoy renting your hobby, forever, you poor sucker.

Even if I'm wrong and WotC wants to keep a robust publishing business going in principle, the post-5e crowd is going to be functionally and mechanically illiterate because they will spend all their time relying on the app and the DM to offer their choice sets and resolve outcomes. Demand for the books will dry up, and WotC will be OK with that: Newspapers don't really want to print the things anymore, either, except at exorbitant rates.

You know the 3.5"" floppy icon that is used as the ""save"" symbol in lots of software, even though no one has used a floppy disk in decades? You're going to have a button that looks like a 20-sided die, you press it, and a random number occurs, and young people will be like, ""What is that funny looking icon?"" 

I am pointing this out to say, please buy print OSR products. First, the creators benefit from your support. But the ""OSR"" experience might increasing refer not just to the rules system or play experience but to the physical reality of the experience. Dice, pencils, paper, minis, humans looking at each other, books. A real shared experience that isn't a commercialized thing intermediated by WotC but a spontaneous and creative experience. Whether you use theater-of-the-mind or minis, that's about to vanish with D&D in the next 5 to 10 years, and D&D is like 90% of the ttrpg market.

If you own the book, no one can take it from you. No one can quietly change your digital copy because they don't like the mechanics or ideas. It's a piece of real art that you can appreciate in a world where everything is disposable and companies see it as their right to edit culture whenever it's profitable or convenient for them to do so.

In the future, digital things will die constantly. They will be even more disposable than the cheap plastic garbage that has flooded our lives and environment. D&D rules will become an ever-changing set of patch notes of nonsense. Competing products will rise up and die out and nothing will mark their coming or going, like so many dead digital worlds whose servers have been shut off forever.

But if you have the book, it was real. It happened. And it can happen again, just the way the author intended and the way you remember. You just need some dice and friends and imagination.

1622,253,10ueymv,Opinion: D&D Forgets It's Horror Roots,"Sword & Sorcery was often horror with swords.  The authors were contemporaries and friends of Lovecraft and even used and expanded on his lore in their works.  Conan faced unimaginable creatures that shattered the mind to think about.  Robert E Howard and Clark Ashton Smith were writing the same stuff as Lovecraft, just in a different setting.  This was what Arneson and Gygax grew up reading.

The first fantasy game that would become D&D was conceived by Dave Arneson after a weekend of watching horror movies.

The first players to enter the first dungeon walked a little way in, heard some disturbing noises, said ""Oh, hell no!"" and ran out.

A dungeon is a horror movie more than a fantasy movie. It is dark and it should be terrifying.  Role playing is mostly about the actions a character does in these very dangerous situations, not the voices.  I think play loses a lot of flavor when the horror element is lost and the players aren't behaving as terrified individuals would in that situation.

My idea of a perfect dungeon crawl moment is the beginning of ""Aliens"".  They walk in cocky and then drive out petal-to-the-metal screaming and don't stop until someone pries Ripley's fingers off the accelerator.  That's a moment your players will never forget.

I’m just talking about how it feels - it might be that in a few months or years, handmade art has just become a niche product or a luxury item…that feels like a major potential bummer. Seriously.

A little over a year ago, first-hand accounts of abuse of women by Zak Sabbath/Zak S/Zak Smith appeared in various places over the web. This has led to at least one lawsuit, but, to my knowledge, not all of the accusations have been refuted. I do not claim to know the veracity of these accusations, but they come from multiple sources and are not, on the face of it, unbelievable. Due to an overabundance of caution, then, I made the difficult decision to ban Zak from this forum, a ban which remains in place today.

**But, to get to the point:** regardless of whether or not the accusations are true, posts about someone being sued by Zak are not ""industry news""; the OSR is only barely an ""industry"", for one thing. For another, and more importantly, announcements about someone paying Zak S money do not help anyone play their games. They do not lead to productive discussions, nor do I see any indication that they have changed anyone's mind on the subject. Therefore, any such posts will be deleted from hereon in. Anyone making multiple attempts to post them will be banned.

On a related note, any ""I owe Zak S an apology"" posts will be deleted if the person posting it did not make an accusation on this subreddit.

Anyone accusing me of fascism is welcome to create their own blog or subreddit praising Zak S to the high heavens. If you do, please pay close attention when jackbooted thugs do *not* break down your door and arrest you. But note also that using such abusive language is a bannable offense.

1654,375,12tots7,Why I replace the d20 with 3d8 in every d20 system I run.,"I originally implemented this houserule last year as part of a combat overhaul I was writing for 5e. I’ve since come to use it in any d20 system I run, and it has a huge number of benefits (many geared more toward OSR) that I wanted to share for others to consider or even try. As a disclaimer: I’m not saying this way is better, despite how much I prefer it, or that using a d20 is somehow worse. Every table runs things differently, and it’s hard to exaggerate the d20’s success in ttrpg. But, this simple replacement changes the feel of a game so drastically, I have to put forth an argument for it.

# The 3d8 engine:

* Any time you make a check that requires a d20, roll 3d8 instead, using the sum as your base roll and adding modifiers like normal. Positive circumstances or ‘advantage’ adds a d8, negative circumstances or ‘disadvantage’ subtracts a d8.
* For attacks, every natural 8 rolled adds a damage die, and two or more natural 8s trigger “critical” effects (automatic hits, status conditions, etc). If you’d like, you can say 2 or more natural 1s trigger fumbles as well.
* To compensate for the higher average roll, add between +2 and +4 to all target numbers/DCs (I do +2, more might be suitable to your table).

# The math:

Here’s what this does to the probabilities (skip this part if you don’t care about the math).

* Most importantly it turns the flat 5% distribution for any roll into a bell curve, where middle or average rolls are more likely, while rolls at the highest and lowest ends of the range are less likely.
* It gives you a wider range of rolls (3 to 24), and increases the average roll from 10.5 to about 13.5.
* There’s a 3 in 8 chance of getting some extra damage, but a 3 in 64 chance of a crit (plus a little extra with the \~1% from rolling all 8s), ~~about 4.8%~~ \[edit:  ≈4.3%, thank you u/emarsk\] (very close to the original 5%).

# What this does to your game:

The first and greatest factor is an increase in **player agency**, directly due to the bell curve distribution of rolls. With a normal d20, your +2 or +5 or whatever modifier can very easily be washed out by an unlucky roll. You need a very large modifier to be sure of your ability to tackle larger challenges, which is why games like 5e require so many buffs and bonuses to give players confidence to run their characters. With more consistent, average dice rolls, **your players will develop a more natural intuition of what they can do and expect from their stats**.

However, with the extra swingyness of damage from every d8, **combat becomes more exciting and engaging**, despite most rolls being more consistent. Furthermore, it makes it more **deadly** (read: risky and exciting!) because of the higher overall damage output from both sides. **Martials get a much needed buff** next to their spellcasting counterparts, and spellcasters aren’t as powerless when they run out of spells.

DMs can also **more easily predict and control the difficulty of their encounters** without a string of bad (or very good) luck derailing the fight (as often at least). Also, advantage and disadvantage change both the average and the range, making them much more tactically significant, and affect the amount of maximum extra damage dice you may receive on natural 8s/crits. This all gives DMs more control both when prepping and on the fly.

Lastly, **character progression feels more significant**. With a d20, getting another +1 to a stat moves only the range, but you’re barely more likely to roll a higher roll than you were before because every number in that range is just as likely. By moving the peak of your bell curve, your +1 matters more because those higher DC checks are much more consistent now.

# Preemptive rebuttals:

*Why not 2d10?* The bell curve is stronger with more dice, and crits would become very rare for rolling two 10s, and remove the chances of triple or quadruple damage. (You might find this beneficial and do this instead.)

*Why not 3d6 or 4d6?* I found the crit chances to be far too swingy on d6s, but you might want that and are free to use d6s instead.

*What about my favorite hand carved unicorn horn d20 I sold my car for?* You can still use a d20 for completely random things like initiative or death saves (if using those things). I’ve even been suggested that spellcasters use a d20 to preserve the unpredictability of the arcane.

*Doesn’t adding up more numbers every roll take up more time?* It does, and I’ve noticed the effect to be more extreme for newer players, but you get used to it. I think the benefits are worth the learning (bell) curve (budum tss), and I’ve even introduced this system to people entirely new to ttrpg with little complaint.

*What about \[insert some math knowledge here\], your numbers are wrong!* Look, I’m not here to write a math thesis, I’m here to play ttrpgs with my friends. Regardless of the exact percentages, the feel of my games are changed in a way that works better for how I run them. I’m much more interested in hearing about how you tried it and the effects it had than arguing about math on the internet. I’m sure something I said about the math somewhere was off, I did my best to double check my numbers, but months of playtesting has made me confident in how the game itself is affected and that’s what I’m really posting about. **I welcome polite corrections to my math**, I want them even, but I’ve seen people get very rude over it, so please do so kindly.

Let me know what you think, and best wishes to anyone brave enough to endure my drivel of a write up.

1658,381,y6i3sx,My 5E Group Hated OSE - a post mortem.,"I'm pretty bummed out right now. After just 3 sessions I am pulling the plug on a new OSE campaign I started with friends just last month.  I'm not really sure the point of this post except to share my experience and some lessons learned.

I'd been wanting to run an OSE campaign for awhile but my friends love 5E and had no interest in it. A few of them adamantly said they will play nothing else but 5E.  ""Why do we need to learn a new system?"" was the common response.  I finally got to a point where I decided to just say ""hey, here's what I'm running... join if you'd like to.""  This was probably the first mistake but I was actually somewhat successful as people were interested in playing more D&D and so I sold it as this is D&D but an older version with lighter rules (more rulings, less rules).  The ""5E or nothing"" friends passed on it but I did get a few friends to commit to playing.

The campaign was set in the Wilderlands of High Fantasy and I scattered a bunch of level 1-2 dungeons (Hole in the Oak, Incandescent Grottoes) and mega-dungeons (Castle Xyntillan) around a local area of the map.  I put a couple plot hooks out there to lead the players to the dungeons.  This is where things started to fall apart.  This group in particular had very little player agency and they immediately became paralyzed by the number of choices.  Coming from 5E, they expected me to clue them in on the ""best"" choice.  They wanted me to spoon feed them the optimal choice.  This was the first sign that this wasn't going to work.

Eventually they chose a quest that would bring them to the Hole in the Oak dungeon. However, as luck would have it, they took a path through the dungeon that caused them to awaken the Spectral Hunter and Hounds as their first combat encounter (an extremely hard undead monster for 1st levels).  I emphasized running away and this being a nearly impossible fight at this level.  They made it out alive (shields were shattered) but this left an incredibly bad taste in their mouth.  This was definitely another big mistake on my part. Looking back, I probably shouldn't have triggered this encounter.  I did roll on the reaction table and gave the party a chance to negotiate a way out before combat began but everything went against the players that I felt I had to go through with the combat.  This group really did not like unbalanced encounters or the difficulty involved.  They were not prepared for the difficulty level.  When people say old school D&D is like Dark Souls, they ain't lying.

The next session the party went back to town and had to ""lick their wound"".  They hated how long it took to heal (spending a full day resting to recover 1d3).   They had burned a lot of resources (torches, rations, splintered shields) exploring the dungeon and had very little to show for it.    They sold what little treasure they did find and then had to replenish their supplies.  They started complaining about the mundane activities at this point... managing rations... managing torches... retainers.  They hated all of it.  They did not care for the micromanagement aspect at all or the verisimilitude that these systems provide. Planning for the adventure was not fun to them. They wanted to get straight to the adventure/dungeon and the narrative.

Wilderness travel was a mixed bag with them actively disliking the mechanics of it  (weather, checking lost chance, encounters, eating rations).  One friend commented that if they actually get lost and they spend a whole session wandering aimlessly he would quit.   At this point I realized that they all had no interest in ""emergent"" gameplay and really just wanted me to hand a narrative story/adventure to them.   Even when cool randomly generated map features came up they didn't bother to explore them and instead stuck to the ""quest""/narrative.  They stayed on the rails even though I was giving them a sandbox.

After this last session,  everyone had just about had enough.  The OSR play style was not jiving with them.  One by one they all agreed it was not for them and tapped out.  I've come to realize that this is a very passive group from a player agency perspective and they really want the narrative, on rails story to be handed to them for them to respond to rather then driving it themselves.  To me, this is the biggest difference between OSR games and 5E.  The play style is remarkably different and I understand that now.

This is both for the benefit of would-be promoters, and for us the mods, so we don't get overwhelmed by ""this is spam"" alerts for things that aren't really spam.

Communities like this exist in part because there are products for it, and products exist in part because there is a chance of a (probably small) profit from them, and profits exist in part because people know of the product, so, with that in mind, here are **The Rules:**

1. You are allowed to announce your blog or product *once*. An exception can be made for things like, e.g., Kickstarter, for an announcement within 48 hours of the funding deadline or once the product has funded. (EDIT: or contact the mods if you are uncertain.)

2. You must make a full disclosure that you are promoting your own work *in the post title*, such as ""I put up my new adventure on drivethrurpg"", or ""I have a new blog, I hope you like it"".

3. It would be best if you already have a presence here on /r/osr, but second best would be to become a regular, making productive posts and comments about works or ideas that *aren't* your own stuff. This is a fuzzy rule, I understand, but if the *only* things we see from someone are self-promotions, there is a good chance subsequent entries will be blocked, or the user will be banned.

4. This should go without saying, but the work must be germane to the topic of OSR-style gaming.

5. Feel free to post updates to your blog weekly, but no more frequently than that.

1670,435,10pj3o1,Labyrinth Lord 2.0 is changing into a completely different beast now!,"Interesting developments in **Labyrinth Lord 2e**. According to Dr. Dan Proctor in the LL2e Private FB Group:   

>""One of the things I said a few months back is that **Labyrinth Lord** doesn't need to be a clone anymore. The situation is different than in 2007. There are many clones. There's no need to preserve the old rules.  
>  
>**Labyrinth Lord**'s path ahead is expanding beyond being a clone. To offer an interpretation that is more of myself, not constrained by someone else's canon.  
>  
>The **OGL** issue that's been on all of our minds has made that vision clearer. I'll be releasing 2e as a stand alone game, not connected to the **OGL**. Since I wanted more breathing room for LL anyway, this has benefited the project. It will be a game to play or take ideas from for other **B/X** games.  
>  
>**Labyrinth Lord 2e** will have procedure and rule differences, new and/or completely reworked spells, and totally different presentation of monsters. Those that overlap **B/X** are mostly rewritten to be closer to their folk origins, sometimes deviating in my own way. **All magic items, with some exceptions, are completely replaced in 2e.**  
>  
>Character classes are similar to B/X, with some notable differences. **Clerics are removed, their spells were replaced or reworked and folded into all of the spells. Some spells didn't make the cut, so don't have analogs. So the new classes are brownies, elf-like people that average 4' to 4.5' tall, who combine elements of spell casters and thieves. And cyclops, large people with one eye. Very tough fighters, kind of filling a barbarian role. The other classes are intact, if tweaked.**  
>  
>I've now finished writing and reworking analogs of all spells from **LL** and **AEC**. This number of spells opens the possibility of specialist mages.  
>  
>My goal when you read **Labyrinth Lord 2e** is to make you feel like you're rediscovering the game. **Monsters don't do what you expect them to. Spells are familiar but different. Magic items are different and have a different personality.** Classes are similar but you have some more options.  
>  
>Now I continue to edit and rewrite the rules. I will probably add some more magic items and monsters, maybe a few spells. I'm hoping to have a playtest draft ready in February. I don't want to rush that, especially because this is more than just a revision. So odds are we're looking at a Q2 release.""",osr,1675125095.0,1,2425,409
1671,439,us0829,"I've never had more fun playing DND in my life, and I have no one to gush with.","While I was always interested in DND, I never got the chance to play until a friend introduced me to 5e 5 or 6 years ago. Since then I've run 3 full-length campaigns with the same loyal friends. like many of you, though, I'm sure, I've become burnt out with the Mary Sue archetypes and the bloated, boring combat.

Recently a group of coworkers expressed interest in playing DND, and I knew this was my chance.   


I introduced them to OSE. We hung out, had some beers, rolled 3D6 down the line, and everyone was into it. I took a tip from RuneHammer and explained to them that this was a sacred ritual; a right of passage for all true table-top gamers. We had a BLAST making characters, seeing how the dice would roll.

I used a few dungeons from Gavin as inspiration and crafted my own 1st level OSR tutorial dungeon, complete with giant spiders, deadly traps, naive and helpful kobolds (in exchange for some coin) and a discovery-based narrative that lead to the reawakening of Lolth, the Spider Queen.

Just one coworker was a 5e vet, the other three where total newbies. The 5e vet tried to take a rest after the very first encounter, and I encouraged them to think twice about trying to stay the night in a dangerous dungeon without supplies. Spiders were lurking. They got the point, and from there, it was full immersion.

One of the players got his head caved in immediately. He triggered a trap and failed his save. I felt terrible, he was playing a gentle-giant aspiring botanist  gargantuan. From a previous encounter and skill check it was already clear he was the party's strong man. Seeing his head cave in from one careless step really set the tone, and he was a total champion about it.

We had a spare cleric ready to go and he was back in the game the next room, and he picked up the transition perfectly.

They used problem solving, creativity, cunning, equipment and wits to solve puzzles, disarm traps, ward off giant spiders, and get the treasure. They got their EXP and all 4 of them are ready for more. The 5e vet said he had ""an amazing time.""

1672,440,tt0k5k,Decided to fully embrace the OsR and now I’m playing the best dnd of my life.,"Like a lot of folks I skipped 4th Edition D&D, and returned to the hobby with 5th Edition. It really felt like D&D had returned to its roots and hooked me right back in. Since then I’ve exclusively DM’d 5e and mostly had a blast. Eventually I started to get this nagging feeling that something was missing. I was growing tired of the narrative focused, super heroic style and started yearning for the old school style of adventuring for gold and glory. Like a lot of people I started hacking the system apart trying to find ways to manipulate my players into playing something that honestly they weren’t all that interested in. 

  I eventually learned about the OsR scene, but I just couldn’t commit to some of the, what I considered “antiquated rules”, and ended up playing a watered down version. Of course this didn’t work and I went back to 5e. I once again hacked and slashed until I thought for sure I had the perfect osr 5e experience. I was wrong. It quickly devolved into superheroes but with this time without the narrative that holds it together. I went back to the drawing board and started absorbing everything I could about what made osr tick. I eventually realized that the systems I criticized before like gold as xp had very specific reasons for existing. They completely change player motivations and lead to the exact gameplay experience I was looking for. 

  At this point I was all in. I didn’t just want osr, I wanted the most osr, osr, ever. I wanted Blackmoor. I wanted a large group of players, a massive hex map, and a persistent world with meticulous time keeping. I wanted domain play, high lethality, lack of balance and a focus on exploration. I went to work and built a world. At the same time, like a sign from the dice gods, Questing Beast released a video literally detailing the exact thing I was working on. Anyway this is getting long, so long story short I did it. I now have an open table group of 26 players and growing, (m hoping to hit Gygax’s number of 50 players) and I’m playing the BEST games of dnd I’ve ever experienced.

# Preparing For a Session

## 1. Your first session should start just outside the dungeon entrance

  * __Reason__: Having the first session begin directly outside of the dungeon immediately gives the players a clear objective—explore the dungeon. This lets the session hit the ground running as players will jump immediately into action. Not to mention, this gives your preparation a clear end point.

     * Really, any clear objective and confined location should work since it simplifies prep to one location so the players can immediately jump into the meat of the game.

## 2. Ask what your players will do next session

 * __Reason__: Sessions are best when you have good preparation, so leaving things ambiguous as to what the characters will do session can lead to a lot of wasted prep. Be upfront with your players and say what they decide is what you will prepare, so no changing minds last second. They will understand and it will make your game world all the better.

## 3. Only prepare for the next session

 * __Reason__: Over-prepping is more likely to burn you out than help you. __Broad stroke ideas are enough for hooks to leave your players. They do not need to be fleshed out until they will be encountered in the upcoming session__.

## 4. Sprinkle hooks to adventures liberally around your world. __Each location prepared should have at least one hook to another location__.

 * __Reason__: Doing this will create a web of relationships that make your game world come to life. This will make it easier for players to create their own objectives within the world.

## 5. Factions should have a goal, an obstacle, and a plan to overcome that obstacle.

 * __Reason__: This hits the sweet spot for prepping just enough to have great utility while not over prepping a faction in case your group never interacts with them.

 * Idea from [this GFC DND video](https://youtu.be/-ORbIu5C5UM). All the videos on that channel are well worth watching by the way.


# Dungeon Design

## 1. Follow a Dungeon Checklist for stocking your dungeon
 1. Something to talk to
 2. Multiple routes and branches to explore
 3. Environments that can be altered
 4. Something to kill you
 5. Something to slay
 6. Treasure to take
 7. Something to experiment with
 8. Something hidden


 * Original idea from [Goblin Punch's blog post](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/01/dungeon-checklist.html?m=1)

## 2. Leave hints about other locations within the dungeon

 * __Reason__: This lets the players make intelligent decisions about how they are going to approach exploring the dungeon. You want players to think things like, ""should we follow these scratches or head the other way?"".

## 3. Make sure there are no bland swinging-bags-of-HP style encounters

 * __Reason__: Fights where the players and enemies alternate rolling without making a decision more meaningful than ""I roll to hit the monster"" are boring and undesirable. Don't do this, I'll explain more further down.

# Combat Encounters

## 1. Combats are best kept short and sweet

 * __Reason__: The interesting decisions in a fight tend to be made early in the fight. Once the interesting choices have been made (e.g. PCs/enemies utilizing the environments for an upper hand) then the combat should be nearing a close. 
 * __Roll for morale!__ Your enemies shouldn't want to die. 

## 2. Dynamic environments, enemy tactics, or secondary objectives add a good layer of complexity to what could be an otherwise bland fight.

 * __Environment Example__: Environments that have high potential energy are ideal. Locations that contain a cliff on a battle field, or the threat of a falling rocks trap provide the players/enemies an environmental means of gaining an upper hand.

 * __Enemy Tactics__: A goblin gang might jump the PCs then try to get the players to chase them into an ambush; a team of orcs might target and try to kidnap the smallest member of the party. The point is the enemies have a goal beyond take turns rolling dice until they are dead.

 * __Secondary Objectives__: Objectives like ""take that wand from the Kobold Shaman"", or ""protect the prisoner from getting recaptured"" are worth adding on occasion.
 
 * Don't go overboard with this, but do keep it in mind.

# Running the Dungeon

## 1. State room descriptions in this order: Dimension & Exits, Monsters, then Details.

 * __Reason__: Dimensions and exits of the room first so the players have a sense of space and the mapper can write it down. Describe sensory details of the monsters seen, preferring to avoid stating its name outright. Then describe key details of the room. Use cardinal directions frequently where appropriate.
 
   * Having a standard order for narration helps hit all the important details of a room consistently.

## 2. When moving, count off feet (or squares) moved in a cardinal direction

 * __Example__: ""You move west down the hallway 5ft, 10ft, 15ft—you are standing in the middle of a T intersection with the halls continuing north or south. What do you do?""

 * __Reason__: This makes life easier for you and the mapper. They will be able to more accurately map, and tracking turns used in movement becomes much simpler.

## 3. Frequently restate the current situation and where the players are located.

 * __Reason__: Restating frequently helps keep players from losing their sense of space and surroundings so everyone can stay on the same page. This is especially important to do when entering new rooms/chambers. E.g. are the players standing at the entrance to the room? Or have they entered and are standing in the middle?

# Miscellaneous Things I Recommend

## 1. Use a caller

 * A caller is the player who is designated to state what all the player characters do in a dungeon turn. Other players can of course correct the caller should they misspeak.

 * __Reason__: Structuring conversation through a caller keeps turns organized much better than resolving things as players state what they want to do directly at you, the GM. This might sound unappealing at first, but it works remarkably well for keeping the game moving. Players talk among themselves, and ask questions to you about what they plan on doing. The turn only gets resolved when the caller is done stating what actions are being taken this turn.

## 2. Roll as little as possible

 * __Reason__: Never roll for things that you expect the PCs to be able to do. Unless there is some significant risk (e.g. hp loss) or reason they might fail, then the players should succeed with most things by default no dice being rolled.

## 3. Roll ^almost everything in the open

 * __Reason__: Doing this has numerous positive effects on the table. For starters, it prevents you from cheating your players as a crutch by showing them the consequences of their actions. Enemies won't pull their punches. As a knock on effect (in my experience at least), players see the dice as an antagonist instead of the GM. Even more, rolling in the open has fostered better cooperation between players and the GM at all the tables I have been at.

 * Secret rolls can be kept secret.

## 4. Utilize Procedures

 * __Reason__: Organization of play is key to keeping a steady and enjoyable pace to the game. It's a lot harder to get derailed with it than without it.",osr,1672213334.0,1,7487,1263

1707,567,1hw6hs5,"Hexcrawls and ""density of content""","Hello guys!
So lately I've decided to get another group to run the game for besides the current group I run.
In the old group I'm running a module called ""Scourge of the Northland"".
For the new group, I'm setting the game in the same world, but in another region. For them I'll be running B2 Keep on the Borderlands.
While trying to make an hexmap for this new group I came across some difficulty with populating hexes.
I spread out some stuff from B2 and added some stuff of my own to the south. So I think that part is decently populated. But I had to make the rest of the hexmap myself (because I wanted it to match SotN's map in size somewhat closely). 
Now I'm faced with some difficulty deciding where to place things.
I have:
- awakened undead crypt
- Dwarven city
- Human and dwarf town
- wizard's tower
- dangerous pass that can be used to enter Northland

But things still feel somewhat empty.
I've tried to make up some rumors to incentivise the players to explore but it still doesn't really feel like it's enough.
Should I just roll for them to get lost and when they wander into another hex I check if I there's a feature there? 
If so should I generate an actual location with things to do or simply ""something interesting"" (like Instead of a village or a camp, just and old runestone or something)? Couldn't that lead to an overtly saturated map?

I want things to feel distant from each other and that making a trip requires preparation. But not so distant as to have everything feel isolated.

Here is the current map for reference.
(Sorry for poor quality).
The northern part is made by me and the southern part is an adaptation of the B2 map.

Kiddos assigned points to the stats they felt were important and selected classes. My son of course went with the Deathbringer class which is akin to a fighter, my youngest daughter selected the Plague Doctor.

Next they rolled up some backgrounds my son getting bounty hunter, and my daughter getting outlaw. Finally rolled for misery. We decided to roll for two of them to really flesh out their history. My son getting banished from home and left for dead. He decided that he knew some dark family secret that warranted him being killed, my daughter got owe someone money, and killed someone important.

""When I suspended Goblinoid Games' social media presence two months ago, it was because I gave myself an ultimatum.

I would write a substantial, totally new product by the first of the year and be well on my way to editing a new edition of Labyrinth Lord. If I didn't succeed in these challenges, I had decided I would close up shop for good. I am near completion of a new solo adventure, currently sitting at around 24,000 words.

In retrospect, maybe I shouldn't have been so hard on myself. I've suffered from moderate to severe anxiety for about the last seven years, amplified by a series of large life changes. The kind of life changes you check the boxes for on a form to determine how much stress you have in your life. At any given time during those years I would probably have three or four big ones happening at once. As a result, all of my hobbies essentially came to a halt. It was hard enough to get by day-to-day, much less write creative content and keep up with the demands of my publishing business. Some of you know I'm a professor, and just performing those duties was challenging enough. And of course Covid.

But I'm happy to say that at this point I'm in a much better place than I've been in years. I've come to terms with many things in my life, and I'm finally in a position to pick up where I left off. I know the industry has changed, and I know many of my supporters have been disappointed with my lack of support for my game lines, Labyrinth Lord especially. I've also let down my publishing partners. But I'm here to tell you today that all of that is coming to an end.
I'm still a one-person, Indy publisher, but in addition to my own efforts I'll be be reaching out to others for partnerships moving forward. I'm very excited for what the future holds, and I hope some of you will join me on this new journey.

To read a little bit more about what I have in mind, please visit my website. It's still under construction but I have some information there about what's next for Labyrinth Lord.

Here's to the future!

1729,642,11bk8gs,The Joy of Using Otter Checks in Dungeons,"Many (all?) of us know the value in the Wandering Monster check. Recently however, I've been seeing value in a check of another sort... the ""Suddenly, Otters!"" Check.

Whenever the party encounters water in the dungeon -- an underground river, a waterfall plunging down into the depths of the Underdark, a tranquil pool in which lissom lamia lasciviously laze -- and linger for more than one turn, I make a ""Suddenly, Otters!"" Check on a `D6`.

1. No otters. 😭
2-5. Suddenly, otters! (`D6+3` otters appear.)
6. A singular otter appears; roll on the _Singular Otters_ table below.

This table will, generally, result in otters appearing more often than not. This is fine because otters are cool and I love them so much. Who doesn't love otters? We need more otters in our D&D.

I find that the party often engages with the otters; rarely, the otters are just there and the party otherwise ignores them; sometimes the party hunts them for food; at other times the party hunts and skins the otters for their pelts. The latter activities all take up precious time, burning through resources such as torches and cranking up those Wandering Monster Checks.

If the ""a singular otter appears"" result is rolled, I make a second `D4` roll on the _Singular Otters_ table.

1. An avatar of Ottar Sathla -- the Primordial Otter Who Roams The Astral Plane -- manifests!
2. A prismatic otter appears, it's fur glistening with rainbow colours. (Such prismatic pelts sell for lashings of gold.)
3. The party has stumbled upon an _Otter Graveyard_, the place to which all otters return to die. What treasures lie beneath the mounds of little otter skeletons... and what evils?
4. Retto the Younger slithers out of the water and asks to join the party; she is a 4th Level Thief, stands as tall as three crucified halflings, and possesses a _Smooth Pebble Of Clam Opening_ which functions as the spell _Knock_ with regard to opening shellfish with one charge weekly.

*allow* something my players say they do, I don’t feel like I’m being too easy on them. It also seems to lend to believability of the situation. Why can’t my character just hide in a closet, why would the skillcheck ever fail? 

This feels very freeing as a GM. And WHEN I say something fails they don’t feel bad and I don’t feel bad because I was able to allow so many other things. They don’t feel cheated and like I’m making stuff up just to thwart them. 

You’re faster than the opponents? You escape, no problem. 

You use your one super overpowered early spell?
Great. It works beautifully, but was it the right spot? Who knows. But it was YOUR decision.  And now you’re out of spells. But my player is so happy that their one spell worked instead of just blasting away the same spell 500 times. Every resource used makes them FEEL powerful because there is restrictions.

Running the game like this is what I feel like my fantasy of what being a GM is. Not just the person that describes the random dice roll outcome.

This wrinkled scrotum sorcerer is smoking ectoplasm. It’s the foundational “atomic” bedrock structure of everything in the Lower Ethereal Hierarchy.

The map here shows a core area of Steelgrave, a city struggling under feudal tyranny some 100 years or so post “event.” (Whatever wrecked the world)

We’ve been running the game using White Box (though probably switching to Wight Box next week) - it has custom classes to fit the post apocalyptic vibe and the three sessions we’ve had so far have been a blast. 

The players are working on their own gang, staking claim on a tiny headquarters and forging alliances and battling other crews, while trying to avoid ORC patrols and helping out the impoverished and largely hopeless peasantry when they can…and delving into the dangerous tunnels and dungeons of the undercity. Steelgrave is placed on the Outdoor Survival map, so hexcrawling will factor in down the line of the players want to go that route. 

This map is largely keyed, but what jumps out when you look at it? What parts would you want to explore or give you ideas? (I promise I won’t use anyone’s ideas without permission if something hits me or is better or more flavorful than what I have now, I promise!!!)

I appreciate it adds realism, it’s not necessarily that hard to track and it’s part of the OSR history / tradition. Maybe that’s reason enough and getting rid of it would lead to a worse experience. Still, have you tried playing without it? Was the game worse? 

Does it actually affect player behaviour? Do your players ever say, “Right, we better stop exploring the dungeon now and head back to town to buy more torch bundles”? Given how cheap and light (pun intended) they are in most systems, isn’t it trivial to keep a very large supply in the first place? 

And what happens if players run out of light? Is it effectively a TPK, with the party stumbling around in pitch darkness, getting picked off by monsters with infravision? Or do the demi-humans just conga line lead everyone out?

It's about clearing up the gaps and the loopholes, the horrendous formatting and outright bad rules.  It's about making something that might have been missed first time around available to everyone.

The past is dead and gone; it's more important to take it's lessons forward than to grieve for it.  When I see a golden idol, I pry the rubies from it's eyes.

Every OSR table uses slightly different rules, hell the same table might use different rules in different games.  The hackability and drive to keep things as light as possible are a core part of the OSR for me, rather than re-simulation of a game even it's authors kept revising.

It seems like a lot of modules basically encourage players being good and heroic do-gooders in a society where adventuring is generally socially accepted the same way going to college is considered a ""good thing"".

However in old school games, the adventurers tend to start out as extremely weak peasants looking for glory, despite just one pit trap away from certain death. Usually those dungeons aren't cleared to save the world, but just because treasures wait inside. So unless the PCs are exceptionally greedy and thrill-seeking or desperate for money, this would be extremely irresponsible behavior with poor RoI in any medieval agricultural society.

I would therefore argue that in Old School games, the PCs start out as ""low-life"" characters and glory seekers, which is in stark contrast to how the PCs are socially perceived in Modern D&D.

5e has its own design philosophy that definitely contradicts many OSR ideas, but here is my question: **Is there anything actually stopping you from running an OSR campaign in 5e?**

What I mean by that is that technically, a design *philosophy* can simply be ignored when setting up a campaign. Many of the principles are not tied to the ruleset, but to the design of the adventure itself.

- 5e is designed with balanced encounters in mind? Ignore that, make everything unbalanced.
- 5e has low lethality due to higher HP? Make everything deal more damage / again, take higher-level enemies.
- 5e usually means simply charging into combat and not engaging with the world intelligently? Well, that's mostly an issue of setting up player expectations correctly.

So I guess it seems to me that *technically* it would not be difficult to implement the OSR philosophy regardless of which ruleset I'm using, even if it is something like 5e.

But are there any core features of OSR that are simply not present in 5e (and really in any non-OSR modern RPGs)? Where bringing back the OSR feeling would require significant homebrewing to the point that using 5e is flat out the wrong choice?

Disclaimer: I dislike 5e for various reasons. Most of all, every class is a spellcaster and everything feels bland because any restrictions have gone out the window along with any world building that goes along with it. You can be a warlock with a celestial patron, stuff like that. But ignoring these things, I do not see how 5e limits OSR play. So I'm interested in your thoughts.",osr,1727160507.0,1,1696,295

How to deal with constant character death?
The problem **ISN'T** that the game is deadly or that characters die. They *like* that.

I'm playing with children (12-15) as part of my job and their characters are *constantly* dying.
Now that's fine, they actually like the challenge and that it's unforgiving.
(It's more demoralising to me, who'd just gotten the wizard inducted into the Mage Guild, he'd picked up a spell book and learned ""sleep"" and then he died stupidly opening a door. All that cool RP and NPCs for nothing)

But story-wise there's supposedly a constant stream of adventurers leaving Hubtown and going to ""check for their buddies in that adventuring party"" and then joining them and replacing the dead guys.
It's lame, but on the other hand, the new players/newly created character needs to be able to join immediately. Sure, they can have to wait ten minutes, but they have to be able to rejoin the group and be part of the game relatively quickly.

Do you guys have any good ideas as to how I can make this happen?
Something something Adventurer's Guild maybe?

Basically I just need old characters to go (in case someone has to leave/is picked up) and a way to get new ones in.

1769,90,1ix9bw8,Rant about learning a complex game system instead of an OSR,"Hi, with my long time group (D&D 2e), we were having a talk about our next game system.

We are playing Stars Without Number (20th game in the campaign and it's great, enough crunch/customization IMO) just after many 10y+ with 5e. It's a good chance and 3/4 of the group love it.. Solo, I played with OSE, Olde Swords Reign and just started Shadowdark. 

My interest in 5e faded away a few years ago. Something was lost in the game and I discovered the OSR indie designers. Got 1 rule book, then many, and bough many adventures. I'm in a happy place.

Yesterday, someone asked to start a new campagin and play 5.5e after SWN.  
  
Since, I don't want to go back to 5.5e, I'm quite vocal. In short, as you probably, the game has too many rules/exceptions + rule lawers, combats are too long, we have uninspiring marvel super heroic abilities for every classes,  and we ended up with a table of power gamers that consulted guides on how to build the most perfect build.... the game becomes unbalance and it's a slog to play.  
  
The DM is listening to all of us and has the final say since he invests time in building the campaign. He wants the group to be happy and he is undecided. I know he enjoyed SWN. A few months ago, I DM a few games of Low Fantasy Gaming and showed them an alternative to 5e. But some players rely to much on the character sheet for abilities and are rule lawyer. They don't like SWN or LFW... and probably they won't like OSR nor Shadodark. This could sound harsh, but their imagination has been brainwased and marvelled by super heroic abilities.

Then, I realized that the DM for 5E has to stop to read/memorize the PHB (5e) and could not track anymore what abilities/feats are doing for everyone, and what is available/upcoming. Something that was never a problem with 1e/2e. Same with the spells, especially the news ones or variants.   
  
Same for my friends: Nobody knows how to play the other characters since they are too complex with all the choices after level 3 or something like that. Maybe one player has a juggernaut memory to remember all the rules, abilities, spells, good for him....

And it bothered me a lot: Why do we play a game where the DM cannot wrap is head around the classes and abilities? Is this a big deal, probably not but I added that to my stack of reasons why we should not bother with 5.5e.  
  
So, I have hard time understanding/convincing my group that 5e. You probably have experience with this since we are in the OSR channel...   
  
Yes, we could split the group since half wants to play SWN/WWN and the other half wants 5.5e. But I'm bothered by the fact that the 5e+ DM/players are not reading the PHB and still wants to play *that* game. I'm angry a little I guess that they could not see that the Without Number game is fun with less crunch and a few combat options... where rules are simple and that we call all enjoy our custom build with unique Talents/Focis and skills...

(argh!)

People have had this discussion for decades, so I won't relitigate anything. In short, I just don't even get why it's (still) a thing. What would you lose if you just used a table that told you how many hit points you had based on your class and level, modified by Constitution? I'm not sure hit points are so dynamic a thing that having them be largely randomized is that desirable. 

That way, you avoid randomness taking away class niches (such as the 1st level Thief rolling higher hit points than the Fighter), 1st level one hitpoint wonders, and people getting screwed by RNG. Plus, I think wildly varying hit points can result in characters doing strange things for entail reasons, such as a high strength 1st level Fighter avoiding melee combat because their hit points are really low.

Obviously, the standard method has been used for decades, so it works. I guess averages do tend to work out; statistical anomalies on the low side will be weeded out most of the time and replaced with characters with better hit point rolls (and if not, subsequent levels should get them to normal). Plus, it can be worked around; a hut point crippled 1st level Fighter could just focus on ranged combat and avoid melee combat.

Overall, though, I'm just not sure hit points benefit from randomness. I think it can unnecessarily cripple characters while adding a weird meta element with little in-game basis. I'm not opposed to randomized advancement (I love Fire Emblem); I just think it's odd to only have hit points advance randomly, and not to hit chance, spell slots, saving throws, etc too.

I'm definitely open to having my mind changed, though. ",osr,1736412897.0,1,1876,328

The mechanics of the game incentivize the players to get the retainers killed in the dungeon so they don't have to pay them a share of the treasure, so the PCs get to keep all the gold and XP for themselves. Now, they haven't been murderous bastards and slit the retainers throats or anything, but I still feel like it creates a narrative problem when the main characters just keep grinding through hired help. How can I get the game to encourage them to keep retainers alive?

The first thing I've tried is making them essentially post a bond on the retainers life of 50 gp per level. They post it with some local authority, and get it back if the retainer comes back alive. If they die, it goes to their next of kin. But as they started to get more and more gold as they leveled up, this became a non-issue. I could adjust the price in future.

Or perhaps the retainers could still earn their share for their families, even if they die. This is a bit harder to justify, since they're not doing any work once dead.

1789,123,1ioyxjm,Something I’ve noticed lately rant…," It seems for all our bragging about “problem solving” people seem to play everything like a video game these days.

Ive been running games for 15 years, and sadly this inadvertent human experiment has shown me most people just dont really think creatively so why brag about it? You might be saying “ Hey change your encounters so they have to be more intriguing” even then, people get frustrated and just fuss, negotiate and scheme to close the gap and bonk (for the combat example). So why this chip on the shoulder that our dungeons are cooler if you have GMs playing boring RAW crap and not awarding creative play? 

Maybe I keep finding sucky players and Im a total tyrant and youre criticizing me in your head, Im ready to believe that. I always think of how Bender used the fire spell to create steam and escape in that one special, thats the kinda play we should praise above all else, not “Uhhhh the dragon saw you anyway that was dumb and did nothing”. It breeds power players and nervous nellys who never want anything more than to stay alive, which translates to - I wanna do max damage with the best thing i have- and any other form of conquering the challenge proves useless or punishable to the character. Players miss clues, nuance and even magic items cause they have this go go go power player attitude even in OSR circles at times.

1797,132,1isutyr,OSR games that still have meaningful chargen?,"I've been delving more into the OSR realm recently since I have found that, as someone who started his rpg journey with dnd 5e, I have been craving something more akin to what I now know to be OSR games. I've been reading quite a few and am loving what I'm reading for the most part, but Im noticing that a part of OSR seems to be very limited character generation.

Now to be clear, I totally get the reasoning behind this. OSR leans very heavily toward being about what you do vs who you are, and I agree with the sentiment that a lot of modern rpgs (that Ive played) sort of frontload the decision making into chargen. Before you even start the first session you know essentially what your character has done, does, and will continue to do. To the point, I really enjoy the IDEA of making character generation the first of many stepping stones rather than an ever-important cornerstone of your journey.

My dilemma is that most of the OSR games Ive been recommended have either randomly generated characters or ""pick a template go from there"" characters, and I don't find that as fun. I don't need it to take an hour to roll a character, hell I don't even need to have a bunch of points and boxes to check, but I do want something that leaves the storytelling to the actual game itself while still making chargen an actual important part of the journey.

For example of two games that I really like: His Majesty the Worm and Trespasser both don't seem to have this problem for me, Trespasser toes the line with its ""semi randomized"" nature but your character choices do feel meaningful later. 

TLDR; Im looking for your favorite OSR games that have character generation that, even if very limited or lacking depth, still ends up mattering or at least allows for customization. I also dont particularly want anything D&D, Id like to branch out.

EDIT: going to pase one of my responses here since it seems I didnt really clarify what meaningful meant to me, 
when I say meaningful I dont mean ""fundamentally changes how I play"" I just mean that I want to make decisions that literally have a meaning mechanically. I can go into nearly any system and make non-mechanical decisions about appearance and backstory and so on (which OSR encourages in spades), but I want something a little bitty step above that. Something to choose or some resource to allocate or a specialty to choose that fundamentally differentiates me from the players beside me, even if it is really niche or not as impactful as what comes later.

I know that usually player customization goes against simplicity and ease of creation. The moment you start adding a lot of different options during character creation you end with D&D 5e.

Nevertheless, I think there can be a way to both have simplicity and character customization. As a player, I like the idea of feats, being able to have very distinct abilities and seeing a nice progression.

I know ShadowDark offers some customization, but is random and is not like you have a lot of things to choose from.

Olde Swords Reign seem more aligned to what I want. But I think there is still room for more player customization.

I guess AD&D has a lot of customization, but people have describite it as a little clunky, with lots os different rules that sometimes don't match very well (sorry, I'm not an expert, surely AD&D has lot of really nice things to offer and I'm sure a lot of you are having tons of fun wiht it).

I also don't enjoy tactical combat that much. I prefer customization more in relation to exploration or narrative. I like feats like being able to breath under water or turning into a goblin. I don't care that much about complex combat manouvers.

I guess what I'm looking for is a system where you have an easy body of rules that are easy to understand but on top of that you have a detailed system of feats, aspects, magic, items, weapons; and its focus is not combat. Something that is easy to grasp but offers a lot of depth.

The assumptions they have are shaped by the rules yes but those assumption have always existed and 5e's popularity from APs made them more prominent.

Personally, I think the main issue is most people in the OSR have with 5e is 30% rules and 70% cultures. You can houserule something easy, but you can't make the majority of players to accept it--Feats are optional, but they're a major draw for players.",osr,1714124530.0,1,934,166

I've just now noticed something that seems problematic, but which I'm sure must have an explanation... the treasure you can find seems to be wildly out of proportion to the levelling process. An example:

The Elder of the village has a dinner service worth 6,000 gp. Let's say a Thief steals that service and manages to fence it for a 20% charge, that nets him 5,000 gp / 5,000 XP which would take him from 1st to 4th level! Even fencing it for 10% of the price would be enough to get him halfway to level 2... If the Thief happens to steal from the Grove, he can net 16,380 gp of gems and get most of the way to level 6 with one big score! Even if I only count coin, there's enough lying around to earn multiple levels.

Even if the party divides the coinage amongst themselves despite the Thief doing all the work, a single dinner set would get most classes to 2nd level.

I'm sure I'm doing something wrong here... can someone help me spot what it is? How do I manage this?

1809,152,1hu7adb,Just realised everyones playing 5E wrong. ,"I was talking to my uncles who like me only play AD&D and other OSR/NSR systems and they said that 5E was much closer to AD&D than 3rd which they hate. They dont play 5E either they stuck with there 2E homebrew, but I was suprised to hear them of all people say this.  They dont play 5E but it was wierd to hear them praise it after the way they talked about 3E.   
  
Maybe the reason 5E lacks so many rules and feels bland is cos its actually designed to be played like AD&D. No rule for it? Just do it and the DM will improvise the sky is the limit. Multiclassing is actually an optional rule so its implied you are not meant to use it. Without mutliclassing all the build culture kinda goes away, yes you get the option between a feat or a +2 to a stat but thats not a big deal, classes kinda do what they say on the tin.  
Also for about the first half of 5E PCs were 90% varient humans cos of the free feat. So it was human centric simular to gygax. Demi humans could be any class but generally had to go towards certain classes cos of how ability scores work. You could do a dwarven mage but he wouldnt be that good cos no int bonus.   


The big issue is 95% of groups play it like its 3.5 which has a rule for everything and will get the books out to argue witht he DM. However 5E apparantly has the same rule that AD&D has ""These rules are just guidelines. The DM can use the ones they like and ignore what they dont like."" as apposed to the 3.5/PF method of ""There is a rule for everything heres how you do it."" 

In a way 5Es a prime example of how gaming culture has just changed over the years. My current group are playing my NSR game, they are however new players, I think they did one 5E oneshot before but dont really have experience with RPGs. My system is based loosly off 2E and people will say stuff like ""Can I roll to do X."" as apposed to saying they are going to do something and then wait for me to respond if they need to roll something or maybe they just find something. 

I wonder if 5E would be a completely different game if it A: Was with the gaming style of ADND and B: Didnt use the optional multiclassing rules, C: Rolling stats was the meta, D: Was human centric ",osr,1736084471.0,1,2199,435

I am currently working on re-imagining the main 4 class types: fighter, thief, mage and cleric. So far I am very happy with my results besides ... the fighter.

I managed to design some pretty reasonable rules for the fighter, but ... how do you make a fighter more interesting? Especially considering his level progression? So far, most fighters I have seen so far consist of simply higher damage values, more attacks, more/better crits etc. So basically just bigger and better numbers. Yes, I am aware of the creative approach of mighty deeds from DCC.

But what makes a fighter a fighter ... outside of fighting? Do you know of any interesting rules for fighters they can utilize outside of combat (perhaps in role play, wilderness, survival etc.). Should a fighter perhapps be the only class (in the later stages of the game) to be allowed of ruling their own stronghold and domain?

Or is it enough, if a figher is just good at ... fighting?

1825,172,1j4s4z5,Suggest me OSR for solo play.,"I play exclusively solo. I have three ""slots"" for my games.

1. I picked Cairn for my NSR experience. My setting is dark fantasy mixed with sword and sorcery (Conan).

2. I selected various PBTA games (Ironsworn, Winsmore) for my story games. Those are low fantasy.

3. I need a game for a pure OSR experience. I want a ""classic"" fantasy setting.


Can this wonderful community help me decide on a system that would fit slot number three?

I usually play with one character and a sidekick plus hirelings. I use a physical notebook for bullet point notes or more detailed fragments. I also use a tablet for PDFs. I don't use minis, though, as I like portability. 

I wonder how it would feel to play something different from NSR or story games, and I am aiming for a ""full party"" OSR experience in solo mode. I considered Scarlet Heroes, Black Tides, and Just One Torch procedures to play with one character, but I've decided to break my rule of having a single main character to get closer to the original OSR experience. I want to play with a full party (3-4 is right number?). 

I don't like very crunchy systems, but OSRs are quite light in general. I like to have at least a pinch more ""game and structure"" than in CAIRN but I don't want to be buried under bookkeeping demands.
I also considered Shadowdark, but I would pass on this occasion, as I want to achieve a more pure OSR experience. For me, Shadowdark is more of an NSR game, because it blends with some 5e concepts, and I am already playing Cairn in NSR slot. 

I'm not sure if I want something closer to 0D&D or B/X. I think it would mainly be about exploration but not only dungeoneering. I guess I would like to explore a bit of the surface as well. Potentially playing a bit of a campaign would allow me to see how character advancement works in OSR (Cairn has Scars mechanics, but I want something more traditional).

As you probably guessed, I did not play original B/X or 0D&D back in the day, so I don't feel nostalgic about it. I am just curious, and I love the concepts in Principia Apocrypha or the OSR Primer.

QUESTIONS:

1. What game would you suggest I play?

2. Do you think playing with an analog notebook would be doable and pleasant (I love my fountain pen!), or would you suggest jumping on some kind of word processing software like OneNote or Obsidian? It is tempting to copy and paste some fragments and have notes in one tool along with my PDFs; also, tracking light, weight, and ammo is simpler than in an analog method.

3. Bonus question: Can you suggest a setting and some supplements, please? Something that enhances solo OSR play, like additional optional procedures, tools, or collections of random tables that would work with the game you suggest.

Thank you!

I get that it's supposed to reward exploration over combat. I get the example of the (very rare) situation where the PCs go into a dungeon, pilfer a bunch of treasure, and escape without spilling a drop of blood.

But there's an easy way to handle that: just give them xp. I love bonus XP. In fact, in my recent games its the only XP I give out. Completing an adventure provides a fixed amount of xp based on a percentage of what is required for advancing a fighter at the party level, modified by the length and difficulty of the adventure.

I’m about to start running my first OSE campaign for a school club, and stoked for it. There are three changes I am planning to make that might mess up the balance and wanted to ask what the unintended effects of these might be. For the record I’m planning to start with some old school 1e modules, and build out to a blend of TSR modules, OSR stuff and homebrew. It will be a Greyhawk campaign set in the Dim Forest area.



Change #1 - Partially replacing GP leveling with objective leveling.

I get the rationale behind GP leveling but I have two concerns about it. First, that instead of incentivizing murder hobo behavior it incentivized kleptomania. I want my players to actually form meaningful alliances with NPC factions, not just get their guard down so they can loot their horde. 

Second, it’s just too much math. The reason I’m leaving 5e is because I want less math, not more. 

5e milestone leveling is an outstanding system that disincentivizes combat, but doesn’t work with a non linear OSR type game. Objective leveling does work.

Let’s say I give a flat amount of points for certain objectives. Overcoming (through any means) a random encounter = 100 points. Overcoming a major hostile NPC = 500 points. Clearing an entire adventure module = 1000 points. Something like that. Points received scale up with level.



Change #2 - Removing demihuman level restrictions, EDIT: adding the human racial bonuses included in the OSE Advanced rule book, but keeping class restrictions.

Again, I have two issues with the level restrictions. First, if you hit the level cap it just feels REALLY bad. Second, if you don’t hit the level cap (a more likely scenario), humans remain the weakest race.

The class restrictions are great, though. They give each race identity. The optional rule says that I can remove level and class but not level or class. Therefore removing level restrictions but not class restrictions is going off script. What effect would that have?

Change #3 - Removing encumbrance 

Somehow this feels like simultaneously the most controversial and least controversial idea mentioned here. Again, the idea is to cut down on math and maximize playtime. My PCs are played by teenagers who won’t do that math anyway and I damn well won’t do it for them. Getting them to track their rations and roleplay solutions will be hard enough. I do note that encumbrance is an optional rule in OSE but I also know removing any tracked resource from a game like this is a recipe for breaking the game.



TL;DR - I want to use an OSR-ized form of milestone leveling, remove level restrictions but NOT class restrictions, and ignore encumbrance. How badly will this break my game?",osr,1735527059.0,1,2990,512
1838,192,1h6k72e,Rerolling ALL HP at every level?,"I have been playing at a table for about a year where the GM lets you reroll ALL of your HP at every level. This was the first I had ever heard of that rule and I was shocked because this is in an OSR-type of game. And then elsewhere in this sub-Reddit today, I saw people talking about that HP rule as a quality-of-life improvement for OSR games and getting a great deal of support for that view. 

I’m just really surprised because it seems really anti-OSR to me. I thought part of the ethos was that you kind of “get what you get” and make the most of it – plan accordingly knowing that your character has relatively few HP, for example. 

I’m just wondering what some of the general thoughts are on this. 

I guess part of it comes down to how resilient one wants the characters to be and a general sense of “fairness,” but it just seems to go against everything I associate with the OSR and the way I played these games growing up. 

I guess I wouldn’t mind a system that said “we want characters to be more resilient, therefore we will have the following rule in play:” but for that rule NOT to be that you reroll all of the HP every level (if you want). Like maybe, after you level, you reroll a 1 or a 1 or 2 for d6+ hit die classes. I would be more okay with that, than letting a player reroll all HP every level. 

I guess this thing triggered me :-)

UPDATE: r/OnslaughtSix told me that the OD&D table he plays at told him that rerolling HP at every level is “a valid reading of the way it’s phrased in OD&D.” After looking at a PDF of OD&D, he’s right. The rules there just state how many “hit dice” a character gets at each level. And if you look at the language there, and the character charts, it actually looks more like one SHOULD be rerolling them at every level by that rule. 

While I have said a lot about letting dice rolls count and I still would prefer not to have a character go up more than a hit die (+ any bonus) of HP from leveling, I also like tradition and don’t mind unusual things that come out of it. So I am much more comfortable now with these types of rules.

I can imagine a few reasons why it wouldn't be common to do this IRL (I believe modern lanterns don't suffer these issues, but medieval lanterns might?):

* Being too close to the body could mess with the air intake, dimming the flame
* The heat generated may be too uncomfortable to stay clipped so close to the body for long
* The contents may slosh around too much, potentially accidentally dousing the flame

If none of the above are enough to outright prevent lanterns from being clipped, I would imagine that there's the possibilities that a fall or solid hit in combat could cause the lantern to shatter and the burning oil to damage the wielder",osr,1741722228.0,1,926,170

1850,211,1imw1ix,Torch Dice - a different system for tracking time,"So, I was preparing a session for next week when I stopped to consider the (often overlooked) importance of tracking resource consumption (like torches).

If exploring a dark and dangerous place carefully and accurately takes time, this “time” should be a resource players decide to spend when they feel it is really important.

For example: checking the whole room thoroughly for traps, secret doors or hidden treasures could be “important” to them and they are therefore willing to spend precious time to do so, risking consuming too much of their resources or causing wandering monsters to arrive.

This concept is clear to me - and I imagine it is shared by many in this subreddit.

However, I have never been a fan of bookkeeping caused by this need and have often fallen into the trap of “ok, come on, I will do a rough evaluation”, which however makes the experience less real and less central during the game session.

I tried to think of an alternative. I'm writing this here to gather criticism and opinions (I have a blog on substack but I almost never use it - maybe I should try writing there too?).

# Torch Dice

At the beginning of the expedition, when the characters buy torches or reorganize their inventory, for each torch carried the GM puts 1d6 in the center of the table.

So, if the players carry a total of 10 torches, he will put 10 dice in the center of the table.

When the characters begin the descent into the dungeon, they must declare who is holding a lit torch: they will be called torchbearers. The torchbearers must take an index card place it in front of them and write 0.

# Consuming Torches

Every time the players decide to perform an action that ""costs time"", the torchbearer rolls a torch die and throws it.

If the **result is higher** than the number written on the index card, the player will write the result as the new number on the index card. The first time, since the value is 0, the player rolls the die and writes the result on the index card.

If instead, the **die roll is lower** than the number on their index card, the torch is consumed and the die is discarded. The torch is removed from the character's inventory, then the player writes 0 again on the index card.

**Example actions:**

* Search for traps
* Search for secret doors
* Rest
* Fight (the torch dice roll is made at the end of the fight)
* Walk very slowly down a hall so as not to make noise

# Party splitted

If the party splits, each group must have a torchbearer, and the dice are divided between the groups (according to the carried torches).

In the worst case, where each character is in a different location, each character is a torchbearer and when they perform an action that costs time, they will roll their own dice.

# Pros

The pros I see are that the torches are not consumed with certainty after X turns, but the players still have some elements to know whether the torch is going out or not. If the value on the index card is high, the torch is close to being exhausted. So, it's a little bit more accurate than the usage die.

Also, physically putting dice on the table and saying ""These are your torches"" I think is a very strong and diegetic action.

# Cons

If the players have many torches, many dice are needed.

If the players are divided into many small groups, the risk is that many dice have to be thrown, too often. And this could get annoying after a while.

1851,212,1j72pjd,How OSR are spell points?,"So, OSR play is very largely about resource management and having spells be just another resource. Vancian magic is a very baked in thing for that, but I feel like enthusiasm for Vancian magic has really waned in the OSR scene. Roll to cast is increasingly used in popular games like DCC and Shadowdark (I believe). I, too, am wondering how necessary or integral Vancian magic is for the OSR experience.

I'm currently interested in the possibilities of a spell point system. What I envision is a pool of spell points that recovers over time, rather than the Vancian way of getting everything back overnight (or rather, by memorizing spells in the morning). You'd probably get a small fixed percentage back per hour. I think the idea is that mages sort of take in ambient energy/magic/whatever and expend it in the form of spells. 

There'd be neat little ways this would work with classes and ability scores, such as a ""Healer"" class casting healing spells for half the spell points but casting offensive spells for double the cost (taken straight from Elder Scrolls: Arena), and high prime requisite spellcasters getting bonus spell points rather than XP progression bonuses.

So, how compatible or incompatible do you think such a system would be with the OSR experience? Classic D&D is all about the ticking clock of resources being expended over the adventuring day, so I could see spell points that gradually recover over time (but not easily refilling) taking away from that. Plus, D&D's lurching progression of skyrocketing in power after getting milestone spells like Fireball would not be a feature of this game. 

I think a benefit of this system would be for spellcasters to not just be out of magic for the entire day. You can always portion it, but if you use it all in a key encounter, you could potentially recover enough for some more minor magic in a few hours. I think there could be interesting resource management aspects to that regarding which spells you cast and when. 

Plus, I think spell creation could be easier and maybe even systemitized if it was point based. 

What do you think? Do you think spell points would add or detract from the OSR experience? Let me know. ",osr,1741506478.0,1,2197,378

I love the lighter nature of a lot of OSR rulesets. Games like Knave in particular that want to get out of your way and let you play instead of having you deal with piles of rules that may never come up.

But I feel that older editions lack for meaningful character customization, especially early on. The only meaningful choice you make in BECMI Basic is what Class you want to play, and even that is largely determined by what you rolled for stats (and may completely determine it if your GM does not allow you to swap your highest roll into your prime requisite). As a Magic User, Elf or Cleric above level 1 you choose spells, but otherwise a fighter is a fighter is a fighter, a dwarf is a dwarf is a dwarf.

The #1 thing I hear mentioned when people talk about switching from D&D 5e to a retroclone is how 'fast' character creation is, but that speed is because you're mostly playing a slot machine and receiving a mostly complete character that  you just need to buy equipment for. Depending on your edition you might choose a separate race or class.

I love Feats as a concept, the idea of a sort of floating group of bonuses or features that you can apply to a character to give them a 'special thing'. To use 5e examples: The ability to stop an enemy moving past you with a polearm, the ability to wear armor your class normally can't wear, or a bit of dabbling in spellcasting.

But the problem with Feats is that they necessarily add complexity. If you add a feat allowing a character to stop an enemy from running past them with a polearm, you are implying that a character without this feat is not allowed to do the same thing. It's a big problem that happened with Pathfinder 1e, where they would add a feat that let you do something, and by adding it, they implied (unintentionally or otherwise) that you could no longer do this thing without that feat.

So, to my question: Do you believe 'Feats' as a concept (Or whatever else they might be called) incompatible with the rulings not rules mentality that makes these games so beloved? Or do you think they can coexist? Or do you know they can coexist because you have an example of some OSR-style game that uses them in a way that is not detrimental to the rules?",osr,1707004134.0,1,2282,425

Most of my TTRPG experience is from D&D 3.5/PF/4e/5e so the OSR mindset feels very alien to me.

I've been struggling to wrap my head around one particular element that most OSR-aligned games seem to view as ideal: Roll 15+ to succeed.

The first time I encountered this was in Knave, where the writer very clearly pointed out that the stat rolling system was designed to funnel you toward stats which would require you to roll \~15 on the dice to succeed, but I'm struggling to understand *why* this is ideal.

Because many OSR books revolve around consequences being severe (save or die traps and spells aplenty, very realistic chance of dying from one attack at level 1, etc), the idea of success hinging on a 25% random chance feels like it would cause such a high volume of character death that by the end of a campaign it would be unlikely for any of the original cast to have survived due to anything but sheer luck.

I'm vaguely aware of the idea of playing the game so that you have to roll dice as little as possible, but I also see a lot of OSR modules that have combat as a high focal point, and there doesn't really seem to be a way to win a fight without dice most of the time.

There are some cleaver twists here and there that I enjoy, like the orc pretending to be a head mounted on a wall, and goblins that regularly hire an ogre to fight for them. But other than that, it looks like a gallery of monsters with few situations to put my players in.

Also, the **monsters are too numerous**. There are rooms with small armies within them.

1. Two PCs are deep into the dungeon, they hear footsteps down the corridor and decide they should hide. Will the patrol notice them? What if the patrol had a dog hound with them? What if there were 3 blind goblins?

2.A PC is climbing up a cliff with good footholds, an arrow out of nowhere hits him in the ribs. Will he be able to hold on or fall?

3. A 3 year old challenges a battle hardened barbarian in an arm wrestling match. Who's going to win?

4. A player in real life works in EMS, his character is a dainty noble princess that has finally escaped from her tower and has never seen anyone but her father and maids. Another PC is on the ground bleeding profusely, his leg was just chopped off. Can the real life EMS player save the PCs life in game?

5. There are two PCs, both Thieves. One PC practices opening locked doors 3 hours a day. The other doesn't. They are now level 10. PC 1 has practised opening locked doors for a total of 3,000 hours, PC 2 has never opened a locked door. They encounter a locked door, are they both as good in opening the locked door, or is PC 1 a lot better due to in game reasons?",osr,1731111823.0,1,1486,286

1868,236,1fhiuq2,How can I handle slaves (as retainers)?,"PLEASE READ THE EDIT BELOW

Foreword: we play *Old School Essentials* and use standard gold coins.

In my setting, slaves are legal and can be purchased.

One of my player asked if they can purchase a slave (or more) and bring them to dungeons. I said: ""Yeah, I mean there is a market for it"" but then I realised that it may be too good. (EDIT: they will be Chaotic if they want to support the slavers.)

The solution I have in mind is that classed slaves have a high upfront cost (maybe 100-200 gold? Or more?) but then you can bring them on adventure and they will fight. There will still be Loyalty Checks (attempt to flee on the first chance on a fail) and they will count towards share of XP like a normal henchman, but they won't get any treasure.

What about weaker slaves that don't fight (like torchbearers)?

Do you think it can work? How would you balance them?

**EDIT**

Reading the replies, a lot of people think this is a troll post or that I am a troll. Sorry if I sounded like that in the post (English is not really my thing).

I mean, I know it can be a though topic to deal with.

I play only with close friends, we are all adults and we discussed this in Session 0: I was ready to drop the theme if any of the players were unconfortable with it. They were okay with it.

We have a lot of media in which slaves are a thing, or a serious matter. *Morrowind,* to name one, which my setting is inspired to. There is a faction which handles the slaves market, and there is a faction that is trying to stop it and remove this inhuman matter from the culture.

One interesting takeaway I got from the replies: if they want to support the slavers, they are going to be Chaotic alignment. They have a Good Cleric in the party, so this should raise some eyebrows.

For the rest, please keep to the topic. I think it can be an interesting matter to discuss, be it be slaves, robots, automations or whatever. (What I mean here is that they don't act as standard retainers because they don't need to be paid for their ""work"". NOT the ethics behind it).

**EDIT 2:** when I wrote ""Yeah, I mean there is a market for it"" I didn't mean that it is a good thing or that I expected it. However, I give players total agency, so if they want to go through this path, sure.

The first step was to understand how it works mechanically (the reason I made this post), then I would have thought of consequences for their decision to support the slave market.",osr,1726423368.0,1,2453,467

The biggest hinderance for me becoming a total OSR bro is the classic OSR mechanics (TSR games and spinoffs). They're just a bit alien to me because I'm accustomed to 5e (not because of any inherent gaping problem with them).

It seems to me that there are some hard-coded things about 5e that are incompatible with OSR play. The skills and CHA system for social interaction, for example, pretty much outright places mechanical performance way over roleplay (and if you invert that as a DM, I think most CHA maximizing players would be affronted). Also, the ""action economy"" results in very videogamey and combo-centric play (""how can I maximize my bonus action"" instead of ""I'll shoot him with my arrow""). And the fact that 5e character power has a much larger basis in your stats than is the case for TSR games.

Other elements, such as low lethality and the overprioritization of ""character building"" seem more malleable to me (remove death saves, feats, multiclassing, etc.)

I'm curious to see if anyone has had success running 5e as an OSR game, and what you had to do to do so.

1894,51,1igs4um,"Do you personally find that online communities increase the pressure to fall in line with the ""community consensus"" on how a given RPG is ""supposed"" to be run and played?","Any given tabletop RPG can be only so comprehensive. There will always be facets of the rules, and practices on how to actually run and play the game, that the books simply do not cover.

Almost invariably, online communities for any given tabletop RPG will gradually devise a loose ""community consensus"" on how the game is ""supposed"" to be run and played. Yes, there will always be disagreements on certain points, but the ""community consensus"" will nevertheless agree on several key topics, even though the books themselves never actually expound on said subjects. This is most visible in subreddits for individual RPGs, where popular opinions get updooted into the hundreds or thousands, while unpopular stances get downvoted and buried; but the phenomenon is also present in a subtler form in Discord servers and in smaller boards.

To me, it feels like the ideal of ""There is no inherently right or wrong way to play a given system"" goes right out the window when someone mentions that they are running and playing the game a certain way, only for other people to come along and say something like ""Yeah, but that is not really how most people play the game"" (i.e. ""You are playing the game wrong""). What matters most, is, ultimately, whether or not the individual group prefers to run and play the game a certain way, but it sure does not feel like it when discussing a game online.

1896,53,1f2mk7r,What RPG from the '90s do you think deserves more love today?,"Back in the 90s, I was deep into ttrpg. I was GM - and sometimes player - for two to three games a week for years. Then life happened and I stepped away for 20 years. Fast forward to covid, and like many others, I got back in ttrpg, rediscovering the hobby as if I’d just stepped out of a cryo-chamber decades in the future.

Against all expectations, playing ttrpgs remotely has been a surprisingly great experience for me. I've been amazed by the massive amount of indie games being published (and I can’t stop buying and reading them, even though I can’t possibly play them all). I’ve also fallen in love with some amazing newer games (newer being a relative term in my situation!).

But after showing some of my old books to my son, I’ve been feeling nostalgic and wanted to revisit some classics. And I’d love to hear your thoughts on games from the 90s that you think still deserve some love today.

I’ll start with some of my favorites (as a GM):

**Rolemaster (1st and 2nd Editions):**  
Yes, this game earned the reputation of being way too complex, often referred to as “Chartmaster” or “Rulesmaster”. And yes, there are charts. So many charts. For instance, there’s one full page chart written in tiny font per weapon! There were also incredibly detailed and fun critical hit and fumble charts (we had fun just browsing through them with my players).

So many parameters and so much creativity were baked into the tables. To avoid browsing the rulebooks during my games I had a display book, a binder full of curated charts for every weapon my players or their enemies had.

Seven “companion” rulebooks were released, packed with additional or alternative rules, more spells, more skills, more classes, more everything. I had them all, and I used maybe 5% of their content but I couldn’t stop browsing them and envisioning how each piece could fit in my campaign. I used this system to run my longest campaign during the whole decade, it still has such a nostalgic power over me.

**Paranoia (1st and 2nd Editions):**  
Paranoia was about chaos, death, and absurdity. And it was brilliant. The game was set in a dystopian underground city where The Computer controlled every aspect of life. The Computer, your “benevolent” overlord, assigned missions, and if you weren't paranoid about your colleagues betraying you to earn favor from The Computer, you were definitely doing something wrong.

One of the things that set Paranoia apart was the fact that your character started the game with six clones. Dying was part of the game. Death could alter the story, reveal secrets, and change the group dynamics. The game encouraged players to come up with the most ridiculous ways for their clones to die. And a lot of fun came from the constant suspicion, double-dealing, and nearly inevitable death.  The humor was dark and biting, and you had to embrace the absurdity to survive (or not!) each mission.

**TORG (1st Edition):**  
I think TORG was one of the most ambitious games of its time. It had this multi-genre, dimension-hopping setting where you could have anything from high fantasy knights battling cyberpunks from the future to pulp heroes fighting off dinosaurs from a lost world.

The game was built around the idea of different realities invading Earth, each one transforming parts of the world into its own unique realm. Each of these ‘Cosms’ had their own rules. For instance, magic could be powerful in one realm but completely useless in another. This dynamic made every game feel fresh and unpredictable.

TORG also included the Drama Deck, a card-based mechanic that added a lot of unpredictability to encounters and created a real cinematic vibe. Players could play cards to boost their actions, create dramatic moments, or turn the tide in unexpected ways. I think a lot of what TORG did was way ahead of its time.

What about you? What is your favorite rpg from the 90s you think deserve a second look today?

EDIT: Fair enough, maybe I should have said the 80s as Rolemaster and Paranoia were released in that decade.

1898,55,yl3b8g,"What *was* your favorite RPG, and why no longer?","Mine was Traveller (Mongoose edition).

I have a few dozen books. I really like the setting, the core rules, the combat.

I didn't like that it starts to break down ""late game"". At one point combat becomes so trivial, rolling dice is more of a dull exercise than an instrument of luck. You can't miss hots. Enemies can't harm you. Targets evaporate on hit. A clever GM can circumvent around this issue, but it requires significant effort and is easy to slip into it.

The game stopped being my favorite since most new books containing equipment and rules, were bad. They were inconsistent with the core rules (exceptions, conflicts, confusion). They were broken (overpowered or useless), or needlessly elaborate. Even the Companion, which otherwise was a good book, had such bad ones. Some additions were so bad, they seemed like they weren't even played out on a piece of paper, not even mentioning playtested.

This got me annoyed over time to the point I preferred playing other games.

Please note. I am not trying to make a political statement. I’m really pointing out that books printed outside the United States may suddenly cost more inside the United States and it would be a good idea to know that. I assume all books currently sitting on the shelf and in warehouses are going to stay the same price, but if a book sells out and a new print run is ordered, there’s a very good chance it may cost a little bit more than it did before. 

Please add to the list.

If you’re looking to buy a rather pricey book, it may be better to get it now than wait 6 months. Also, if publishers try to switch to a US publisher, there may be delays with everyone doing it.

This list is compiled from the books I own. Publishers may use more than one printer. I don’t know that. I can only tell you what I see on the back and the inside covers of the books that I own.

1902,61,18ibj22,Hasbro's Struggle with Monetization and the Struggle for Stable Income in the RPG Industry,"We've been seeing reports coming out from Hasbro of their mass layoffs, but buried in all the financial data is the fact that Wizards of the Coast itself is seeing its revenue go up, but the revenue increases from Magic the Gathering (20%) are larger than the revenue increase from Wizards of the Coast as a whole (3%), suggesting that Dungeons and Dragons is, yet again, in a cycle of losing money.

Large layoffs have already happened and are occurring again.

It's long been a fact of life in the TTRPG industry that it is hard to make money as an independent TTRPG creator, but spoken less often is the fact that it is hard to make money in this industry period. The reason why Dungeons and Dragons belongs to WotC (and by extension, Hasbro) is because of their financial problems in the 1990s, and we seem to be seeing yet another cycle of financial problems today.

One obvious problem is that there is a poor model for recurring income in the industry - you sell your book or core books to people (a player's handbook for playing the game as a player, a gamemaster's guide for running the game as a GM, and maybe a bestiary or something similar to provide monsters to fight) and then... well, what else can you sell? Even amongst those core three, only the player's handbook is needed by most players, meaning that you're already looking at the situation where only maybe 1 in 4 people is buying 2/3rds of your ""Core books"".

Adding additional content is hit and miss, as not everyone is going to be interested in buying additional ""splatbooks"" - sure, a book expanding on magic casters is cool if you like playing casters, but if you are more of a martial leaning character, what are you getting? If you're playing a futuristic sci-fi game, maybe you have a book expanding on spaceships and space battles and whatnot - but how many people in a typical group needs that? One, probably (again, the GM most likely).

Selling adventures? Again, you're selling to GMs.

Selling books about new races? Not everyone feels the need to even have those, and even if they want it, again, you can generally get away with one person in the group buying the book.

And this is ignoring the fact that piracy is a common thing in the TTRPG fanbase, with people downloading books from the Internet rather than actually buying them, further dampening sales.

The result is that, after your initial set of sales, it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain your game, and selling to an ever larger audience is not really a plausible business model - sure, you can expand your audience (D&D has!) but there's a limit on how many people actually want to play these kinds of games.

So what is the solution for having some sort of stable income in this industry?

We've seen WotC try the subscription model in the past - Dungeons and Dragon 4th edition did the whole D&D insider thing where DUngeon and Dragon magazine were rolled in with a bunch of virtual tabletop tools - and it worked well enough (they had hundreds of thousands of subscribers) but it also required an insane amount of content (almost a book's worth of adventures + articles every month) and it also caused 4E to become progressively more bloated and complicated - playing a character out of just the core 4E PHB is way simpler than building a character is now, because there were far fewer options.

And not every game even works like D&D, with many more narrative-focused games not having very complex character creation rules, further stymying the ability to sell content to people.

So what's the solution to this problem? How is it that a company can set itself up to be a stable entity in the RPG ecosystem, without cycles of boom and bust? Is it simply having a small team that you can afford when times are tight, and not expanding it when times are good, so as to avoid having to fire everyone again in three years when sales are back down? Is there some way of getting people to buy into a subscription system that doesn't result in the necessary output stream corroding the game you're working on?",rpg,1702568891.0,0,4066,725

Between *D&D* 4e, *Path*/*Starfinder* 2e, and *D&D* 2024/2025, my favorite to play and run is *D&D* 4e by far, then *Path*/*Starfinder* 2e in distant second, then *D&D* 2024/2025 in an extremely distant last place. Despite this, of the games mentioned above, *D&D* 4e is the one I have been least active with (not too much, though, seeing how I played a session just a few days ago), simply because it is not getting new releases.

Conversely, *Path*/*Starfinder* 2e and *D&D* 2024/2025 are, in fact, getting new releases, which spark my interest and entice me to read through their mechanics: to the point wherein I have stepped up to DM a game of 2024/2025 to give it an earnest try, despite me finding its PC mechanics and its monster designs dishearteningly boring compared to *Path*/*Starfinder* 2e (and especially compared to *D&D* 4e, which I highly value the PC mechanics and monster designs of).

The exploration and social mechanics, touted as 2 of 3 of the main game pillars, are almost non-existent - skill checks with a sliding scale of success are pretty much the limit of what is achieved in core 5e. Heroic-tier notwithstanding, 5e is not even that good at combat - and I say this as somebody who has had fun playing it regularly since 2012. Gritty combat, epic fantasy, unarmed combat - the list goes on -  do not work in core 5e without some major home-brewing and overhauling.

Despite this, every other product I see advertised seems to try and shoehorn itself into D&D 5e to cash in on its popularity. I see ads for Souls-like settings, a Pacific Rim TTRPG, Lovecraftian horror, JRPG school sims, medieval battle games, etc. and so many of them are confining themselves to the 5e system when there are thousands of other systems out there that do what they want to achieve far better. 

To me, if a developer is creating 5e compatible product that isn't some spin on heroic fantasy, then they have either not researched enough TTRPG systems or are cashing in on 5e's success.

Is it a cardinal sin to want your non-heroic fantasy product to be successful? No, of course not. But I am confident that your product will suffer if you stuff it into the framework of a system that doesn't suit it.

1920,87,17op1bc,Are we returning to a less D&D dominant RPG scene?,"Dungeons and Dragons is huge. There’s no denying that. And while the TTRPG industry has experienced a “rising tide lifts all ships” moment, D&D remains, by likely orders of magnitude, the biggest game in the industry. 



But the cracks are showing. Backlash and fatigue against products was shaking even in 2019. Now the the OGL fiasco, the Pinkerton incident, and the confusing “OneD&D rollout” community sentiment has never been more critical of wizards of the coast. Of course, I’m basing this on discourse I see on Reddit and Twitter; places known to be loud echo chambers that rarely represent an actual community. That being said, dungeons and dragons players are likely more online than in other communities, and so the critical voices might represent a larger plurality of places than we think. 



I don’t think D&D is remotely close to dying. There is no “D&D killer” on the horizon. I will also say this subreddit IS an echo chamber- the Ironsworns and FitD and Delta Greens are not the games that will be the ones peeling major numbers off of D&D. But there are games coming that I think will take larger shares of the casual ttrpg fanbase. Pathfinder2e has already exploded in popularity in the last year. 


Major D&D 3rd party content companies Kobold Press and MCDM both of which have a lot of goodwill, are making their own systems. Critical Role, often attributed to be a major part of D&D5es success, with a massive fanbase, are also among those making a fantasy rpg competitor. 



Is it possible we are returning to eras like the mid-late 1990s and early 2010s where D&D is no longer the clear dominant ttrpg? Is this all conjecture? 



I am curious what people think. And please, I don’t wanna see just see tired D&D-bashing, we’ve beaten that horse to a pulp.

So, my partner and I have struggled for years to find a good system to play 1 on 1, after we had done so in 3.5/PF1 as newbies 11 years ago. As I got tired of all the bloat, we experimented and they wanted to bring their beloved characters into something else, so the kitchen sink fantasy (as controversal as it tends to be) is kind of our thing. We tried 5e, PF2e, Shadow of the Weird Wizard, and Cypher System. While their was plenty to like about all of them, there were particular instances of each that my partner didn't enjoy: 
- 5e, vancian casting, wonk challenge ratings, lack of choice

- Pf2e: Holy friggen rules and blocks of text, Batman, and vancian casting

- Cypher System: Depending on what you play, you may feel mechanically flimsy early on and the cypher focus felt off.

- Shadow of the Weird Wizard: Found it overall lack luster

Most recently, I tried designing a Cortex Prime  based set of rules but just couldn't get it right.

A rough description: It sounds like option rich, light to mid crunch with little to track would be the right direction with a narrative focus over simple tactics and nitty gritty of normal ttrpg combat. Systems that avoid proprietary dice preferred that can fit an original setting.

This may sound silly and picky but trying to play in our shared setting is a source of joy and important to us, so suggestions would be very, VERY appreciated. Thanks, and happy holidays, y'all.

UPDATE: You all have given me so much to work with, and I am really grateful! I also apologize to those of you who have undoubtedly been like, ""Get a load of this guy!"" Believe me, I genuinely wish there was a simple fix and have even wondered why the hell I am still trying. I have had a really productive talk with my partner about making some concessions and compromises that we can actually move in a direction with this thing we're passionate about, but can't seem to agree on. I personally have tried way more systems than my partner, and even (I won't say how or where) worked in game design for the better part of a few years, which gives me a bit of perspective that many of you have kindly reminded me of, and I admit some of this has been a fool's errand, no doubt.

Thus, I would like to ask, when have you ever read an rpg that was greatly different from what you were expecting, for better or worse? I'll start.

Worlds Without Number

What I expected: a fairly (and painfully) generic fantasy piece much like In Nomine's Stars without Number's treatment of that respective genre

What I got: Numenera pt. 2-- Iterum Boogaloo

Heroines of the Last Age

What I expected: fun fun happy cyborg cute catgirlz! also a painfully clumsy and low tech scifi """"coat of paint"""" game much like its already generic fantasy og game

What I got: millions/billions of years old scifi civilizations open world space opera complete with space magic also catgirls

Girls by Moonlight

What I expected: So this is Sailor Moon the game I guess?

What I got: epic examination of the magical girl genre across multiple major presentations; ie mecha pilot magical girls, weird cerebral dream conspiracy magical girls, etc.

Tales from the Loop/Things from the Flood

What I expected: 80s kids on bikes mysteries involving figuring out the weird local goings on in the creepy forest involving supernatural occurrences in the Midwest or New England

What I got: gonzo mad pulp science trip, save all time from collapsing as 10 year olds, encounter creatures from other planets, raise an interdimensional space dolphin, fight a T-rex summoned via time-bending electric piano, help abort an android's reality warping psychic baby, etc. also its set in Sweden

Lancer

What I expected: gritty in the trenches mud and lasers mechs action

What I got: pilot a reality-warping space magic mecha to punch ascending cyborg AI gods/magical fascist dictators/higher-universal meta-beings/plain old opportunistic warlords into submission in a galaxy caught between the promise of utopia and those who would tear it down

Termination Shock

What I expected: a gritty Soma/Alien-franchise style """"low/hard sf"""" game

What I got: an optimistic high scifi game, play the """"fledgeling race"""" in a galaxy full of more progressed civilizations up the proverbial tech tree; make your own path out there and/or find a way to fix your screwed-up dystopic home; also a cheeky exercise in """"taking the piss out of"""" certain poorly-conceived """"transhumanist"""" writings

I playtest these RPGs by, essentially, stress-testing them. There is one other person with me. Sometimes, I am the player, and sometimes, I am the GM, but either way, one player controls the entire party. The focus of our playtests is optimization (e.g. picking the best options possible), tactical play with full transparency of statistics on both sides (e.g. the player knows enemy statistics and takes actions accordingly, and the GM likewise knows PC statistics and takes actions accordingly), and generally pushing the game's math to its limit. If the playtest includes clearly broken or overpowered options, I consider it important to playtest and showcase them, because clearly broken or overpowered options are not particularly good for a game's balance. I am under the impression that most other people will test the game ""normally,"" with minimal focus on optimization, so I do something different.

I [frequently get told](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1ftgebr/my_feedback_on_the_13th_age_2e_gamma_playtest/) that it is wrong to playtest in such a way. ""You have a fundamental misunderstanding,"" ""The community strongly disagrees with you,"" ""You are being aggressive and unhelpful,"" ""You are destroying your validity,"" ""You are not supposed to take the broken options,"" and so on and so forth.

1974,148,15mfiaf,Worst official rpg settings?,"So recently I've been flipping through some old rpgs in my possession when I became inspired to write this post.

Which officially published rpg settings do you consider to be the worst, whether because they're boring, because they're weird (and not in a good way), or because they're just unpleasant to run or to play in?

One example I'll give is Degenesis. It has a unique take on post-apocalyptic, but it suffers from a serious problem in actually describing the setting in any clear terms, to the point where the average GM will probably have to read the books 2-3 times to puzzle out the general overview (ironically the clearest view of pre-apocalypse events is given in the format of a 2-3 page long *timeline*... with whole paragraphs printed in annoyingly small font). And even then large swathes of the setting are basically """"and YOU get to figure out these poorly described yet also critically important to the metaplot plot threads!!11!""""

This isn't even touching the whole """"replacement theory"""" and """"the African menace"""" themes that are present throughout the book (the rpg also seems to assume the default pcs are post-apocalyptic white europeans), with sections on how after white colonizers stopped messing with Africa (mainly due to the meteor strike that caused the apocalypse), all Africa somehow united in a massive empire and are now trying to take over the last bastions of white people in Europe through slavery (uh....) and trade networks.

Another dishonorable mention is Dogs in the Vineyard, since I really can't think of a way to describe it other than """"alt!Wild West, but you're religious puritans who *also* happen to be the only legitimate law because instead of magic and crazy weirdness like some *other* alternate Wild West games, this is one where Mormonism took over America"""", which I think would get no buy-in from any group I typically play with.

As someone who was brought into tabletop RPGs through D&D 5e when it was released as a young teenager, my perspective and experience with tabletop RPGs are through a very homogenized neo-trad/modern and narrative-focused lens, tabletop RPGs as a mechanical backbone for collaborative stories and characters.

During NYCC some years ago, I was at a panel about the history of D&D art, and during it, I met one of the nicest old men I've encountered. He used to be one of the players that would play in Gary Gygax's AD&D tournaments and the way he described them was simultaneously amazing and horrifying. The idea of competitive tabletop RPG gaming was intriguing enough as is, but the way he described how he played and the thought process at the table was such a treat, talking about ripping down adamantine doors and scrambling for every last piece of loot before their time was up.

For those who have been in the hobby for a long time, did you notice and/or experience shifting cultures in the hobby? Were you there for the rise (or fall) of any systems, like the big White Wolf boom of the 90s/early 2000s? Have you had any culture shocks when it comes to how the hobby has changed and expectations?

*Author’s Note:* *I use the word “generic” in various forms throughout this review.* *When I say “generic”* *I am referring to so-called Generic Roleplaying games. These are setting neutral games designed to be used for a variety of settings and play experiences. Examples include games like BRP, GURPs, Cypher, and Fate.*

One of the things you need learn if you intend succeed at an Academic™, is that to write a good or interesting paper it is always best to limit your scope. Your chosen topic of expertise is always going to be infinitely complex and granular. Arguments and theories can unravel at the slightest of misunderstandings and ambiguities. So, there is always this temptation to just keep writing more: Go further, and further down the rabbit hole until you’ve reached China or Wonderland, so that way no one can disagree with you or poke holes in your argument.

The more you write, however, the more you realize this is a terrible idea.

Writing a review about *Traveller* presents the same temptations and risks as any academic research might. It has a history almost as long as The Seattle Game, it has countless expansions and versions, and hundreds of fan zines and adventures ready to use. It has mechanics that range from using a sensor array, to teleporting halfway across a galaxy with immense psionic power.

Mongoose Publishing’s [*Traveller 2E (the version discussed in this review)*](https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/products/traveller-core-rulebook-update-2022) has more than 250 pages of rules and stat blocks for running and playing adventures in Charted Space (the game’s default setting). The core book is one of four books that people tend to recommend for people really interested in diving into the game. The other commonly recommended books for those new to *Traveller* are: *High Guard*, *Central Supply Catalogue,* and *Traveller’s Companion.*

Over 1,000 pages of material, items, and rules. And this is just the core + recommended books. You could talk about Mongoose’s entire *Traveller* line of products, including several dozen adventures, box sets, optional expansions, and its semi-regular volumes *Journal of the Traveller’s Aid Society*. Thousands and thousands of pages.

This is the core of the problem with talking about *Traveller* 2E: There is so much material written for the game, and the game’s scope is so ambitious that it flirts with genericism. You could never hope to capture the essence of the whole game and all of the different play experiences in a review, unless you wanted to play and test the game for years to come. And by that point anything you write will be out-of-date, and therefore not be an useful review. So, instead, here is what I will be addressing in this review:

* What is *Traveller* and what is it about?
* Is the *Traveller* Core Rulebook any good? How are the rules?
* How good are the supplements? Do I recommend any of them?
* Do I recommend *Traveller?* Who do I recommend it to?

In this review I won’t be addressing any of the following:

* A review of the complete Mongoose Publishing *Traveller* line. There are simply too review, and I don’t have that kind of cash.
* The nitty-gritty of combat rules (vehicles or people vs people). I don't have space for this, and these aren't the game's selling points anyways.

With this all said, it’s time to fire up the Jump drive and get to the review.

# What is Traveller and What is it About?

Imagine *Firefly* or *Cowboy* *Bebop*. A bunch of losers traverse the galaxy in a spaceship as they take up odd jobs in order off last month’s chicken nugget debt and a ship’s mortgage.

If you’ve ever been mildly interested in trying out *Traveller*, you will probably have encountered this pitch at some point. It’s not wrong, per se, but in my opinion doesn’t really get to the core of what *Traveller* really is. Yes, **Losers in a Spaceship** is a campaign you could run in the game, but *Traveller* isn’t a game designed around being losers in a spaceship.

Jumping back to 1977, when the first of many *Traveller* versions was put out, the game was an intergalactic sandbox intended for players to make money while playing as (mostly) ex-military free traders travelling around an intergalactic sandbox governed by the rules of physics. You still had a mortgage to pay, and the game was very much in the style of the early 1970’s simulationist RPG’s that descended from wargames, such as D&D. 1977’s *Traveller* is probably the version of the game I’d most associate “hard” sci-fi of the bunch, considering it literally requires you to use equations for travel time.

[This is not a joke, here’s a page with square roots.](https://i.imgur.com/vIFLI04.png)

Mongoose Publishing’s *Traveller* 2E is in the same vein, in many respects. It is a simulationist intergalactic sandbox. It has a rule and a stat block for everything. Many aspects of gameplay are coded and categorized in order to get immensely granular with system interactions and player budgeting.

Still there’s many tools for adventure and exploring. In fact, it’s pretty hard to get rich without adventuring, exploring, and making connections. *Traveller* is a game about living in a lived-in world, and the randomness it throws about you. *Traveller* is a game that wants to tell every story in its universe, from a crew of idiots in a Free Trader, to high in the Imperial ranks aboard a heavy battlecruiser, and it wants every role and every decision to matter.

To put it shorter: Mongoose’s *Traveller* 2E is a 1970’s simulationist game about traversing a simulated inter-connected cosmos that has been re-imagined and released for the design priorities of the mid 2010’s. It is much more gamified (gone are the orbital mechanics) while still capturing the procedural and granular ambitions of its 1970’s forebearer. And much like many sandbox games, you don’t have to use every rule (or so the community claims.) This statement is mostly correct, but I’ll be returning to it a little bit later.

# Core Rules and Rulebook

# Rolling Dice and Solving Problems

*Traveller* 2E is a skill-based game that mostly requires rolls of 2D6 + Attribute Modifier + Skill Modifier + Other Modifier(s). This should be familiar to most people who play roleplaying games. However, the core rulebook is also fairly prescriptive of when a certain Attribute modifier should apply to a skill check, and sometimes it isn’t that straightforward. For example, a **Broker** check in order to buy and sell freight goods on a planet actually doesn’t involve an attribute as a bonus, but rather a different series of specific bonuses based off the planet’s attributes.

# Effect and Tasks Chains

A roll might also have an **Effect** modifier applied to it. What is **Effect?** Basically, if you exceed or fail the difficulty of a check you generate **Effect** (up to +3 or down to -3) equal to the difference between success or failure. This mostly comes up in **Task Chains**, which are linked skill checks. Here’s an example of how a task chain ended up in my game:

The crew of the *E. Honda Odyssesy*, Calliope, Lyra, Nyx, and Odysseus have strange cargo aboard that seems to be messing with their ship in jump space. They theorize that, by playing certain frequencies of sound, they can induce whatever is in their cargo to pull them out of jump space and back into normal space.

This starts with a **Science**- **Physics (EDU)** roll from Persephone (target difficulty 8). She rolls a 9, generating an **Effect** of +1.

Odysseus, who has plugged in his bass and amp into the ship’s sensors, rolls an **Art – Instrument (Bass)** **(EDU)** check, rolling a 5 (target difficulty 8). He adds the +1 **Effect** modifier that Persephone generated, bringing his total up to 6. This is still not enough to hit the difficulty, so his roll generates an **Effect** modifier of -2.

Calliope’s **Art – Instrument (Keyboards) (EDU)** roll is much more fortunate, as she rolls a 15 before the -2 **Effect** modifier comes into play, taking her total up to 12. She generates an **Effect** modifier of +3.

Finally at the end of the **Task Chain**, Nyx rolls a **J-Drive (Int)** check, rolling a 7 (target difficulty 12). With her natural + 2 to **J-Drive,** and the **Effect** modifier of +3, Nyx barely succeeds, and the crew causes an intentional “Misjump” to thrust themselves out of Jump space.

**Effect** is also useful outside of task chains, since it can be used to represent degree of success. In my game I oftentimes used **Effect** as a **Hold** (from PBTA games) on research checks, and the active player could use to ask me questions that I had to answer as truthfully as possible (with the caveat that I would not answer anything beyond the scope of the check).

Overall **Effect** and **Task Chains** combined with *Traveller’s* mostly-2d6 resolution system present a fun and engaging core system that is fun while not being over-complicated. Although sometimes I felt like the game got bogged down by some of the required **Task Chains** for things like trading goods (which was also a weird hybrid of 2d6 and 3d6) and preparing a ship to **Jump**. However, the granularity of these checks definitely have a purpose and a place in the game that I will be addressing later.

# Thoughts on Character Creation

If *Traveller* has one killer feature, it’s character creation. You may have heard the rumor that you can die in *Traveller*’s character creation. Although to my knowledge this is not true of the version I played (unless you incorporate an expansion), but it was true of the original 1977 *Traveller*. However, PC death is not the reason to try character creation out. No, you will want to try it out because it is absolutely some of the most fun you will ever have.

This is most fun as a group of friends in Session 0. Have everyone listen and talk to each other while each person takes up the spotlight to roll their own special little buddy up.

# The Process of Creation

Character creation in *Traveller* involves a heavily randomized lifepath system, which launches your PC like a chicken from a cannon through a series of career terms (that you can end at almost any time). While you and your PC may have hopes and dreams for their future, you will quickly find them crushed under the weight of Imperialism and Capitalism.

Take, for example, one poor PC from my game: Ms. Calliope C’thanifix, a Vargr who dreamed of delivering mail for the Scouts and the Imperial mail service. Unfortunately, she rolled up with an **Education (EDU) of 2**, which made qualifying for (and maintaining) any career incredibly difficult. Yet, somehow, she qualified for the **Scout** lifepath. However, when things went well, she suddenly found herself thrown out because her stats were too low to maintain her career. She ended up as a **Drifter**, until eventually she fell into a career as a **Merchant Marine**. With her random assortment of skills, and some dumb luck, she found herself coming out really well. By the time she mustered out at the age of 36, she had a nice career, a healthy paycheck, useful skills, and even a share of a **Free Trader** (the game’s “mascot” spaceship).

This sounds all nice and interesting, but simply relaying this story does not convey how much of an emotional rollercoaster this was. There was one point where things went so poorly for the character that I laughed so hard I cried.

**I’m a GM. I never have fun in character creation!**

And then, when Calliope started to have real success as a **Merchant Marine**, we were all on the edge of out seats. We even egged her on to do one more term so that she might finally make that promotion. Also, for some context, keep in mind that every single term Calliope spent as a **Merchant Marine** came with significant risk of getting kicked out due to her poor stats.

And in that final term, when Calliope finally rolled her promotion, **we cheered, and everyone clapped**. Moments like this don’t happen anywhere else in roleplaying that I’m aware of.

The rules of character creation are great. If I could roll up every character like this, I would.

# A Label for Everything

One thing that Mongoose (and all versions of *Traveller*) did inherit from the 1977 version is the UWP Code. This annoying 8-digit little code is assigned to every single planet in *Traveller*. Each digit reflects a fact about the world that it is assigned to. For example, one of the world’s in my game, Luanina, is run by a dictator named Jane Hernandez. Jane syndicates a nightly soap opera that also serves as a vehicle to inform the public about new laws and policies. Luanina’s UWP code is: D6537BB-6. This means a lot of things, but what is most important to understand is that this provides a general description of the planet. However, just like in real life, players might find that labels are just that: labels. Never judge a book by its cover.

UWP codes are sort of the bane of my existence but are necessary for *Traveller’s* crunchy trade system. I personally find them difficult to read, and I actually wrote an entire blog post on how I would redesign them for my own purposes.

UWP codes reflect *Traveller’s* tendency to provide rules, rulings, and labels such that the entire experience is codified. And, at least with the Mongoose edition I ran, I am fairly certain that this is intentional design. As I said earlier, the game is ambitious to the point that it flirts with generecism. But, intentionally designed to do what, exactly?

# Rules and Complexity

Don’t let my descriptions of the game’s rules and my experience mislead you, *Traveller* is a complicated game. While many games with the label “complicated” or “crunchy” might focus their crunchiness on the abilities and powers of the PC’s, *Traveller*’s complexity is an emergent property of its interconnected game systems. Similar to *D&D*, this game is about resource management, and much of its drama comes from conflicted generated by the demands placed on the PC’s resources. However, *Traveller* differs from a dungeon crawler in that the core resource that is consistently tested and pushed is the player’s finances.

There’s a reason that the most common trope in the game is about a rag-tag crew trying to pay off their ship’s mortgage: *Traveller* is a game holistically designed to generate dramatic tension through incremental taxation on the players economic resources.

This is why every single time players want to go into **Jump** (Method FTL travel) the players are required to do a linked task. This is why combat is fairly deadly without expensive equipment. This is why Brokering and trading for goods while **Jumping** between worlds is a multi-step process. This is why 2 points of damage to a ship’s **Hull** costs 200,000 **Credits** to fix. This is why any **Jump** takes a week. This is why UWP code’s exist.

The game is a slow-burn resource management game that encourages the players to take on extra work in order to defeat the math that is going to, inevitably, weigh them down with the Invisible Hand of the Free Market.

And while this core experience might not sound fun if you look at it through a purely analytical POV, it does really start to shape into something interesting and compelling, if you are the type of group that values the drama that granular randomness provides.

This approach, however, is not without its demerits.

# Why I Loath this Gorram Rulebook

For some additional context, there are two versions of the Mongoose *Traveller* 2E rulebook. There is the 2016 original 2E core book which has this cover, and there is the 2022 updated Core Rulebook. I ran the game out of the 2022 updated Core Rulebook. There were apparently some changes between the two versions (but not enough to call it an edition change). The most notable change was the move from [isometric starship](https://i.imgur.com/mqxsWs4.png) maps to [top-down maps.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj44vmQWFsVm7KscPMobDFEvKZjoDLD1_IpEnYxCU84jrVR7XrmPujbaccLPG-ec8oP2yrmoaRoWjhiP651h75YiGAkXNUYgK9Nmqm3YAHSGlxvZ78KymTyxKdBJw5tiFzvAPKvgju1EJIbhbEXHoX01JLPGlOv7GAqiNS5yucYQaxag9c_i7LVEpDQ/s1350/freetrader.jpg)

While there are good reasons to change from isometric maps to top-down (GM’s will want to run personal combat on their starship at some point and top-down maps are good for that), I actually prefer the isometric maps as a means to help me and the players grok the starship’s layout. Whelp, you win some, you lose some. Anyways, back to the topic on hand.

The more complex and granular your rules, and the closer your game swings towards simulationist generecism; the more difficult it becomes to write a rulebook that accounts for all settings, all scenarios, and all styles of play. If you consider that all of this content needs to fit in a certain page count for physical production, this problem becomes even more complicated.

Writing a rulebook ain’t easy. But still, few rulebooks\* (\*for games published by mainstream RPG publishers) have ever made me as frustrated as *Traveller* when adjudicating and learning the rules. The location of common rules was often unintuitive (and not listed in the Index) and took up significant time during play. Reading through the book just felt like I was reading someone’s sticky notes left on their computer monitor: One moment, you’re reading about the rules for low gravity, and then fatigue, and then you’re reading about the rules for Medical Treatment and Surgery. Then, BAM, another sticky note reminding you that Humans and Animals have completely different rules for health and how random encounters work.  

As an aside: I think that rule (animal vs human health) is stupid. They should all just use health. The only reason human health is calculated in the same way as players is to reinforce a sense of realism. I dislike doing it this way because it doesn’t really tie into the core **Money-as-resource** gameplay loop, and instead just adds pointless admin from the GM to track.

Rules were often spread throughout the rulebook unintuitively, but none were egregious as the placement of the introductions to **Tech Level** and **Starport Quality**. This will require a brief explanation of the information that exists in UWP codes:

UWP Codes provide the following information, in order, with each digit of the code representing information about the planet that can be found on a corresponding chart:

\[Starport Quality\] \[Planet Size\] \[Planet Atmosphere\] \[Planet Hydrographic Index\] \[Population Level\] \[Government Type\] \[Law Level\]-\[Tech Level\]

So, naturally, **Tech Level** I (the last item in the UWP code) is only introduced and explained on page 6, and **Starport Quality** is introduced on explained on page 257 after the explanations of Planet Size, Hydrographic Index, Population level, Government Type, and Law Level.

While this might seem nitpicky, UWP codes are one of the most important features of the **Money-as-resource** gameplay loop *Traveller’s* granular rules are designed around. Every planet has a UWP code. Players plan complicated trading routes based on the information UWP codes provide. DM’s make informed setting decisions based on UWP codes.

Why aren’t UWP codes explained earlier, instead of in a sidebar on page 248 when they are so vital to the intended gameplay loop? Why is the information that each digit in a UWP code presented in such an unintuitive order, rather than following the order of the code?

*Traveller* veterans probably won’t see the problem here, but for my group that was learning the game as we played, the work and rulebook-flipping required to understand UWP codes was frustrating and took up valuable time. Even after we learned the basics, the granularity of the charts in each section required us all to flip through the book to find the information we needed, since we could not reasonably expect to memorize every chart.

It felt like every process and every rule necessitated constant flipping, and the poor organization really slowed us down considerably, and our game was lesser for it.

This wasn’t a group of an RPG-newbie problem or a table either. I have run 12+ different games of varying complexity. One of my players is a professional boardgame and TTRPG designer. The rest of my group are veterans who have played dozens of games between each other. My group has played several games together at this point, and we know how to work efficiently to figure out rules and rules interactions.

The rulebook’s organizational decisions just served to slow us down, much in the way I complained about regarding [*Star Trek Adventures first edition.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1bizbk5/a_brief_review_of_the_modiphius_star_trek_rpg/)

Do I know how to fix this problem? Slightly. Is it fixable? Definitely. Was it expected due to the game’s complexity? Yes. It’s still very frustrating.

# Spaceballs, the RPG Supplements

Mongoose Publishing has, I think, published more than a hundred different supplements and products related to *Traveller* 2E.  Most of these are sourcebooks or adventures. And because I’m not a Youtuebe reviewer I don’t get a massive influx of products for free, so reviewing everything Mongoose releases is out of the question. I paid for everything *Traveller*-related I have with cold, hard, cash.

I own the following *Traveller* products. If there’s a smiley-face next to it, it means I recommend it to people who are interested in checking out *Traveller*, and that it is worth your money. A frowny-face means I did not like the product, and don’t recommend it.

Generally speaking, I don’t like a lot of the *Traveller* products I’ve encountered so far. Many of them, especially those from earlier in *Traveller* 2E’s life, suffer from misguided organization (I could write an entire novel about this, I won’t), and frankly are not the most useful or interesting. I found the art in most of those uninspiring, and the focus on *Traveller’s* granular rules a little bit frustrating.  All of the wrong details, in all of the wrong places in half-baked products.


*Author’s Hot Take:* *If an adventure opens with a UWP, then that adventure is prioritizing the wrong things.*

As far as the adventures go, Mongoose’s *Traveller* adventures are really hit-or-miss. I really, really hated *The Last Train out of Rakken-Goll*, but the product itself is reflective of my larger issues with the standalone adventures: they often provide the wrong types of information and guidance to a GM that wants to run the game. For example, I felt *Mission to Mithril* lacked a compelling structure that aided the DM (it’s a bizarrely under-monstered and railroady hexcrawl), nor the level of art I’d want in order to justify its $20 price tag. However, *Mysteries on Arcturus* *Station* was absolutely superb, and was everything I had ever wanted in an adventure (bonus points for extreme replay-ability).

I disliked *Islands in the Rift* because, similar to *Rakken-Goll* and *Mithril* I felt like it didn’t provide enough content or guidance to really justify its price tag. Seth Skorkowsky loved *Islands in the Rift*, but I’d imagine that’s influenced by his experience running an absolutely epic campaign based off of it. However, for me, it just didn’t have everything I would want from an at the price it’s sold at. I’d rather pick of [*Winter’s Daughter*](https://necroticgnome.com/products/dolmenwood-winters-daughter), [*Lurkers*](https://modiphius.net/en-us/products/star-trek-adventures-mission-pdf-023-lurkers)*,* or [*Shadowdark Zines*](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/collections/cursed-scroll-zine) simply because I know that there is going to be a minimum level of quality and usefulness that I know these products will meet.

As for the catalogue-style books (*Highguard, Central Supply, etc.*) I would really only recommend those to the types of DM’s who love running Generic RPGs such as GURPS. They are page after page of items, and item stats. These never really came in handy for my game, and I personally regret my purchase of them. I don’t particularly enjoy flipping with item sourcebooks, so I didn’t really get any personal enjoyment out of these either. I am a little surprised that these are recommended so often for newbies over *Journal of the Traveller’s Aid Society* (JTAS). These books are a serious financial investment for a product that really only serves a certain style of play.

Catalogues and adventures addressed: where *Traveller* products really do seem to excel are what I call mixed-content books like *Aliens of Charted Space* and the various Volumes of the *Journal of the Traveller’s Aid Society* (JTAS). The sheer volume of content in these basically assures you will find something interesting and usable in your game. *Traveller* content is at its best when it is providing something novel for your game that helps to convey the game’s Charted Space setting. *Aliens of Charted Space* was a joy to read (especially to learn about my guys, the Bwap). The volumes of *JTAS* and *Aliens of Charted Space* both provided me with some very cool ships, a useful decent-quality adventure (or two), and some fun setting details. As far as I am concerned *JTAS* volumes are probably the best bang for buck.

Although I cannot afford to read all of them, t is very likely that all of the Volumes in these two series are worth your money. If they look interesting enough to, and I actually recommend to newbie GM’s that they pick up the two volumes of these that I have in my collection, instead of *High Guard* and the other catalogue books that are usually recommended. These books will serve as a sampler for you to use as you develop a better sense of the types of resources that are useful for you and your playgroup, rather than shelling out $120+ on the typical recommended sourcebooks.

Lastly, the *Referee’s* *Screen* is excellent, and I can only imagine that the newest version is just as good.

Despite liking *Aliens* *of Charted Space* and *JTAS* (and the consistent improvements to adventures and sourcebooks over the lifecycle of *Traveller* 2E), I still find myself to be a very hesitant buyer of *Traveller* supplements. I’ve been burned by one-too-many *The Last Train out of Rakken-Golls* to really endorse the game’s product line, despite the occasional temptation. For example[, *Last call at Eneri’s Cantina*](https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/products/core-adventure-2-last-call-at-eneris-cantina?_pos=1&_sid=9567327be&_ss=r) looks compelling, and the preview art and layout **looks** like an improvement. But is it actually a good adventure? I don’t know. And I don’t have the confidence to buy the adventure to find out. And because there’s not really a robust review community for *Traveller* products in the same way there is for *D&D*, it’s pretty easy to get burnt on a bad product purchase. In short: I really don’t like the Russian roulette I have to play when it comes to Mongoose’s products.

Mongoose, if you are reading, I would actually really love to write an in-depth review of [*Bounty Hunter*](https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/products/bounty-hunter). It looks exactly like the type of product I would value for my *Traveller* game, and the preview pages look promising. As it stands, I just can’t make a purchase with any confidence.

In short: be careful about purchasing supplements for *Traveller* as a newbie. The various volumes of *JTAS* and *Aliens of Charted Space* are probably your safest purchases if you are looking to get your feet wet with more material without breaking the bank or running into disappointment.

# Do I Like Traveller? Do I Recommend It?

My players and I have enjoyed our time with *Traveller*, despite some of our mutual frustrations with the game. Although, I doubt my current group will be returning to it any time soon. This is partially because we are pretty donezo with the core rulebook, and because ultimately it doesn’t actually fit the constraints and style of playgroup. My *Traveller* group meets for 3-4 hours, once every two weeks, online, on a weekday, which was to our detriment when it comes to this game. We’re very roleplay heavy, so this means we have a lot of time between rolls and interacting with the core mechancis.

*Traveller* is the type of game where you want the players to engage with all of the mechanics and processes in order to ramp up the tension between time and monetary resources. Unfortunately, the processes (especially trading) take time. You can automate these things with a spreadsheet (like we did), but at the end of the day the admin work we were doing was really running into the story and the characters in an unpleasant way. This led us to have an unbalanced experience: sometimes a session might be dominated by trade rolls and admin, and the other times it might be dominated by another process or procedure.

However, I don’t think this is going to be an issue for groups who meet in-person and for longer sessions. Crosstalk, which really only happens in-person, seems like it would address the group-boredom that seemed to occur when my ship’s **Broker** was dealing with trade rolls. And the longer session times should lead to a more balanced experience with the game.

If my sessions were 5-6 hours long, I probably would not have been frustrated by the uneven and inconsistent gaming experience my sessions seemed to produce. I probably would have been able to explore all of the mechanics with the depth they deserve. However, my constraints are my constraints, and I learned a lot from this experience.

Do I like *Traveller?* Yes. I will probably run it again.

Do I recommend *Traveller*? This is a harder question to answer, I definitely cannot recommend it to everyone. Instead, I want to provide advice on those whose interest is already piqued (or has been piqued by this review):

If you are interested in *Traveller*, buy the core rulebook and *JTAS Vol.1*. Run some adventures that take place in the same system as the planet Hazel (from the adventure *Ship in the Lake* in JTAS Vo.1).  Make sure you give yourself at least 4 hours per session, although 5+ will be better. Try to run it in-person. Make sure everyone at your table is willing to learn the rules to help you run the game.

Run 8-10 sessions.

You’ll know.

**But what if I don’t want to run eight sessions?**

The people I can recommend *Traveller* for, then, are those people who really enjoy the granularity and modularity of something like *Gurps*, *Cyberpunk: Red*, or various crunchy Generic or borderline-Generic games. I can also recommend it to people who love accumulating things. Traveller has tons of *stuff*. In many ways the game is about *stuff.* If you like games with lots of catalogues of weapons and items, then *Traveller* might be worth a shot.

However, if you’re looking to tell a space opera, or something like *Cowboy Bebop*, and you run shorter sessions, then I think there are games out there that will better suit your needs.

Want to run *D&D* but in space? Look at [*Starfinder*](https://paizo.com/starfinder) first. Hint: you might want to wait till *Starfinder 2* releases.

Want to run something episodic problem-of-the-week? Look, here’s [*Star Trek Adventures.*](https://modiphius.net/en-us/collections/star-trek-adventures/products/star-trek-adventures-the-roleplaying-game-second-edition-core-rulebook)

Want to run *Cowboy Bebop* or *Star Wars*? Look at [*Scum and Villainy*](https://evilhat.com/product/scum-and-villainy/) or [*Edge of the Empire*](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-edge-of-the-empire/) first.

However, if you want to run a sci-fi game with a storied history, and the ambition to match the sheer depth of its setting and granularity, and don’t mind a few paint marks? Try *Traveller*.

Want to tell the story of a small group of space idiots just trying to make it in a world that is too big to care about them? That sounds like *Traveller* to me.

In my opinion, the game is best when it is about stories so small that you could sink into its infinite setting forever and be happy. *Traveller* is a game and a setting that rewards lifetime players. I’ve seen where this game can go, and the beautiful moments it can produce.

Ultimately, between the frustrating, it's insane scope, the time-consuming process-driven core gameplay loop, hit-or-miss publisher support,  and its hyper-expansive setting, it’s just too much for me. But there are definitely people out there it is for.

# Some Resources I Found Useful

[On the Four Table Legs of Traveller, by Sir Poley](https://sirpoley.tumblr.com/post/623913566725193728/on-the-four-table-legs-of-traveller-leg) – A nice blog post by someone who understands *Traveller* far better than I ever will.

[Seth Skorkowsky’s *Traveller* Overview](https://youtu.be/QdCq91MP9wE?si=OOAyNb5sT0k0NZ1U) – A really good overview and thorough review of *Traveller’s* rules. Slightly out-of-date with the 2022 revisions to the core book, but basically 1-to-1. I probably am single-handedly accountable for half the views in this series.

[Seth Skorkowsky’s review of *Murder on Arcturus Station*](https://youtu.be/HZ6M8pGa138?si=siJmc4KiCeM1wvvj) – Seth is like a jedi of the investigative RPG genre. A master tells you how to run a masterpiece.

[Income, Costs, Passengers, and Trade Calculator Spreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/traveller/comments/1caq225/income_costs_passengers_and_trade_calculator/) – This Excel sheet made running trade a lot faster and let us track everything in a convenient place. This was made by one of my players. I probably would have burned out without this.

[Cepheus Journal – Sector Generator](https://cepheusjournal.com/generators/random-subsector-generator/) – I made my own sector with this for my game, and it was a blast.

1996,172,1ej2chg,Grumble/Gripe: No more Firefly/Serenity RPG support.,"Old news for most, I guess.  Margaret Weis Productions stopped its efforts to develop its Firefly TTRPG back around 2015.  No detailed explanation given.

I found out only because I ""inherited"" all the books from someone who had decided to focus on the D&D franchise instead.  A cursory search turned up no new material (other than fan-made items).  I'll do a more intensive search next week.

It seems that popular TV/Movie franchises inspired some decent TTRPG products -- Stargate (Alderac & Wyvern), Star Trek (FASA), and Star Wars (WEG), to name a few -- that have suddenly stopped production.  There is still Traveller, but that's not based on any one franchise.

I have always been more interested in Science-Fiction than Fantasy.  TV and motion pictures have filled that need for a few decades.  TTRPGs also contributed.  Now, all that seems to be left are a few ""orphaned"" products and a lot of B-Grade fanworks.

Bummer.

**\[edit=18\_hours\_later\]**

Lessons Learned

1. RPGs based on specific media franchises are inherently short-lived.  Licenses can be pulled at any time, or simply not renewed.
2. For a creative mind, only the core books of any game are needed.
3. RPGs offering generic rules systems as their primary selling points are a more commercially viable choice, as even the most obscure media franchise can be squeezed into them.
4. No matter how clearly a situation is explained, there will always be someone who misunderstands its content, context, or intent.

I got my start with D&D like almost everyone, but the first system I actually tried playing after that was Werewolf: The Forsaken. I read an AP of the game on another forum and thought that it looked interesting, so I got the book (and the core World of Darkness book once I found out I needed that; this was the first edition) and I was hooked pretty much right away. Got a friend together to try running a single-player story, and got through a few sessions before moving on to another system.

However, I’m sure most of you can agree that D&D 5e is a very flawed system, and I’ve definitely noticed many issues throughout my play. Primarily, I dislike the lack of non-combat and RP abilities given to players and how much of the available content (for players and GMs) feels very uninspired/generic. 

As such, I’m in the market for a new system that is similar to 5e in complexity, but makes up for its flaws. I’d love any good recommendations, and if you could provide a short overview or description that’d be great!",rpg,1720477201.0,0,798,144

UPDATE RESPONSE:  


Thank you everyone for the recommendations! I've just finished reviewing every one of your suggestions and am still weighing my options. The theme that I offered to the rabbis as a driving narrative purpose behind the game is ""empathy of the other"". For that reason, I'm leaning towards Thorny Game's *Sign*.

- Shadowdark (plus some small adventures), which is great for one shots and open tables as it's full of simple, flavorful and well designed sub-systems, and interesting tables.
- Dolmenwood, which I only just started reading, but it's an absolutely gorgeous, deep setting and is pretty much perfect for the group I run a campaign for.

I think I love this kind of product, it feels very complete and makes me very excited to run it.

1. The company is very active on social media. Employees of the company appear on podcasts and YouTube channels all the time.
2. The company releases a free DLC PDF every month with new rules, new cyberware, new weapons, new NPCs. I think this is a huge win for keeping people engaged in the game. I look forward to that free DLC every month. And for the people like me that want that physical product, they roll a bunch of DLCs into a softcover book with one new article and sell it as a PDF or a POD book.
3. They released a set of pins through Pinny Arcade. The pins came with 4 new pieces of cyberware on a card. When they found out the pins were not available outside the US, they released a PDF of just the cyberware for $0.99.
4. They sold out of their GM screen. They're still looking for a printer to make new screens. It's been a WHILE since the screens were available. So, they discounted the GM PDF screen to $1.00 until the physical screens are back in stock as a ""Sorry this is taking so long"" gift.
5. They run a Discord server and the people that wrote the game are on it all the time answering questions. Heck, one of the game designers recently did a chat Q&A because his plane got delayed at the airport and he had some time to kill.
6. They go to Pax Unplugged and Gen-Con.

Conventionally, when you write rules for an RPG, you put them into a PDF. With my most recent project, instead of designing the rules to be put in a PDF, I focused on building a wiki.

The advantage of a wiki is that it is very easy to navigate, and if hosted on a website, very easy to share. I used [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) to [make my most recent game](https://ttadventuretime.github.io), which has additional virtues:

1. It uses an index-card system, where you can have multiple pages (""cards"") open at once, and link someone to all of the cards you had open. You can also bookmark and un-bookmark cards. You can have cards composed of other cards, so you can link people to just one particular rule you want to refer to. It just has all sorts of excellent navigation features.
2. You can download the whole wiki as an HTML page for offline viewing, and it isn't a large file.
3. It looks great. I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but honestly think it is easier to design a good looking wiki with this than a good looking PDF.

Most of it is totally standard and normal, but there's a bit that stuck out like a sore thumb to me.

There's a section of the GM's Guide pamphlet that talks about what to do if the party loses in combat, and it has this to say:

> **Handling Party Defeat**
>
>An adventurer’s life is full of danger. One unlucky turn too many, and they can easily find themself Knocked Out. If all party members are reduced to 0 HP, the party is defeated. Some scenarios include directions for dealing with this situation, but if yours does not, talk with the other players and decide how your group wants to handle it.
>
> Typically, you’ll want to choose from among the following
options, but your group is welcome to come up with exciting
or amusing alternatives instead.
>
> **1. Retry the Encounter**
>Retrying from the beginning of an encounter will let players anticipate the actions their enemies may take, resulting in a better chance of victory. When a party wipes during a boss battle or similarly challenging encounter, you can also lower the difficulty by restoring the adventurers’ HP and MP and allowing them to
retry from the beginning of the phase. Retrying an encounter can be time-consuming. If you’re nearing the end of your session, it may be best to quicksave and try again the next time you play.
>
> **2. Restart the Scenario**
> Scenarios are often shaped by the adventurers’ actions, and encounters and endings may change depending on the choices that they make. As such, your group can choose to take a party wipe as an opportunity to begin the scenario
anew. It goes without saying that this will take even longer than retrying a single encounter, so you may want to wait until your next session before starting over. When starting a new scenario, players can either prepare new adventurer sheets of the appropriate level, or level up their existing adventurers to match the scenario’s level.
>
> If a player chooses to continue playing as the same adventurer, have them write down the name of any scenarios they’ve completed in their profile so they can keep track of their character’s exploits and experiences.
>
> **3. Improvise**
Improvising solutions on the fly might seem like a daunting task, but you can always plan for situations like this in advance. For example, here’s a good trick to keep up your sleeve:
>
>>GM: Just when things are looking grim for the party, help arrives in the nick of time and revives the fallen adventurers! 
>
> Look at that! An ally swoops in to save the day, and the adventurers recover just enough to continue the fight. It’s up to you how much HP the adventurers regain, but you can always default to half of their Max HP, rounded up.
>
> When using this option, you may want to come up with narrative reasons to make it more compelling for the other players. Perhaps an NPC the party helped earlier in the story appeared to repay a previous kindness, or an enemy decided to show mercy (or contempt) and let the party live.
>
> You’ll also need to think of a reason for their newfound health. White magic, Potions, or even time bought through a well-placed distraction could explain how the adventurers survived a seemingly lethal encounter.
>
> **4. Skip the Encounter**
> If you’re running short on time, you can always choose to advance the story as if the adventurers had won the encounter.
>
> Take care not to overuse this option, as skipping encounters can defeat the purpose of the game. There’s
nothing wrong with dialogue-focused stories if players are looking to roleplay, but encounters in the Final Fantasy XIV TTRPG also make up a key part of the narrative. Leaving the outcome of player choices to chance can take the story in unexpected and exciting directions, and can even create fresh opportunities for roleplay.

All of this advice seems totally insane and borderline heretical to me. Like, can you imagine if in the new D&D edition, the Player's handbook said, *""if you have a TPK, don't worry! Just restart the fight from the beginning so that your players can metagame to victory!""* or *""if you have a TPK, don't worry! You can just, like, pretend that they didn't and keep playing as if they had won!""* People would lose their minds!

But I have to wonder if that's just because I was raised in American gaming culture. Since this is a game written by a Japanese person for a Japanese audience (it credits Yoshiyuki Fushimi as the only designer, from Hobby Japan), it occurred to me that this might be just a cultural difference and that a Japanese RPG player would find this advice completely normal and standard.

It has an emphasis on ranged combat options. I have noticed that, intentionally or otherwise, combatants are disinclined towards aggressive engagements and instead find a better risk:reward ratio in turtling, kiting, and other defensive tactics. (Grenades and missiles really are not that good in this game, too, in my opinion.) Maybe this is true to real life, but I find that it makes for a boring tactical experience.

I am aware that sci-fi wargames, and at least one grid-based tactical sci-fi RPG with lots of ranged combat, solve this through objective/capture points. These are usually zones on the map that units have to stay inside in order to ""capture"" them or something similar (e.g. hack the terminals). Alternatives include an object that needs to be pushed around the map by staying next to it (e.g. escort the truck), and points that need to be defended from enemy attacks (e.g. protect the towers). Often, these zones are out in the open, making them difficult to turtle in. Objective/capture points also make AoE stronger, for good or for ill.

Honestly, I rarely use pre-made worlds in general unless A. it's one I'm already intimately familiar with, or B. I'm running a module. The reason is quite simple, I know for certain that if I ran a campaign in the Forgotten Realms or Golarion, I'm going to get a lot of info wrong.

If I'm playing in a pre-made world and someone asks me where Dragonborns primarily live, I'd have no earthly idea, and whatever answer I give would be complete bullshit. Meanwhile, in a world of my own creation, I am the god of the world, what I say is gospel. If I say ""oh, Dragonborn can be found all over the country but they particularly gather around the east coast"", it doesn't matter if what I said was complete bullshit or not, it's now canon lore. There's no official book for someone to use to come in and ""um actually"" me, I AM the book.

Similarly, if I were to run a campaign set in Amestris or Fodlan, I could pretty decently answer any question they have. If someone asked me about the Ishvalans, I could do a moderately good job explaining their deal, their religion, their relationship with the Amestrians, etc. I might get some details wrong, but the overall explanation would be at least 70% accurate. If you were to ask me to explain Forgotten Realms elves, what's said in the PHB is all I could realistically be accurate about, the rest would either be completely wrong or accurate by accident.

I could probably just be confidently incorrect anyways and if anyone speaks up about it go ""Well, now it's this way now, I'm the DM"", but I do not have the balls to do that.

He asked me for help because he would like to find a system for the adventure he has in mind because dnd 5e, which is what we currently use,  doesn't seem to fit. 

Basically it will be the story of a group of adventurers who discover that they are fallen gods and slowly regain their lost strength and power. 

He would like a system that allows a lot of flexibility and freedom in character creation so that we can use any deity we can think of. 

We had tried dungeon world in the past, but he doesn't like the system because it is too light in the fighting part, where he would like more crunch instead. 

I have heard of city of mist. I don't know it at all, but from what I've read around, although the theme is similar, I don't think it's suitable for telling this kind of story, since it should focus more on the conflict between human and mythos. I also don't know how far it deviates from dungeon world as mechanics. 
If any of you are familiar with it please tell me if I am wrong and if it would fit. 

To conclude so what he's looking for is something that leaves a lot of freedom or allows a lot of customization in the character creation phase and his abilities, but has a few more rules regarding combat and exploration.

I have also run and played my fair share of indie darlings; while some were good, others did not live up to the hype for me.

What has been your experience with the really, really obscure games, the ones that are all but unknown even by indie standards?

___

It is not **that** obscure (mostly because it is attached to a relatively more well-known system, and I do mean relatively), but one game I have gotten quite invested in as of late is [*Tailfeathers*/*Kazzam*](https://jimbozig.itch.io/tailfeathers). It is a grid-based tactical combat game set in a wizard school.

On the far more obscure end, I once saw an extremely ambitious D&D 4e heartbreaker called simply ""4.5"" (which is, admittedly, un-Google-able). It was hundreds upon hundreds of pages long, and had a wide variety of classes [and powers](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/351756476231974913/1202571577774833695/Encounter_Powers.png). The author had a fully automated framework for it in MapTool. I played through several encounters as a blaster caster. The game was surprisingly enjoyable and reasonably well-balanced, though the author admitted that blaster casters were overpowered in the current version. The monster abilities actually forced a good deal of variety in player tactics.

Sadly, the author lost all confidence and shelved the project, never to be seen again. It was unfortunate, especially since the game was already in a fully playable state. I still have the PDF of the rules, but I do not know if the author would want it to be disseminated, particularly when there were several updates and balance patches planned.",rpg,1706775213.0,0,2591,418

What would you consider an RPG worth learning about even if you never intend to play it? Particularly those that you wouldn't recommend in general.

For me I think having an understanding of D&D is useful for communicating with the many RPG players who are most familiar with it or a similar system and the artwork in those books is top tier.

2055,6,1jf5d81,"I just wrote a post on bringing new players into the OSR and tackling common objections, especially around character death. Check it out!","Yo good Peeps of Earthfordshire!

Jimmi here from [Domain of Many Things](https://www.domainofmanythings.com/) serving up my weekly ponderings, for your consumption and pleasure 😁 This week - getting new players into the OSR.

In my experience, old-school play thrives on danger ☠️ but I've found a real issue persuading people who've joined the hobby via 5e and stayed there to try it out, because they feel like their characters are doomed from the start, and won't have satisfying stories to tell.

Fair play to them if they really don't want to explore the wider TTRPG hobby, but there's a whole other world outside that gated 5e garden, just waiting for em.

A good OSR game can be brutal for sure, but it should also be fun, engaging, and give players a fighting chance - if they're smart.

In my latest bloggadowndiddlydoo, I dig into what makes OSR challenges feel fair rather than frustrating (and also use faaaar too many Matt Mercer gifs). I'm talking about empowering players to balance risk, giving them real choices, and making sure every death tells a story rather than just feeling like a dice-flavored slap in the chops.

2056,7,1jf03id,Castle Amber Colossus encounter Homebrew variation,"I'm running my players through a chopped up version of Castle Amber and had them encounter the Colossus this week. 

Players are second level and I was looking for a way to run the encounter without just handing it to them or risking a TPK. Players seem to enjoy what I came up with. 

I decided there were cliffs with caves in the face in between the town and the direction the Colossus was coming from. I didn't want to hand this information to my players but one of them did ask about the neighboring terrain which was cool. 

After much discussion on strategy they decided to go scout out the caves and found they could access caves at various elevations from a ground level entrance. 

As they were strategizing that began to feel the ground shake and and debris falling from the cave ceilings.

One of the bards and the Paladin rode out to intercept the Colossus and lure it towards the caves with a homebrewed spell I call ""come hither"".

It took some doing to get its attention and get it to follow them but it chased them to the cave entrance where it reached in to try to grab them. Smashing its fist against the cliff-faced caused damage from falling debris to everyone (save for half damage)

The magic user and other bard we're up in one of the caves and the thief was on top of the cliff ready to repel down if needed. 

Magic user  got its attention with some attack spells, and The Bard played its instrument to draw it towards them. 

It's big old face was looking at the cave when the bard switched to the heralds trumpet they had gotten from the town loaded with the powder and successfully deployed it. (The second bard was chosen because they played a wind instrument so figured they had the strongest lungs, and the face of the 15-year-old player was priceless)

All in all it was fun to run. Took team effort and about an hour of strategizing before they executed their plan.",osr,1742399258.0,1,1898,348
2057,11,1jete1f,How to handle wizard spells?,"I am very new to OSR. My group comes from mainly PbtA and other ""story"" games but I am very interested in the storytelling potential of OSR and have roped my group into playing Shadowdark  -- mainly because of how easy it was to get started with that system. I'm running modules from tenfootpole's Best list. 

One of the things that inspired me to try the OSR style in the first place was this comment from a post from this sub about character progression:   
  
*But in an OSR game, there's no automatic spell progression-- they need to journey in and engage with the game world to find magic. Their spellbook becomes not an arbitrary series of choices, but a sort of trophy record for them. Every single spell was something they sought out, survived, and earned the ability to wield. That scorching ray? They had to best the necromancer of Skull Rock and pry the spellbook from his dead hands for that. Had to, because nothing was automatically handed to them over time.* 

This sounds very cool. I assume it's one of the 5e-isms of Shadowdark, but the wizard class does have a table of how many spells they're going to learn at each level, though they can also learn spells from scrolls. What I have been debating is whether to tell the wizard in my group that as they level up they won't be learning spells automatically, and that they're going to have to collect scrolls. My worry is that as the GM, I'm going to have to babysit the wizard having to make sure that they find scrolls everywhere as to not handicap them. Or just have a shop in town that sells the ""basic"" scrolls like Detect Magic, Featherfall and Magic Missile, but then that might kind of defeat the purpose and you might as well just let them learn spells automatically on level-up. 

Now I assume that this question has been pondered and answered a million times either on here or on various blogs, but I haven't found it, so I would really appreciate if you could point me towards a solution.",osr,1742378113.0,1,1968,356

Does the second sentence imply that if you have e.g. previously rolled the Boiler Room at depth 3, and then later the players go deeper from depth 10 and you roll the Boiler Room again, you draw a path from 10 -> 3 and they wind up back there again? Or is the ""paths linking disparate Locations"" referring to those random events that generate new paths, and you'd instead draw a path to a new Boiler Room at depth 11?

Dungeon Cores are pretty much the Hearts of the Dungeon from computer games like the Dungeon Keeper series, or War for the Overworld. They're also quite popular in the LitRPG and Progression Fantasy genres of speculative fiction. (I'm currently really enjoying *The Cabin in Always Hungry*, a Dungeon Core Horror Slasher series on Royal Road, which I highly recommend)

The main concept is that every dungeon has a core or heart that is at least semi-aware. As it claims victims, loot, and experience, it levels up and its dungeon gains levels, becoming more deadly, and getting better loot to draw in delvers/victims.

Which is absolutely the genre of its full color core book art, and seems to be the objective. But I don't think it's more image sparse black and white adventures really fall into that genre, because the whole genre of extremity requires a level of detail that the books' writing does not support, so when we without full color art it falls short of this genre aim. Primarily texture extreme horror requires more descriptive writing than most LotFP books have, and generally more space than most OSR adventures have room for. The main books I'm thinking of as comparison points are Stokoe's Cows and LaRocca's Things HaveGotten Worse Since We Last Spoke.

What I think LotFP adventures fall into more and why there is a divisive reaction to them is the hopeless and pointless nature of the horrible things rather than the extremity. More akin to the Descent, the Poughkeepsie Tapes, or the Smiles series than the grindhouse its art seeks to imitate. I personally think most (though not all) LotFP adventures miss the mark on what makes to of those three examples good and falls more into Smile territory, where the consequences are less of a ""how horrifying"" and more of a ""whomp whomp, anyways roll up new dudes"".

* Another project funding on Backerkit is [**Hit the Road Jack**](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/rv-games/hit-the-road-jack), a solo or duet game of high-speed, highway chases on the open road.
* Ward Against Evil has just released [**Aketon: Adventurer Options**](https://ward-against-evil.itch.io/aketon-adventurer-options), a supplement for the Aketon rpg. It's free, and even if you don't play Aketon there's bound to be plenty of inspirational material within.

2085,45,1jcman5,Wolves Upon the Coast Session 2,"I recently started running *Wolves Upon the Coast*, and it’s one of the best RPG products I’ve encountered. This blog series is my way of documenting the experience—both to share insights and to help others discover this incredible campaign.

**Previous entries:**

* [Intro](https://www.sqyre.app/blog/wolves-intro)
* [Session 1 Summary](https://www.sqyre.app/blog/wolves-session-one)
* [Foundry setup](https://www.sqyre.app/blog/wolves-foundry)

**Session 2: The Wolves Make Landfall**

*Days:* 3-7 (player-facing)

*Dates:* 4/2-4/6 (GM-only info for tracking seasons and holidays)

**The Wolves**

* **Arnsteinn** – Speaks Ruis, Brythonic, and Pictish.
* **Erik the Younger** – Speaks Brythonic and Pictish.
* **Gorm** – Originally named Coram O'Dorbog, renamed ""Gorm"" by the Pictish master. Speaks Ruis, Brythonic, and Pictish.
* **Iago** – Speaks Pictish.

**The Journey Continues**

As the excitement of Gorm’s boast to return with the head of the gryphon faded, the Wolves began to plan how they might overcome such a dangerous foe. Asking around, they learned that the nearby hamlet of Cloyne was devoted to the Old Ways of the druids — perhaps its people knew something about poisons? They set sail across the bay, arriving at the hamlet to find it populated mostly by children and the elderly, as the adults were at sea fishing.

The old folk were suspicious of the strangers, but assurances of peaceful intent — and the promise that most of the Wolves would remain on the karvi — won them permission to approach. The villagers offered hospitality in exchange for help with chores and minor repairs while they awaited the return of their headman. Iago, outed as a Christian, was exiled from the hamlet and stayed with the men on the boat. The Wolves were rewarded with a meal of unpleasant fish and turnip stew. Gorm threw out his back helping repair a roof but found comfort in the arms of a friendly young woman who soon made him forget his pains.

When the adults returned at day’s end, they met Beyf, the taciturn headman. The old folk vouched for the Wolves, and after some negotiation, Beyf agreed to lead them to the local druid in exchange for 100 silver from the gryphon's reward. The next morning, in heavy rain, they set out for the druid’s craggy peninsula.

The druid was a sight: skin and bones wrapped in feathered jewelry and a makeshift feather skirt barely covering his ass. He listened to their tale and, for payment, offered to brew a sleeping draught that could be applied to the beast’s skin to put it to sleep — but only if they returned with a feather from the gryphon as part of the bargain. The Wolves agreed and made the muddy return journey to Cloyne.

The next day, rain still falling, the Wolves split up. Iago remained on the karvi, regaling the crew with dreams of founding Iagotown, where all men would be free. Arnsteinn returned to Culemwardern for supplies, securing large fish hooks and damaged nets that might work on a creature the size of a gryphon. Erik and Gorm braved the rain to fetch the sleeping draught from the druid.

Day Six brought fog, making the journey to Shoal — an island known for treacherous waters — too dangerous. The Wolves hunkered down and counted themselves lucky to no longer be thralls. The plan was set: they would sail to Shoal, bait the gryphon with Erik’s donkey, and dose the beast with the sleeping draught.

Day Seven dawned clear and warm. As they left the bay, another ship approached from the southwest, flying a red sword on a black background. The captain, a large red-bearded man, warned them away from Shoal. He introduced himself as Raghall the Red, a free captain from the city of Guthram across the channel in Albann, and invited the Wolves to join him and Queen Dar in the free city. The Wolves thanked him but made no promises, pressing on toward Shoal.

Shoal loomed ahead — a towering spear of rock rising from a turbulent sea. The Wolves circumnavigated the island, searching for a landing spot. They managed to beach the karvi and haul the donkey halfway up the rocky slopes before the terrain became too steep. As the gryphon returned to its roost, they doused the donkey with the sleeping draught. Their own shouting was drowned out by wind and waves, but prodding the donkey made it bray loud enough to draw the gryphon’s attention.

With a bloodcurdling shriek, the beast launched from the pinnacle — a true monster: crocodile head, wolf forelimbs, lion hindlegs, and eagle’s wings.

The session ended on a cliffhanger as battle was about to be joined!

**GM Thoughts on Session 2**

*General*

I was really happy with how much happened, even in our shorter Foundry sessions. The combination of the density of the *Wolves* sandbox and the light rules meant we were able to fly through scenes.

*Random Encounters*

As an old-school sandbox, *Wolves* has a robust set of random encounters for land and naval regions. I've been pre-rolling weather, wind, and encounters, which helps keep the game flowing instead of figuring things out on the fly.

*Reaction Rolls*

*Wolves* uses a common old-school mechanic, the **reaction roll**, to determine the disposition of NPCs. Roll 2d6 — high results are friendly, low results hostile. I used reaction rolls liberally for the villagers, Beyf, and the druid. The dice were in the Wolves’ favor, making for a smoother journey — a trend that’s continued across several sessions.

*Saves vs. Tests*

*Wolves* has two mechanics for non-combat rolls: **Saves** and **Attribute Tests**. Climbing Shoal raised the question of which to use. In the spirit of **Rulings over Rules**, I ruled that since we'd started with Saves, we'd use them for the rest of the session and discuss the approach between sessions.

*Gryphon Design*

Luke Gearing’s *Wolves* bestiary takes familiar monsters and makes them weird. I was tempted to use his gryphon but decided to roll on tables from *The Monster Overhaul* by Skerples, which produced the crocodile-headed abomination. I want *Wolves* to push me out of my vanilla fantasy habits, and this weird hybrid was a perfect fit. Check it out on DTRPG [The Monster Overhaul](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/421868/the-monster-overhaul).

Next up I'll recap Session 3 which was the Wolves' battle with the Gryphon, a perilous climb, and reflections on player agency, rule adjudication, and game pacing.

Until then, good fortune in the wars to come!",osr,1742134283.0,1,6427,1057

It is a longer post, detailing 2 rooms but the particular thought I wanted to share is pulled out from the rest of the post in the excerpt below:

""Another aside - I am really having an internal debate about the role of hooks in an adventure. I know the classic ""TSR"" style is to have a bunch of hooks to be rolled randomly at the beginning of the adventure. It feels like a quantity over quality approach though. If I'm going to write a module and then put it out into the world for someone else to drop into their game then shouldn't I give 1 or 2 really solid hooks that are sure to catch their player's attention? And to me, a great hook has to HAVE A PAYOFF. Don't do fake hooks. Don't do generic hooks. Don't do hooks if the players bite they are underwhelming. Yay, gold! Who cares, wherever they go there will be gold. That's the point of the game.

GIVE THEM A MAGIC SWORD! If you give them a magic sword, the next time you throw a hook their way you know what they are going to do? They are going to bite. Every. Single. Time. Just keep giving them swords.

But you know what, I didn't just give them a sword. I gave them an NPC to interact with. I gave them an enemy - the Duke wants that sword. I gave them a choice, what can they get in return if they give the sword back to the Duke? I gave them questions. Who is this duke? Is he a good guy? It's a whole story that can be explored. At minimum its a new entry on the wandering monster table where occasionally some hired thugs from this random Duke somewhere else in the world show up and try to take the sword. Maybe the Peacock Blade wants to go back? Maybe Duke and Peacock Blade are in love?""

I was thinking of adding a similar mechanic to my game and wanted to get some feedback.  The rule would be this:  This could apply to Both Fighters and Paladins.  Each round the player would declare their mighty deed, much like in DCC,  If the player rolled a natural 18 or higher and hit the opponent the the deed would be successful.

2107,76,1jas2e3,Where Should I Start with OSR for Very New Players?,"I'm thinking about starting an OSR campaign with some VERY new players. They’ve only recently warmed up to the idea of D&D after playing HeroQuest with me, so I don’t really know what they like yet. I was considering running a Dolmenwood campaign, maybe starting with Winter’s Daughter or The Black Wyrm of Brandonsford.

The problem is, I don’t know where to find a comprehensive guide to Dolmenwood, and I’m unsure which system would be best. I first learned about OSR around six months ago when I discovered Old-School Essentials, but I’ve also heard about Shadowdark and Cairn.

Given that my players are completely new, where should I start? What system would be best for easing them into OSR-style play? Also, any recommendations on Dolmenwood resources?

This issue, written for Old School Essentials, provides rules and guidelines for advancing characters beyond their level limits (up to a max level of 20 for human characters) that mashes up standard level advancement with the BECMI rules for achieving immortality. It provides a few different options for level gain requirements (straight gold = XP, setting character goals, accumulating mortal worshippers on the path to divinity) that can be combined or used individually, as well as expanded advancement tables.



It also starts a look at the domain of the dead, the kingdom of Negrorn, a silent, frozen land ruled by seven lich-lords.

2112,82,1ja9gru,Mass combat events in OSR setting,"Hi,

i'm playing Hot springs island using Dragonbane. This is an OSR setting about multiple factions wanting different things and the players characters come in the middle and basically alter the status quo.

There are some random events that might involve battles between factions, and some battles can have a large number of participants (up to 50). I'm looking for a way to manage that **without standard initiative-based combat** (which the characters wouldn't survive) but still allow some decisionmaking and interesting results for the players.

I was considering implementing ad-hoc moves like pbta, but i'm having a hard time since in normal encounters the characters already have their hands full with one or two enemies, and it would stretch credibility to have good rolls solve too much. Plus, they are not commanding anything right so it's not they can order other warriors arounds.

**Are there any easy, narrative but still character-influenced systems i can bolt on for this?**  
I am imagining something like ""select up to 3 bad things to happen to you in exchange for equivalent number of combat objectives to achieve"" but a little more indepth or nuanced.

I successfully adjusted most rules that I need but can't wrap my head around astromancy to make it usable by me.

In the book it's more akin to ""Space Magic"" which I'm opposed to because I don't want my setting to be magiteck. Hell, some of the astromancy spells are copies of actual DnD spells.

I do have Psionics already and they work in a a classic way: influence world directly using Power Of The Mind (reminds of Wizards). In practice effects are less flashy than magic could be. So instead of throwing a fireball, Pyrokinetic just combusts a zone and everyone in it. This works for me.

Astromancers should have recieved their abilities from *some cosmic entities,* (should remind clerics and warlocks?) but I have two problems:  
1) How they should work in a different way than Psionics mechanically? In theory they should have less control over more powerful effects but that seems like a bad design.  
2) How effects should look so they don't still seem like ""space magic""? Temporal and space-bending effects are sci-fi enough but are pretty niche.

Most of the content is based on Gary's notes:

> **Who is Writing It?**
> Volume 1, _The Citadel_ is written by Gary Gygax. This is the content some of you have in Yggsburgh, previously published by Troll Lord Games in 2004; it will contain updated art on the cover and interior, plus new maps.
> 
> Volume 2, _The Castle_ is written by Jeffrey Talanian. This originally appeared in Upper Works, published by Troll Lord Games in 2008. It will also feature an updated cover and new interior art, as well as new maps for more seamless play.
> 
> Volume 3, _The Cellars_ includes one level written by Jeffrey Talanian (the 1st). The rest is being written by Michael Stewart. Mike has written and published a number of adventures through Troll Lord Games, and his writing style fits Castle Zagyg perfectly. Couple that with his work on Yggsburgh alongside Gary Gygax, and he is the perfect candidate for the task. He is back on board to pore over Gary's original notes and maps and to create the dungeon that many of us have longed for, and many more never knew they wanted. 

Castle Zagyg will be published for the TLG's [Castles & Crusades system](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/86/troll-lord-games/category/44934/castles-and-crusades-fantasy-roleplaying?affiliate_id=2150725), meaning it is broadly compatible with TSR's D&D editions and other popular retroclones.

I run casual adventures on the AD&D 2e/1e system for four teams of adventurers and I noticed that within 1 discord server a micro community started to grow, recently I was interested in their conversation about ankhegs and whether damp earth conducts electricity and whether it can also conduct paralysis from one of the wands and that it would be cool to test it sometime



Since let's call it team A was in the dungeon and team B in the wild, I agreed that this time it could be done beyond the narrative of giving the created artifact to team B and paying them for the tests





Then the concept of a channel on Discord for exchanging magic items was born for me, which allowed me to stop being afraid that the artifacts that the BG would encounter would be too useless.

1. During the movement and missile phase, can players move some distance fire a missile and then move again? I couldn't find anything that outright said no, and the only hint was that it says movement, or missile attack once in the quick rundown of the phases, but in the longer explanation of the phase it doesn't seem to make it either/or. Since we are all 5e players and a turn is a whole minute I ruled it was OK.

2. If you use a missile attack, can you then use a melee attack? Again I didn't see anything specifying one action per turn, and the only hint is that some missile weapons allow for more than one attack in a turn. I ruled it was okay for now, since a turn is a minute, and it seems very possible for someone to do both in 1 turn if they want.

I know OD&D is rulings over rules and the original white box wasn't very specific itself so in general I made the assumption that it's up to me to decide, but if there is a rule in the book and I didn't find any answers I just went with what was fun for the table.

Also, the **Classic: Adventures** booklet says the following about using THAC0 directly (subtracting monster AC from THAC0 and using that as the target to hit with the attack roll):

>Note: Using THAC0 to resolve attack rolls results in very slightly different attack probabilities than when using the traditional approach of referring to the attack matrix.

How? How on Earth would it result in different probabilities?

**Example:**

A 4th level Fighter THAC0: 17 \[+2\] wants to hit a Goblin AC: 6 \[13\]

Using the attack matrix: To hit DAC 6 with a THAC0 of 17, you need to meet or beat 11

Using THAC0 directly: you need to meet or beat THAC0 - DAC = 17 - 6 = 11

Using Ascending AC: To hit AAC 13 with an attack bonus of +2, you need to meet or beat 11

After running my first few one shots of Knave 1e, I thought it was the perfect system for my latest homebrew RPG project - a game with anthropomorphic woodland animal races and dark fantasy flavours, like Redwall meets a Jim Henson film. I wrote it all up, made my PDF with interim art, created my character sheets and ran my first playtest session with a few friends. 

After running my first sesh (a raccoon had stolen a book of Raise Dead from an ancient wizard's crypt, using skeletons to steal from a nearby village) I had a great time, but encountered a problem. After divvying up all the coin found, each player came out with 166XP, which really didn't seem right - Knave advocates for level up every 1000XP, which seems ages away. 

I may not have put enough loot in there for a level 1 mission, but I'm already thinking of reducing the level caps and adding extra ""do-gooder"" bonuses for milestones reached and NPCs helped along the way.

2142,115,1j8mgmk,Hex mapping software,"\--SOLVED--  
There's a hex map extension for Inkscape ( [https://github.com/lifelike/hexmapextension](https://github.com/lifelike/hexmapextension) )and although I do have to draw the symbols myself, it's propably the best option at the moment. Simple enough to use, at least, if you're at all familiar with Inkscape (or even Illustrator, thought they do have different workflow and UI, you should pick up Inkscape relatively easily if you know Illustrator (I know I did)).  
I tried it for a moment, and it's easy to snap the symbols to the center of the hex. Now all I have to do is start making the map symbols...

I am looking for a hex mapping software, one that I can download and use from my computer. Worldographer is not the one I want based on the trial version, it feels clumsy and awkward to use with quite the learning curve. Is there any alternatives?  
I'd like to make OSR style maps, so fe. Inkarnate or Wonderdraft are not what I want either. I should just be able to plop map symbols on hex grid. I've made something with Inkscape, but with that I have to center the symbols by hand, not to mention I have to draw them which is not a huge issue, but the need to center the symbols manually is a deal breaker. Might there be some plugins or somethign for Inkscape that does the trick?  
I've been looking around for some time now, and it seems that there isn't a downloadable software that does this simple trick, or am I completely wrong? I would rather not draw them by hand, be it on paper or computer.  
In the meantime, waiting for responses, I'll look into the Inkscape options. I have some idea how to approach, but it might requite a bit of prep.",osr,1741683686.0,1,1672,297

Pangea Ultima is a proposed supercontinent that will form in about 250 million years when the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas merge. It's also known as Pangaea Proxima, Neopangaea, and Pangaea II.

The barely-there city setting of *TUD* (which I elected to make a hodgepodge of renaissance Venice and Edo) serves as a minimalist, safe home base to populate with *Diablo*\-style vendors, shop stocks updated with new gear once a session.

2164,144,1j6rrhv,The Unhallowed Sea,"Been working on some Cosmology for my campaign setting(Celestria). [The Unhallowed Sea ](https://dragonsdrinkfree.com/2025/03/08/the-unhallowed-sea/)is where Devils call home within my setting. Fair warning my writing tends to be a little ramble-y, and I definitely use the word ""Devils"" way to often in this...but overall I'm happy with the concepts behind it.

Beyond the material plane lies a quiet place. A somber plane of existence where Devils dwell and an eternal fog covers a quiet sea which connects scattered islands. Though the Unhallowed sea seems a restful place at first glance, its eerie expanse is one of great danger. Beneath the calm pale waters leviathans dwell, and the islands that break up the expanse are the domains of Devils.

# The Devils of the Sea

Devils are beings of Law and contract. They bargain for the souls of mortal beings, striking complex deals in exchange for a sentence to be served by the soul after death. It is said that no Devil may pen a contract in which a soul is bound eternally. Each contract has a stipulated term of purgatory before a soul will be released to whatever after plane they are drawn. That said, while a Devil will never break letter of their contract they are masters of complex logic and precise dealings, their contracts are trapped with tricks and loopholes that extend and obscure the length of a souls sentence. Few souls who find themselves bound to a Devils power ever see themselves released. This trickery is vitally important to them, for Devils grow in power only through accumulation of bound souls. The more souls they have bound, and the longer those souls remain bound the more powerful a Devil becomes.

Devils gather themselves into Firms. Coalitions of service in which one or two elder Devils are at the top, and many others serve under them. Lesser Devils serve under the elder Devils of the firm, giving up the majority of the power earned through a souls acquisition in exchange for the protection and guidance of those above them. All Devils dream of the day they are either promoted to Partner within their firm, or instead have gained enough power and influence to strike it out alone and form their own Firm.

When Devils form a form it manifests as a physical space within the Unhallowed Sea. An island birthed into the fogs. As the firm gains more souls, and by extension more power and influence Their island grows, the sea ever shifting, reshaping, expanding and contracting to fit the needs of the the islands found within its waters. The greater the power held by a Firm the more distant it is able to stay from other islands within the sea. Additionally the fog grows more thick around their island, and more difficult to traverse. This is of vital importance for Rival firms are always looking to steal contracts and by extension the souls that are tied to it.

# The Leviathans below

While the Devils and their Islands represent a great danger to any that find themselves within the Unhallowed sea they are not the ONLY danger. Beneath the waters is the realm of the lost. The hunting grounds of great leviathans.

A devil without a Contract is no Devil at all. This is the very reason lesser Devils allow themselves to be tied into service. For without the power of bound souls to draw sustenance from a Devil starves. Sometimes occurs because they have had their contracts stolen. Sometimes because a Firm casts them out (a fate even Elder Partners are not always immune to). Sometimes it is because a foolish Devil may have over extended themselves, drawing forth more power than they had access to in hopes that they would be able to leverage that power to win big in the long run and the bet doesn't pay off, Burning out the souls in their possession and leaving the Devil in question powerless.

When this happen Devils have three choices (or perhaps two choices, and a consequence): They may Find another Firm, Find another Contract, Or wither into a husk and be thrown out like trash. The third possibility is where leviathans come into being. Devils cannot truly die, but being without a soul to draw sustenance from is a torment beyond comprehension. It leads to madness. The remnants of Devils cast into the Unhallowed sea roam there eternally seeking sustenance. Mindless beasts twisted in desire and shape. They can never regain themselves. Never again be what any Self respecting Devil would ever describe as ""A Devil"". But even that is not the end.

As clever and careful as Devils are in their contracts, and the defense of the souls under their power. Sometimes mistakes happen. Sometimes souls that should be bound manage to slip through the cracks. A stolen contract that is lost before it reaches a new Firm's vault. A contract that had an unexpected exit clause that leaves a soul without serving its sentence(and by extension release) while also no longer being held captive. And sometimes unbound souls from outside the unhallowed sea come into the plane for reasons of their own, but become lost. For whatever the reason sometimes souls find their way into the depths of those pale quiet waters… At which point all too often they are found and devoured by those remnants of Devils long gone to madness.

Feasting upon the lost souls allows those husks to regain power, but it is not a stable, long lasting power granted by a contract. Devouring lost souls is a savage, feral feast which sates their hunger for only a short time. The husks regain strength, becoming twisted monstrosities referred to as Leviathans. These beasts form their own ecosystem. Fighting for hunting grounds, devouring what souls they can, and devouring each other whenever possible. Few husks last long enough to fully achieve ""Leviathan"" status, as they themselves are fair game for whatever elder Leviathans might happen to find them.

Though they have not the delicate and precise power of Devils at their best, leviathans can grow to be of massive size and power. Some Devils of great power have themselves gone missing in the endless for of the Unhallowed sea, devoured by beasts from below.

Though their exact nature is hard to quantify it is said that if you can manage to ""slay"" one of the beasts you may carve away draw out its potent blood, carve away its flesh, and take its bones. All of which are enriched by great power and are of great value to those with the knowledge to make use of them. of course since no devil can truly die, even a leviathan corpse can be returned to the sea where it may itself be devoured by another, or perhaps will someday reconstitute itself to begin its growth again.",osr,1741470123.0,1,6612,1142

I'm a solo player and Basic Fantasy (BFRPG) is the only D&D-like game I've played besides Worlds Without Number (WWN).

I'm running a hexcrawl. I had two sessions with a party, then had a TPK. Pretty awesome too! 😆

My second party is two sessions in, And I've got serious questions having sunk my teeth into the rules. 

Looking at the way advancement works, the only real difference between a Lv1 Fighter and a Lv20 Fighter is +9 to-hit bonus and a bunch of HP. 

They still theoretically have the same:

- Ability Score
- Ability Score bonus
- Armor Class
- Damage output (1d8 sword)

That feels really really strange to me. I know magic users, clerics, and thrives get more abilities, but still their stats are static except for to-hit bonus and HP. 

WWN let's you gain +1 to an Ability Score per level a max of three times at least. 

Are higher damage weapons a thing in this game, and if so, whats reasonable?

Is a lv 20 Fighter using an enchanted sword that does 5d8+10 damage or something?

2208,199,1j35qx9,Lockpicking Failure Results in Time Tax,"I've seen a few people suggest this a way to handle percentile Thief skills, and I've also considered it. The way I imagine it working is that when a lockpicking attempt fails, rather than having the Thief be unable to even attempt that lock again until they gain a level, they simply expend a unit of time and get to try again. In an old-school format, I would expect that to be a turn (10 minutes). So, if it requires three attempts for a Thief to open a lock, then 3 turns/30 minutes/3 wandering monster checks are the most for success. 

Alternatively, it could only start taking entire turns after the first failure. So, if it takes three rolls to pass your Open Locks check, then it took 2 turns or 20 minutes. I think this latter option might be more reasonable.

I would probably add in some kind of fail state; maybe rolling 00 results in thief's tools breaking or the lock being simply impossible. Maybe different locks are of different difficulty levels and allow for a different number of attempts before being locked out of opening them.

The first consideration is whether it's a positive improvement gameplay-wise to make all locks passable. If all it takes is time to get past a lock, can that result in locks being too minimal of an obstacle? Can that encourage players to camp by a lock rather than moving through the dungeon trying all the locks they find, bottling exploration? Is the hypothetical replay value of impassable locks something worth keeping?

A second consideration is simulationism. Since you can attempt to open a lock many more times in 20 minutes than you can in 20 seconds or so, you should be rewarded for spending time on it. At the same time, though, it surely isn't the case that any lock can be opened by any lockpicker if they just spend enough time doing. Maybe there should be a limit to how many lockpicking attempts you can make; maybe 7. If you can't get it in an hour, then it's probably hopeless.

The third consideration is class balance. The old-school balance between Thieves and Magic-Users with Knock is that one is free while the other has the cost of a spell slog and the opportunity cost of not memorizing a potentially life-saving spell. With the standard rules, Knock usually knocks Thieves out of the park. With unlimited or minimally limited lockpicking attempts, Knock is only valuable in terms of saving time, as, either way, that lock is getting opened.

Maybe a fourth consideration is if the low odds of success with Thief skills encourages an old-school, creative style of play by usually requiring you to think outside your class. But that's a can of worms...

What do you think? Do you allow Thieves multiple attempts to pick locks? Do you think my solution of giving unlimited attempts with each failure after the first costing a turn is a reasonable solution? Or would you pick some other system? ",osr,1741074600.0,1,2871,505

2213,204,1j2ytm5,Deep-Dive: Running High-Stakes Narratives & Moral Dilemmas in an OSR/OSRIC Game,"After writing my next module, *N1: Desperate Dusty Desperados*, I thought it worthwhile to share some insights on running high-stakes narratives and moral dilemmas in an OSR/OSRIC framework.

There’s a persistent myth that OSR-style adventures are all about dungeon crawling and tactical combat, and that heavy roleplay or ethical decision-making don’t fit. I disagree. The best OSR/OSRIC games aren’t just about survival—they’re about player-driven storytelling, and that includes tough moral choices.

I wanted to share some practical insights for DMs who want to introduce meaningful moral dilemmas into their OSR campaigns without railroading players or undermining the game’s core mechanics.

# 1. The Art of the No-Win Scenario

One of the best ways to raise the stakes in an adventure is to present choices without an obvious ""correct"" answer. These aren’t just about binary “good vs. evil” dilemmas—real, gut-wrenching decisions arise when both sides of an issue have valid perspectives and real consequences.

For example, in *Desperate Dusty Desperados* has this as one of the possible encounters.

**Stoats and Spiders**: A group of *lawful neutral* stoats is forcing captive *lawful evil* rats (orcs) to process cochineal into red dye. Freeing the rats could be an act of justice or a foolish blunder as they later raid and pillage a nearby settlement. Do your players act on principle or pragmatism?

# How to Apply This in Your Games

* Make NPCs complex, not caricatures. Even villains should have motivations players can understand, even if they don’t agree.
* Don’t dictate a solution. Lay out the problem, let the players solve it.
* Tie choices to lasting consequences. Let decisions echo forward. A freed enemy might return with allies. A town might remember the party’s mercy—or see it as weakness.

# 2. Player-Led Problem Solving

A common pitfall when introducing moral dilemmas is structuring them like puzzles with a “correct” answer. That’s antithetical to good OSR/OSRIC play. Instead, the best dilemmas are the ones that emerge naturally from the players’ choices.

For example, if a desperate mining town is on the verge of collapse because bandits are cutting off supply lines, the dilemma shouldn’t be a pre-packaged “do you fight the bandits or not?” Instead, let the players explore the problem from multiple angles:

* Can they broker a deal between the miners and the outlaws?
* Do they raise a militia and risk turning the town into a battlefield?
* Would they try to outmaneuver the bandits, sneaking in supplies and avoiding direct conflict?
* Is there an alternative trade route that no one has considered?

The trick is to present problems, not solutions. The best moments in OSR games come from players inventing their own ways forward, rather than picking from a menu of DM-approved options.

# How to Apply This in Your Games

* Frame choices as emergent problems. Instead of ""Do you help the NPC?"" ask, “This NPC is in danger. What do you do?”
* Encourage creative problem-solving. Reward ingenuity, even if the players sidestep your expected solutions.
* Let the dice decide. OSR-style games thrive on uncertainty. A noble idea might fail spectacularly. Let it happen.

# 3. The Importance of Reputation & Consequences

A great way to reinforce moral choices is through in-world consequences. If the players choose to ally with a faction, that decision should close off some doors and open others. If they betray a group, they shouldn’t just suffer a loss in “alignment points” (who cares?)—they should hear about wanted posters, bounties, and whispers in the dark.

* Double-Cross or Loyalty? The party is offered a high-paying job—but what they’re not told is that accepting it puts them at odds with a powerful faction. What happens when they realize they’re working for the wrong side?
* A Reputation Earned, Not Given. The local sheriff doesn’t trust outsiders, but after witnessing the party’s actions, his attitude changes—for better or worse.
* Enemies Hold Grudges. A bandit leader, humiliated but alive, might come back for revenge later. But if the party killed them, the remaining gang members might scatter—or swear a blood feud.

The best moral dilemmas never fully go away. They linger, shaping the world in subtle (or dramatic) ways.

# How to Apply This in Your Games

* Use NPC gossip & rumors. Let the world react to player choices in a natural way.
* Make alignment matter, but in-world. Not with mechanics, but with how people treat the party.
* Reintroduce past dilemmas later. Maybe that bandit they let go is now the leader of a growing warband.

# Final Thoughts: Moral Dilemmas & OSR/OSRIC

Running high-stakes narratives doesn’t mean you need deep backstories or scripted drama—it just means letting choices matter. In *Desperate Dusty Desperados*, I built dilemmas into the setting itself rather than scripting them into a linear story. The key to making moral dilemmas shine in OSR/OSRIC-style play is to let players find the hard choices on their own—and then let them live with the consequences. If you are interested in the module, the kickstarter is at [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/miceoflegend/mice-of-legend-desperate-dusty-desperados-new-dnd-module](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/miceoflegend/mice-of-legend-desperate-dusty-desperados-new-dnd-module)

2214,205,1j2ssdv,Trying to remember where I found a specific really excellent blog post on making Hex Maps,"I'll give what I remember here: 
- it was more focused on how to think about the map than pointing out actual tools to use or anything like that
- it was a series of posts spread across maybe 5-8 entries or so? My brain is saying 6 but that could just be conflating my memory with ""hex""
- gave a lot of detail on how to make realistic landscapes in a specific order - starting with the topography, determining mountains and valleys and then understanding where water would flow according to that, etc etc and eventually moving on to monster ecology and I believe faction interplay toward the end, though that could be from elsewhere. 
- the way it was developed reminded me a lot of Dungeon Masterpiece's political geography videos, but it was more physical geography, and how that influenced other aspects of physical geography for much of it. 
- old school looking blog, author was an older player from the 70s-80s I believe. Background was black 
- logo had some sort of goblinoid or troll or some kind of creature in that vein - I recall him being fat and a bit grotesque. I want to say he was green and the logo was red lettering on yellow background but it's been long enough I'm not sure that's right. 
- I feel like the blog's name had in it either ""Grognard"" or troll / hobgoblin / whatever the logo creature was
- I want to say it's at least 5 years old, possibly closer to ten or more.

* [**Wayward Words** ](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ggoods/wayward-words)is a late entry into the Zinemonth festivities and could use some support. It's a system-neutral supplement of weird books arranged in alphabetical orders; each book has something unique to teach the reader.

2223,215,1j2951l,Colonial Village Horror Module Advice!,"Hi everyone,

I'm working on a colonial village horror module inspired by [Colonial 'living museum' villages](https://www.osv.org/), Lovecraft, and Bloodborne, for a modern OSR TTRPG.

The basic premise: A colonial village of farmers that stayed largely un-industrialized. Priest in the town discovers an old unfinished underground ritual eldritch complex built by a 1600s evil scientist and his slaves (the slaves and some witches revolted and escaped).

The priest is now trying to perform a ritual to meet an eldritch god, so he's kidnapping people in the town for sacrifice, and dumping the leftovers of their bodies into the nearby pond, causing the beavers in the pond to become fucked up evil carnivore cryptids that make their dam out of corpses.

The players are coming to the old middle-of-nowhere town because they heard about the cryptids, or missing persons, etc.

I know this is similar to Against The Cult of the Reptile God, so I'm looking to that for guidance. I will probably need a small hexmap/pointcrawl, a few dungeons (the ritual complex, the old mansion, etc.), some factions (the priest and his followers, the last witches, the townspeople?).

2234,234,1j15fmy,Light source dice rule — torch or lantern ?,"Hello,

At my table, we've been using the light dice rule for **wolf-packs and winter snow** (might be from another RPG originally but that's the one I know it from). For those who don't know, basically a light source has its own category of dice (like damage from weapons), from a d4 for a humble candle to a d6 or d8 for a torch or lantern. Each time you get in a situation where the light might be extinguished (like getting shoved), you roll the light die and on a certain number (1-2 or 1-3 depending on your system), the light die loses a category (from d8 to d6, d6 to d4, and eventually d4 to darkness). Additionally, you roll the light die once every hour or so (might be more or less, I like the 3 turns logic personnally for a more horrific type of play).

My question to you is, which should be the higher light die, a torch or lantern ? Some at the table have argued that the torch is more likely to get extinguished by strong wind or humidity, but that the lantern is more likely to get broken by any type of shock.

I ask for thy guidance, O Great Old Ones, so you may light my way throught this insignificant conundrum.

I run a low fantasy campaign but the party has entered Elfland or the realm of Faery so I could run over the top stuff like this. 

Takes place in a castle and the party sat down to a feast. I used almost the entire description but entirely eliminated the ""ghostly"" aspect of the scene. The players enjoyed the detailed description of each course. I use some of the side effects from consuming each dish but ditched the save versus death on two of the items as that definitely would not have been fun.

There was a boxing match scene, and I decided to make the champion a satyr instead of the written character. He strutted about like a pro wrestler. Started chasing around a dwarf jester around the room first (rodeo style) and after knocking him down the offer went to the players to challenge him.

I did the unarmed damage as written but on a roll of an 18 he would head butt with his ram horns for 1d10 damage. There was a lot of laughing as three of the players decided to challenge him.


I put all of the greenhouse scenes out in an actual Forest. 

I used to the squirrels and their acorns. Rather than being greedy, the party actually made a gesture of kindness to the squirrels in the squirrels reciprocated. 


They met the lady and the unicorn. A warlock character has a owl familiar and she has a telepathic bond with. The owl was flying overhead and so came back and gave them news to what was up The path. One of the bards decided to sing a song as they approached and they heard the unicorn gallop away but met the maiden. She gave them some information relevant to them quest.

These days I have just two to three hours per week for our in-person game to play so I just pull encounters that I think would be the most fun and change them up a little bit to fit my world better and time it out for the actual session.

2246,248,1j0dwly,Seeking advice for the execution of solo/co-op OSR playing.,"My wife has expressed interest in giving ttrpgs another shot. A couple years back we played a duet session where she was the player and I was the GM, but she didn't like it at all. I think she'd be more comfortable if I played alongside her and we did it in a GM-less style.

I have quite a few solo supplements, but I seem to struggle with the actual EXECUTION of playing solo. I understand all the concepts and how they should work, but every time I attempt to play solo I just can't seem to get the ball rolling. 

For those who play this way, what is your actual process of playing? I'd like to have a higher comfort level before I play with her so that things go smoothly.",osr,1740765493.0,1,677,132
