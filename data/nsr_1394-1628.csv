1c6ssoc,"My son saved my life with 40K and D&D, trying to figure out how to thank him","I honestly didn't know where to post this, but I needed to get it off my chest.

A few years ago during covid, my marriage and my life fell apart. It had always been rocky, but one day out of the blue I come home to find that my house had been completely trashed, my kids had moved out with their mom, and I was left alone. To make matters worse, I had lost my job and had a hard time finding another one due to the epidemic. I was actually, at 43 years old, making sandwiches at Publix. So here I am, no money, no kids, in a trashed house with even my pets gone. And I have some chronic health problems that due to not having insurance, were going untreated. I was falling apart mentally and physically.

I honestly considered suicide, but I could never do it because of my kids.

My son was into 40K and he said that he wanted to start playing on the weekend.  I managed to get an eBay credit card and lucked out finding a fully painted space marine force for 300 bucks. Every Saturday we would go to lunch and then to the game store to play. His new stepdad was pretty well off, so he was always playing different armies, but I played my space marines.

I was so poor that sometimes the rest of the week me and my new cat would share eggs for dinner. He never said anything, but he started paying for his own lunch. Then he would buy kits here and there for my favorite army, Orks. He would build them. He said it was so he could have someone to paint with.

Eventually I found a decent job and got mentally well enough to start putting my home together again (I won the home in the divorce, which is another story. I deserved it). I started my old D&D game back up. People would come and go, but he was there every other week. Never missed a game unless he was out of town.

Cut to now, I have a very good paying job, a wonderful girl that I plan to marry, and am happy, if a bit scarred. He still comes over to play and paint, and he makes sure I go to the gym with him four days a week as well.

We don't talk about feelings. We don't hug. I don't know how much of this was a plan to help me or just spend time with me, and how much of it was him wanting to play games. If I tried to thank him, I know he would freeze up and wouldn't be able to talk.

I want to thank him for saving my life but I don't know how. I have literally opened my mouth to say something a dozen times and couldn't get the words out.

  
(edit) I should add that my girlfriend is a huge part of this as well. Most of the rebuilding was due to her help. I just left her out because I don't have issues thanking her and telling her how I feel, but she is as awesome as he is.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bf92c6b0>,rpg,1713408703.0
1iiloeu,"I love you all, but when a 5E-Only player says they wanna try to branch out...","...for the love of Cthulhu, *stop recommending PbtA games*. I'm begging you.

I am glad you like PbtA. I am. I love this community and I think it's great that PbtA has such enthusiastic fans. But I swear to Crom, it is a TERRIBLE idea to recommend a PbtA (or PbtA adjacent) game to someone just barely peeking their head out of the Cave of 5th Edition.

It's like if someone in Cleveland said, ""hey, I'm tired of the place I usually eat, do you know any other good restaurants?"" and you recommended something in PARIS. Yes, I'm sure it's very good, BUT IT'S TOO FAR FROM WHERE THEY ARE NOW TO BE A USEFUL SUGGESTION.

RuneQuest. Shadow of the Demon Lord/Weird Wizard. DCC. Pathfinder. There are plenty of games that are still crunchy high fantasy with fun combat systems that AREN'T 5th edition, things that will broaden a 5E player's horizons without making them bluescreen. I know a bunch of you are Apocalypse-pilled, but one of the things PbtA fans seem to love about it is that it is SO VERY DIFFERENT from ""traditional"" rpgs (which 5E clearly is). Maybe - JUST MAYBE - giving someone who only knows 5E a game that requires them to COMPLETELY REBUILD THEIR CONCEPTION OF HOW RPGs WORK is... I dunno, *a little much*.

With all the love in the world, I ask you to be gentle with them. They're trying. Steppin' out of their comfort zone. Please don't throw 'em into the deep end right off.

EDITED TO ADD:

For everyone who said that what's *really* important is to find out *why* someone wants to try stuff outside 5e and *what* they are looking for before deciding whether to suggest a PbtA game, I have two responses to make:

1. This is an *excellent* point, the kind of thing that really moves the conversation forward constructively, and I agree 101%.
2. In my entire time in this subreddit, I have never once seen a PbtA fan actually ask what someone is looking for in a game-rec before jumping in to suggest a PbtA game.

1cpupus,"Hey, it's me, the guy at your table who only wants to play D&D. After three years of trying other systems, now I get what my problem is.","So I'll be the first to admit I'm exactly the kind of player who makes it hard for you, the person reading this, to play other games. I'm sorry! I've been playing one campaign or another since mid-2014, which is exactly long enough to experience a decade in the hobby without ever needing to play something other than 5E.

But I've been lucky! Of the two main groups I'm in one has never broken away from 5e, but another started branching out into other systems three years back because of the DM's burnout. I'm glad we did, despite all my stubborness along the way. Of the last three years, one was spent entirely on a level 1-10 campaign of Pathfinder 2E, with the other two years jumping between Shadowdark, Mork Borg, Blades in the Dark, Monster of the Week, and finally a Heart: the City Beneath campaign that's ending next week — I haven't  cared much for any of them, though PF2 was probably my favorite of the bunch. I'm probably going to politely bow out of this group before the next campaign in favor of a second 5e table, since I know I'm no more likely to enjoy the next thing they decide to play.

But now I know for sure it's not them. ""Them"" being the other systems, though the other players aren't at fault either. It's me.

There was a time when I would have said I don't have the time to learn other systems. The truth is, I like playing 5E because it asks the least effort out of me. This is fundamentally different from being a hard system to master, because with the exception of PF2E, all the other systems I've tried are less mechanically demanding. Its that D&D 5e is, by far, the system I can put the least amount of effort into while still being an active contributor at the table.

Our GM pitched Mork Borg, and then Shadowdark, by talking a lot about Old School D&D and the movements behind it, with the player-facing problem solving and the lack of solutions ""on the character sheet."" The thing is, I LIKE the solutions being on the character sheet. I don't really mind how lethal those systems are, but I immediately missed being able to solve a problem by rolling the right skill for it. Outside of combat, those OSR games feel more like your DM is running you through an escape room with the amount of time you spend asking questions about the environment and trying to figure out what gets you through dungeons. If I'm playing a character who is a thief, it's because I want the skills for being good at a thief on my table so I can roll to do ""thief things"" when I need to and carry on with the night.

Same with BitD/MotW/Heart, but from a different angle. Those games DO put your skills on the sheet, but the way the conversation plays out at the table is constantly demanding improv on everything else. I was constantly getting frustrated with the DM turning the questions of how I was doing things back on me, and how much those games demand you to narrate things outside of what your character does.

PF2 is close to 5E, but building out the combat the way it does put too much pressure on me most the time to really figure out what was going on in combat and make tactical decisions and use three actions ""wisely."" Most classes in 5E have one, maybe two things they do on their turn, and once you learn them you almost always know what to do when it gets around to you.

And I know that sounds bad. I know! I know this basically all sounds like ""you prefer 5E to these other games because you have to actually try to play them?"" But the answer is actually yeah, exactly! It's not that I'm checked out on my phone or something, but I've learned I'm not actually interested in thinking too much about my part at the table. I think being there at game night with friends is fun, but I mostly just want to be along for the ride until it's time to roll some dice to hit something and let the other players figure out what to do otherwise, maybe get in some banter-in character in between encounters, and chill. In everything else I've played, I'm dead weight if I'm not actively participating. In 5E, I can just kind of vibe until it's time to roll to unlock a door or stab someone, and I'm not penalized for doing that. The game is neither loose enough that it needs my constant imput outside of combat, nor complex enough to need any serious tactical decisions. That's a very comfortable spot for me!

So yeah. I imagine there's a lot of players who would prefer other systems if they tried them, but I'm not one of them. And I imagine there's actually a lot more people like me at tables than you'd expect! Hopefully this gives some insight into why someone would still prefer 5E over everything else, even after giving a lot of other games a shot.

1cnj1lp,The GM is not the group therapist,"I was inspired to write this by that “Remember, session zero only works if you actually communicate to each other like an adult” post from today. The very short summary is that OP feels frustrated because the group is falling apart because a player didn’t adequately communicate during session zero. 

There’s a persistent expectation in this hobby that the GM is the one who does everything: not just adjudicating the game, but also hosting and scheduling. In recent years, this has not extended to the GM being the one to go over safety tools, ensure everyone at the table feels as comfortable as possible, regularly check in one-on-one with every player, and also mediate interpersonal disputes.

This is a lot of responsibility for one person. Frankly, it’s too much. I’m not saying that safety tools are bad or that GMs shouldn’t be empathetic or communicative. But I think players and the community as a whole need to empathize with GMs and understand that no one person can shoulder this much responsibility.

I am the author of an indie-rpg called **Slay the Dragon!** and today it came to my attention that my game has been used to start a heated argument which went as far as the post being tweeted by Indestructoboy. I am writing this to share a perspective of a creator being on the receiving end of the stick because and also to share why I think that rhetoric presented by OP is actively harmful to what he wants to achieve.

**By being oblivious to the context, you are actively discouraging foreign authors from attempts to publish abroad.** 

In certain countries such as Poland where I come from the access to D&D is not as easy as in USA. It might be expensive, it might be hard to get, and it might not be available in the local language altogether. I created Slay the Dragon to be affordable, have a box set form and be easily accessible due to the generic fantasy theme. The game was warmly received, so I decided to share it with the international audience. By being ignorant to that context and claiming it’s just another unnecessary take on D&D, you are making it harder for us to do it. 

**Instead of complaining about D&D, give few indie games a real shot and you might actually see that a lot of them are more similar to the games you mentioned as ones you like.** 

Everything will be D&D if you are so desperate to see it everywhere. I won’t deny, yes my game is about dungeon crawling, yest it uses the popular d20 die and yes it is written with generic fantasy in mind. But it is also so much more. It actually makes dungeon exploration a mechanic within the game. And it binds this mechanic with combat and other parts of the game via the system of abstract resources. Resources that are abstract in order to bring a little bit of the joy of spontaneous creativity from story games into it. But to get all of that, you actually need to read into the game. Please do not make superficial judgments, just to have something to complain about.

**The post as the one that started the conversation might be enough to bury a project such as us together with all the love and work we gave it.** 

It’s incredibly hard to be an indie creator as it is. For me, publishing my games is a way of sharing results of a process I love. My game didn’t start as a scheme to make a quick buck. Me and the illustrator of the game who is a dear friend of mine wanted to create something together, and so we did. Hundreds of hours later, we had something we were proud of. But that’s only a small part of the battle, as we have to reach an audience. And without marketing resources to rival corporations or being in the inner circle of people who like to fashion themselves indie-rpg content creators, it’s really hard task. So please, for the love of god, think about the consequence of your actions.

1cnc7vw,"Remember, Session Zero only works if you actually communicate to each other like an adult. ","Yeah, yeah, this *should* be obvious, but right now I'm watching five months of investment in a campaign implode because people at the table agreed to a session zero, sat down, and then failed to fully voice their expectations and boundaries for the game. I reserve the right to vent a bit.

When our group sat down for our preliminary session of *Monster of the Week*, I walked away feeling like I'd hosted the ideal setup. MotW is a game where character creation is also worldbuilding, so players are effectively building out the campaign from first principles at the same time they're building out their characters. It's the ideal time to nip any concerns about content in the bud. I printed off a common safety checklist, we went around the table doing our Lines & Veils, and we had an open discussion about what we wanted the campaign to be about; on paper, we did everything you're supposed to do.

One of the playbooks in MotW is ""The Monstrous,"" a character born of the campaign's main chosen monster-faction but currently rebelling against their kind. One player quickly settled on playing a vampire-spawn hunting her own kind, and took the ability to mentally dominate humans as a starting ability. She wanted to play a character who struggled a bit with her own toxic impulses and the ease with which she could manipulate other people, because she was interested in playing the kind of character at serious risk of eventually becoming a Keeper-controlled threat, as is one of the fates that can befall The Monstrous as a playbook. As a full group, we discussed our level of comfort with these themes, revisiting our Lines and Veils to discuss how far we were willing to let this go in-game. We set our hard lines, we all agreed emotional abuse was not a line or veil; to reiterate, *we did everything you're supposed to do*.

Except, I guess we didn't. Five months later, eighteen sessions deep, midway through an adventure partially concerned with either freeing the Monstrous character from her curse or losing her to bestial hunger, another player has said OOC they don't want the character on their team anymore. She's crossed too many lines, used too many people; in their opinion, it's deeply uncomfortable that we're discussing redemption for this kind of character at all.

And I'll admit that I'd noticed the friction once or twice before now. Long, quiet streaks after scenes where the Monstrous used her powers to flippantly command civilians, and especially after scenes where she'd use this power on another player who played her partner to shut down arguments (with both players' full consent in playing out a toxic relationship). It's why I'd reached out to this player, repeatedly, checking in to make sure everything happening in the game was okay with them. I was told yes. Now I'm being told no, it's been upsetting them more and more for months, and they aren't having fun playing as a character who would associate with this other PC. In fact, the whole concept has been upsetting them from the start.

Why wasn't this brought up during session zero, when everyone was invited to set their boundaries for the game? *""Because everyone else seemed so excited about the idea,""* so they didn't want to rock the boat.

And I guess... I don't know. I don't know what I could have done differently. I sat everyone down, asked them to discuss what they were comfortable with playing, invited them to reach out in private for anything they felt uncomfortable disclosing in front of the group, and blatantly had that ignored until it festered into a problem beyond salvaging. Everyone is angry at each other now, and losing either player is going to take at least one other player with them, killing the whole game dead in the water.

I get that there's a lot of social awkwardness in this hobby, but what's even the point of building such a culture around safety tools if players are going to be too conflict-averse to use them? We had every chance to solve this five months ago, on the ground floor, before we'd invested all this time into a story at least one player quietly resented the whole time. Just, fuck, man.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c03ac680>,rpg,1715194248.0
1fbklo7,I think I realized why I don’t want to play D&D anymore,"It’s the fucking D20 dice mechanic. 

I’m 47 and have been playing since AD&D. But I’ve found myself in a situation where I feel like I have to min max my D&D characters for them to be fun. 

When I roll up a fighter, I have to optimize every weapon, feat, and subclass for combat because 1)it’s such a huge part of the game and 2)even if your character is reasonably good at something, the d20 is so swingy that unless you’re TEH BEST you have these feel bad moments where your supposedly capable character comes off feeble because of the dice. 

Those kind of ridiculous failures then make it hard to pursue the narrative ideas I have under-pinning the character.

To get around this I find myself playing characters with more open-ended abilities. Mask of Many Faces and minor illusion come to mind because they allow so much consistency and flexibility. But why can’t I have that kind of open-endedness or expect that kind of internal consistency with all classes?

I might try the whole “roll 3d20, choose the middle value” approach to kill some of that swingy-ness. Draw Steel seems interesting because of the 2d10 roll mechanic. 

I’d love to play D&D, but that just kills it for me. Any other alternatives?

Edit: First off, thank you everyone for such an amazing discussion. There are discussions around everything from dice mechanics to DM style to whether I secretly love min-maxing. 

This topic seems to be a Rorschach test of some sorts and that’s fair because the topic goes beyond just the dice roll. The reason I love this hobby is because it’s personal. It’s so innately human and everyone has brought that fully to this discussion. Thank you. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c04e2ff0>,rpg,1725752884.0

1c1mtnq,I told my group I'm burnt out on dnd 5e during our over 2 years campaign. This is how it went.,"Recently I asked for tips on how to tell my 5e group that I am burnt out on dnd 5e as a system and our years long campaign in [this post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1bwsrky/tips_for_breaking_to_my_players_im_done_with_out/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

When I read such posts from other people I always think to myself ""hm, I wonder how it went..."". So here's how it went.

We met on a non-gaming night to welcome back and plan the return of a player who was on baby break for a while. Once we all set down and before anyone even poured themselves a drink or opened a beer, the players just kept chatting and telling anecdotes and epic stories from the campaign to catch up the returning player. It really did well to remind me how excited everyone still is and how invested they are into all these crazy events and NPCs and character developements that happened so far. Unknowingly they really amped up my own excitement again as well. Maybe we should meet without playing and just shoot the shit and chat about the game, rpgs in general and irl stuff more often.

Originally I planned to end the campaign after a few sessions to get it to a satisfying conclusion at the end of the current story arc / adventure. It was in that moment I decided that the campaign deserved another chance. But I am really just fed up with dnd 5e and need a break. Maybe after the break I'll be more excited again to continue even if the system likely won't ever be something I consider very good. 

So I spoke up, said I wanted to announce something and told them how I felt but focused on the positives and mentioned how awesome seeing everyone absolutely hyped for our campaign just then was. However I need a break from 5e and want to run like a half a year palette cleanser adventure in a different system and different setting for them after the current story arc concludes. 

And not only was everyone super understanding and agreed to do that. Once we talked about it people got really excited and suggested settings and systems and ideas. I took some notes on which genres, settings and types of games people want to play. All players are open to very different systems such as narrative, OSR or even more avant-garde stuff and many different genres from cyberpunk to low dark fantasy and even super heroes or wuxia games. So I will compile a very short list of games we'll pick from together once we hit the break point in the current game. After that I'll run at least one more story arc and then re-evaluate again. The players said that sounds great to have a change of pace after every or every other dnd adventure. 

TL;DR: I will give the campaign another chance even though 5e doesn't excite me anymore. But everyone was more accepting and even excited to try new things. Having the most amazing people play at my table admittedly helps. Maybe my experience encourages some people in a similar situation to speak up to their group.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c0725fd0>,rpg,1712861253.0
1isd218,Is Dungeons and Dragons currently behind a $200 paywall?,"EDIT:  I'm clearly using ""paywall"" incorrectly here....I ought to have said ""buy in"".

EDIT EDIT: I'm not looking for alternative games or cheaper ways to play D&D, just looking to discuss the vibes.

And if so, why is it still so ubiquitous?  I keep toying with the idea of getting back into Dungeons and Dragons, and maybe even playing it online, but the ""official"" experience of owning all three books and playing online with DnDBeyond feels like it would be at least a $200 up front buy in.  Is my impression correct?  I'm sure there are ways to cheapen it up, but it's really hard for me to grok that this is not only the most well known game, but is it now the most ""elite"", or ""executive experience"" in roleplaying games?

For a number of reasons I won’t get into I no longer want to run dnd 5e. However whenever I pitch other games this friend gives huge push back and basically goes to “buy you can homebrew that in 5e”. No matter the mechanics, setting, theme, etc. 

I got the pathfinder starter set and have been dying to run it. The rest of my group is either very excited or happy to try it with an open mind. But this friend is grinding the brakes again and is having an attitude best described as “this is stupid, I’ll play under protest and just complain about how dumb it is” and keeps trying to convince me to run 5e more. 

I feel sort of stuck. I don’t want to kick out my friend but also if I hear “but you can run a super hero game in 5e” again I’m gonna strangle someone.

I tried updating it by replying to it, but no one seemed to seethe reply. I am bad at reddit. So I will update here, and if you're interested, you can read the original.

I ended up sending my son a text. I told him that I enjoy the time I get to spend him with these days, but when his mom and them left, it was the thing that really kept me going. I thanked him and told him I appreciate him. I didn't manage to get out an ""I love you"" . I told him he didn't need to reply. he never did.

But he did come over for roast chicken tonight, and he showed me how to not suck quite so much at Dark and Darker, so I assume he got the message and he's not feeling too awkward to be around me. Thanks guys! Old post below.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I honestly didn't know where to post this, but I needed to get it off my chest.  
  
A few years ago during covid, my marriage and my life fell apart. It had always been rocky, but one day out of the blue I come home to find that my house had been completely trashed, my kids had moved out with their mom, and I was left alone. To make matters worse, I had lost my job and had a hard time finding another one due to the epidemic. I was actually, at 43 years old, making sandwiches at Publix. So here I am, no money, no kids, in a trashed house with even my pets gone. And I have some chronic health problems that due to not having insurance, were going untreated. I was falling apart mentally and physically.  
  
I honestly considered suicide, but I could never do it because of my kids.  
  
My son was into 40K and he said that he wanted to start playing on the weekend. I managed to get an eBay credit card and lucked out finding a fully painted space marine force for 300 bucks. Every Saturday we would go to lunch and then to the game store to play. His new stepdad was pretty well off, so he was always playing different armies, but I played my space marines.  
  
I was so poor that sometimes the rest of the week me and my new cat would share eggs for dinner. He never said anything, but he started paying for his own lunch. Then he would buy kits here and there for my favorite army, Orks. He would build them. He said it was so he could have someone to paint with.  
  
Eventually I found a decent job and got mentally well enough to start putting my home together again (I won the home in the divorce, which is another story. I deserved it). I started my old D&D game back up. People would come and go, but he was there every other week. Never missed a game unless he was out of town.  
  
Cut to now, I have a very good paying job, a wonderful girl that I plan to marry, and am happy, if a bit scarred. He still comes over to play and paint, and he makes sure I go to the gym with him four days a week as well.  
  
We don't talk about feelings. We don't hug. I don't know how much of this was a plan to help me or just spend time with me, and how much of it was him wanting to play games. If I tried to thank him, I know he would freeze up and wouldn't be able to talk.  
  
I want to thank him for saving my life but I don't know how. I have literally opened my mouth to say something a dozen times and couldn't get the words out.  
  
(edit) I should add that my girlfriend is a huge part of this as well. Most of the rebuilding was due to her help. I just left her out because I don't have issues thanking her and telling her how I feel, but she is as awesome as he is.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c196e390>,rpg,1713658213.0
1ip9kf2,Chickens should have been the stereotypical first enemy instead of rats,"There is a well-known stereotype of a freshly-baked hero and their first task - getting rid of some rats in the basement.

But rats don't fight people. They are active at night and they are smart. They will hide and run as long as that is an option. That's why we've used cats and traps and ratcatcher dogs - because humans fighting rats in a straight combat does not make much sense.

Chickens on the other hand are active during the day. In a medieval settings they should be everywhere. Chickens are ferocious fighters - in some places they have been used for cockfighting before even being used for food. Roosters have long and sharp spurs - long enough to gouge arteries of an adult human with an unlucky strike. In fact, chickens are the smallest animals that have rarely, but consistently killed adult humans through force (and not with venom, poison, infection or an allergy).

TL;DR: The stereotypical first task for a hero should have been a farmer asking them to get rid of their rooster that became too aggressive to handle.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c19dfbc0>,rpg,1739536391.0

My players typically claim they prefer crunchy rule sets such as DnD, d100 games such as Warhammer , etc. Yet they never actually  learn the rules and rely on the GM to guide all rules resolutions.

However when we have played games that I've wanted to GM such as Black Hack, Mechahack, and other low crunch games they learn all the rules, but claim they're too shallow.

1d8325h,Learning RPGs really isn’t that hard,"I know I’m preaching to the choir here, but whenever I look at other communities I always see this sentiment “Modifying D&D is easier than learning a new game,” but like that’s bullshit?? Games like Blades in the Dark, Powered by the Apocalypse, Dungeon World, ect. Are designed to be easy to learn and fun to play. Modifying D&D to be like those games is a monumental effort when you can learn them in like 30 mins. I was genuinely confused when I learned BitD cause it was so easy, I actually thought “wait that’s it?” Cause PF and D&D had ruined my brain. 

It’s even worse for other crunch games, turning D&D into PF is way harder than learning PF, trust me I’ve done both. I’m floored by the idea that someone could turn D&D into a mecha game and that it would be easier than learning Lancer or even fucking Cthulhu tech for that matter (and Cthulhu tech is a fucking hard system). The worse example is Shadowrun, which is so steeped in nonsense mechanics that even trying to motion at the setting without them is like an entirely different game.

I’m fine with people doing what they love, and I think 5e is a good base to build stuff off of, I do it. But by no means is it easier, or more enjoyable than learning a new game. Learning games is fun and helps you as a designer grow. If you’re scared of other systems, don’t just lie and say it’s easier to bend D&D into a pretzel, cause it’s not.

1czm1a2,Unpopular Opinion: ANY Miniature Will Work,"I work part-time at my FLGS and I (Me) had a very usual interaction with a customer (C) the other night.

C: Do you have any other centaur miniatures? The Nolzur's one is too buff.

Me: {thinking she was going for a dad-bod centaur, fantastic idea, be different!} Let me see what else we have in the system... okay, the only other centaurs we have are for the Kings of War games by Mantic. {walk her over to wargames aisle} Here... and here.

C: Oh, they have horns, my character doesn't have horns. {proceeds to do the thing every FLGS employee dreads, tell me about her character's 15 page backstory}

Me: {nodding and smiling while the elevator Muzak plays between my ears} Okay, that sounds interesting! But I'm sorry, these are what we have. 

C: {thinking it will help} Here, I built him in Hero Forge, this is what he looks like. {proceeds to show me fairly generic centaur fighter character, that looks just as buff as the Nolzur's one we have on a peg, no dad-bod to be seen}

Brief interlude, because my brain is screaming at this point - even if you don't have your own 3d printer, you can create a character to your specifications in Hero Forge and pay them to print it for you. Even if you can't afford the $20 for the cheapest, unpainted, ""not premium"" plastic, for a mere $13, they'll make you a colored plastic standee that looks pretty good and is easier to store and transport. 

Me: You know they will print those for you and sell them to you, right?

C: Oh yeah, but that's too expensive.

Me: {more grinning and nodding and gritting of teeth}

Look folks, we all want to put a miniature out onto the table that looks EXACTLY like how we picture our PCs look like in our heads, but it's not going to happen. Unless you go to the trouble of rebuilding them in Hero Forge every time they have a change of gear and pay for the expense of reprinting them, which most of us can't afford or be bothered to do. Which now begs the question of what you're doing with the old mini when you've replaced it, but that's a different conversation. So what miniature will work for us? The miniature that you can afford, whether it's a generic Nolzur's/Bones/Deep Cuts plastic, or a wargame metal/resin, or a plastic standee, or even a paper tent mini you've downloaded from the internet and printed on your employer's color printer when no one was looking, as long as you can recognize it from across the table and differentiate it from all the other miniatures on the table. That's it. This isn't tournament level WH40K where everything has to be WYSIWYG, close enough is all we're looking for. And if you can't afford the string of self or professionally printed Hero Forge or similar minis, ""good enough"" will just have to work for you.

Sorry folks, rant over. What are your experiences with miniatures at the table? And yes, I struggle with this in games other than D&D, any system that allows use of miniatures has seen this issue come up at one time or another.

1g3ozcb,Does anyone else feel like rules-lite systems aren't actually easier. they just shift much more of the work onto the GM,"This is a thought I recently had when I jumped in for a friend as a GM for one of his games. It was a custom setting using fate accelerated as the system. 

I feel like keeping lore and rules straight is one thing. I only play with nice people who help me out when I make mistakes. However there is always a certain expectation on the GM to keep things fair. Things should be fun and creative, but shouldn't go completely off the rails. That's why there are rules. Having a rule for jumping and falling for example cuts down a lot of the work when having to decide if a character can jump over a chasm or plummet to their death. Ideally the players should have done their homework and know what their character is capable of and if they want to do something they should know the rules for that action.

Now even with my favorite systems there are moments when you have to make judgment calls as the GM. You have to decide if it is fun for the table if they can tunnel through the dungeon walls and circumvent your puzzles and encounters or not.

But, and I realize this might be a pretty unpopular opinion, I think in a lot of rules-lite systems just completely shift the responsibility of keeping the game fun in that sense onto the GM. Does this attack kill the enemies? Up to the GM. Does this PC die? Up to the GM. Does the party fail or succeed? Completely at the whims of the GM. 

And at first this kind of sounds like this is less work for both the players and the Gm both, because no one has to remember or look up any rules, but I feel like it kinda just piles more responsibility and work onto the GM. It kinda forces you into the role of fun police more often than not. And if you just let whatever happen then you inevitably end up in a situation where you have to improv everything. 

And like some improv is great. That’s what keeps roleplaying fun, but pulling fun encounters, characters and a plot out of your hat, that is only fun for so long and inevitably it ends up kinda exhausting.

I often hear that rules lite systems are more collaborative when it comes to storytelling, but so far both as the player and the GM I feel like this is less of the case. Sure the players have technically more input, but… If I have to describe it it just feels like the input is less filtered so there is more work on the GM to make something coherent out of it. When there are more rules it feels like the workload is divided more fairly across the table.

1. Have a handful of games they've played and enjoyed multiple times

2. Have an understanding that different genres of games are better suited for certain players

3. Will be willing to give a new, potentially complicated board game a shot even if they know they might not love it in the end.

4. Are actually aware that other board games exist

* The basic format of ""describe scenario, and then ask player 'what do you want to do?/how do you react?'"" comes from War Games, which often had referees in addition to the players.
* Early DMs debated a) whether players should roll dice, b) whether players should be allowed to speak as their character c) whether the players should even know the rules of the game when playing!

1e1oato,I dream of playing in a sterotypical party in a classical fantasy adventure.,"Feels like every game I am in and see is so... extreme?  It's always some epic tales about fighting gods, some witcher inspired ""grey"" fantasy, genre subversions with the DM's own social comentary, dark souls type dark fantasies, etc...

The parties are always some sort of overtly wild groups people, animal people, strange magical peoples, all sorts of Human but (Animal/Elemental/Magical trait infused) that are probably born out of the game designers fetishes.

Sometimes I just wish to find a group that would like to be... simple.  
Not be afraid to be typical. Everyone always seems to try so hard to be unique with their creations, that it seems to fall into the same sort of blur it all becomes. I wanna be the shy robed mage with a large brimmed hat with a drooping point. Or the Thief in leather armour, with an attitude and a love for coin and riches who'll grow to care for the party more than the riches they seek. I can be the introspective fighter, with a large sword at his back and a dark past. Or maybe the farmer boy, with a sword, shield, and a dream. A cleric in robes, travelling in dedication to their god.

I just want to play a simple game, where no one tries to be the special unique ones.  
Where we can simply fall in the stereotype of what we are and have fun. Without thoughts of ""making a story"", and simply letting it be made, by the things we do and the rolls we make... I want to go rescue villagers taken by goblins, delve into ancient dungeons, slay the evil necromancer... Fight dragons and rescue princesses.

Is this so strange to dream about?

EDIT: Thanks you all for the suggestions! I am looking into the games suggested below, and getting familiar with the OSR stuff.

1ey8bgr,"The new Paizo Fan Content Policy affects more than just 1e, and a highlight on the Infinite license.","EDIT: They have reinstated the CUP, thus alleviating most of my concerns below. :)

[https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6w469?Updates-on-the-Community-Use-Policy-and-Fan](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6w469?Updates-on-the-Community-Use-Policy-and-Fan)

---------------------------------------

**TL;DR:** Paizo replaced an old community use policy with no warning, which affected free tools and content, forcing them to either stop being updated, scrub all setting references and comply with ORC, or upload onto Infinite specifically, of which the Infinite license has its own concerns on exclusivity and rights to your work.

I want to talk about the new [Paizo Fan Content Policy](https://paizo.com/licenses/fancontent) (FCP), which replaces the previous [Community Use Policy](https://pathfinder.fandom.com/wiki/Pathfinder_Wiki:Community_Use_Policy) (CUP) \[Sorry it goes to Fandom, it was the only place I could find it\].

There was another thread about it regarding specifically how it affects Pathfinder 1e and Starfinder 1e content, but I feel like a lot of people brushed it off and did not see that the policy affects more than that, as well as what the Infinite license it nudges people to has.

For some personal stuff, I'm a big PF2e fan, I started learning to GM to be able to get games of it running with my friends, bought books to support it, and pushed my friends to try it out, even labeled myself a 'PF2e Fan' in a Discord for another game where people keep on complaining about PF2e constantly. This is me being concerned about these changes and want to bring more discussion about it up to see what people think when they actually look at it because some of these don't feel like just ""protecc from hasbro"". Hopefully discussions with others will put me at ease, otherwise it hopefully will put more eyes on what I think are concerns.

I am not a lawyer, I am a tired regular ol' person fan with too many thoughts whizzing through my head, so, if I have made mistakes/misunderstandings here I will try my best to correct them.

# The Community Use Policy

The very simple run down of the CUP is that it was a policy that allowed people to create stuff for Paizo products, using Paizo material, provided that they weren't charging for access to said material. Lots of folks used it, and others noted it being very easy to digest (being a policy made for fan projects) without having to worry about itty bits. Being able to use names also made it far more accessible and easy to use, as you could just look up the things you were interested in and not try to figure out naming differences ""Okay, this says ""Sun Deity"", which one was that again??"" or ""I built my character using this feat–Wait, what's the actual name for it? Uhm."" It also let people make stuff like expansions to APs, such as fleshing out characters and locations and adding additional content ideas.

* AONPRD and the Foundry VTT PF2e System were built using this license originally, and got propped up by Paizo eventually \[with the latter particularly adding an extra cash flow to Paizo with premium modules\].
* Other notable tools and resources which used the old license which are now affected are: Dyslexic Character Sheets, [pf2e.tools](http://pf2e.tools), Hephaistos and Wanderer's Guide
* This also affected fan translation site/databases (though Mark commented he would look to rectify that), fan made APs set in Golarion, possibly fan made classes/archetypes too (I'm unsure about this one), Foundry Modules that may have names or mechanic references that aren't specifically pulled from the base PF2e system (such as, say, modules to run said fan made APs or to add fan made classes/archetypes)

# We reserve the right to terminate this Policy at any time.

During the OGL debacle, and the rise of the ORC, [this blog post was made](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sid6?Update-from-Paizo-President-Jim-Butler) on 19th of July, 2023.

>""**The shift to the ORC license will also necessitate a change to our Compatibility License and Community Use Policy. We’ll have those available for public comment soon,** and final versions will be released before the new Remaster books come out in November. **We’re also taking the opportunity to introduce a new fan policy I think many artisans are going to love.**""

Bolded are that they would have to change the Community Use Policy, but will have a public comment period over it. And that there would be a new fan policy.

However, on the 22nd of July 2024, with most Paizo staff already packing up and preparing to leave the following week for GenCon, [this blog post was dropped announcing the Fan Content Policy](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6vh12). (If you want a deeper dive, I recommend also reading through the comments where there was a lot of back and forth discussions between players, creators, and Mark)

In it, people found out that this new fan policy completely replaces the Community Use Policy, effective immediately. This new policy disallows the usage of Paizo rules texts (such as monster stat blocks) and setting (such as Golarion) completely if you are using it for 'RPG Products' \[""Game modules, adventure modules, board games, video games, roleplaying simulators, character generators, rules compendiums, sourcebooks, or other such products are not permitted under this license""\].

In the comments Mark Moreland noted that those affected would have a grace period of 'try to be reasonable' to work on modifying all the names to comply with ORC, **or will be grandfathered in if they make no more changes starting now.** (Side note, those that were already on Infinite were given until September to finish anything up before the no OGL stuff kicks in, but I'm not wanting to focus on the OGL stuff here.)

The grandfathering item particularly affects resources that are hosted on websites or are modules for VTTs. All of those free tools earlier mentioned (that did not get a special contract with Paizo) now effectively have to halt all of their work, not so much as a minor bug fix can go through without them now breaking the new license that they find themselves in. Foundry Modules or other VTT modules that may have relied on the old license will potentially die without updates since it means they can't maintain themselves to new versions of the VTT.

While the CUP was not an irrevocable license and could be modified/terminated at any time (per the heading of this section), and it is obviously within Paizo's right to do what they want with their IP, it was still surprising to do so without warning with how much good will I feel Paizo had built up around it, and the earlier blog post noting that the CUP would be modified with a public comment period.

These were passion projects. ""Just change the names"" sometimes isn't as easy as it is when you didn't build ground up for it, and sometimes may diminish the point of some of these projects. And more importantly, it may just diminish the drive that the creators had to make them in the first place. It can't feel nice to have this fall on you for something you might have considered a big bright point of Paizo, where several commenters noted they loved Paizo for being so nice to make tools for. I am not sure if tools like aonprd or the Foundry VTT system would have grown to have become as big as they and thus also helped Paizo in return.

# The Infinite License

So what are your options? Either you:

* Scrub names out to comply with ORC (which may be difficult, time consuming, and/or diminishes the point of some items)
* Be big enough that Paizo negotiates a special license for you ([as is the case with Hephaistos](https://www.reddit.com/r/starfinder_rpg/comments/1ew0m92/no_hephaistos_update_today_again/), though he notes wishing this hadn't had to be done in the first place, and ponders how many other creators will get this privilege extended to them?)
* You publish on Infinite (but only if your item is for 2e).
   * Infinite isn't particularly a great place for hosting tools such as character builders. Foundry modules will be awkward (Not very user friendly, and also harder to find). Collaborative efforts like the PF1e to 2e conversions via Github will be far more awkward. Adventure Paths and new classes/class expansions would be the main thing. B**ut they cannot ever upload it elsewhere**, which would possibly even include if they wanted to make a version where they scrub all the names out to make it ORC compliant and put it on a Foundry module or other VTT.

With this, I want to highlight the Infinite agreement, [which Paizo forum user Redeux noted some key points here.](https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6vh12&page=last?New-and-Revised-Licenses#mprd_post_v5748gbiwz3x9) \[Disclaimer; also not a lawyer\]

The points highlighted by them were:

* You are granting rights to your work without reversion to Paizo/Roll20. This is irrevocable, royalty-free license to develop, license, reproduce, publish, distribute, translate, display, perform your work in any language, and any future means. They can also make derivative works under full copyright ownership of your works.
* You may not publish, recreate, distribute, or sell your work on anywhere other than Infinite, Roll20, or other platforms offered by the Publisher. \[It is not in the license text which other platforms are allowed, making it uncomfortably variable\]
* If you are banned or otherwise removed from the platform, Paizo and Roll20 can still use your work and make derivatives of. They'd have to pay you for sales of your original work, but not if they make a derivative of it.

It's not just Paizo that has the rights here, but also Roll20, a different company entirely. With the new fan content policy trying to funnel people into this platform. As a layman, it's a little hmm.

While I don't believe Paizo would instantly and intentionally use this for all the worst case scenarios, but this is asking for a lot of trust, and I'm unsure that such trust should be given so easily, especially not with the recent events that lead up to this, especially not with how suddenly this is now pushed on people. Especially with a company who I feel has been given so much by their community made tools. Plus hands can change over the years, perhaps future owners might not be so nice.

I also do not believe this is anywhere as big as what WoTC did, so please don't fight over comparing that. :(

1d5viu3,"Light-weight low magic fantasy system, with social support?","Recently I've started to crave a very specific kind of system, but nothing I've looked at quite scratches the itch. It's possible that I just haven't looked closely enough at the games I examined, or what I want is too specific in vibe, but I figured this was the place to ask.

Here's my wishlist for the type of game I'm looking for:

- Low fantasy setting. I'm not opposed to players having access to magic, but it should peak at fireball casting level at most. Maybe sword and sorcery? 
- Something that supports longer campaigns. I'd like something that my players and I can keep coming back to and get invested in
- Something that supports a more open world theoretically, i.e. isn't confined to a specific place.
- Lightweight combat. Something that runs very easily theatre of the mind, and preferably where combat isn't the default solution (but is viable).
- Better support for social encounters than ""I roll a single die and get everything I want"". Burning Wheel's Duel of Wits is maybe a bit overboard though.

So far everything I've looked at doesn't feel quite right. Knave would be a good candidate, but from what I could tell it's mainly dungeon crawling. 

Sword of the Serpentine also sounds promising from what people have said, but I'm slightly worried it's **too** investigation focused, and by default confined to a city.

Some sort of FitD system could probably be appropriate, but I often feel like the rules propel you forward more than I'd like in this particular instance. I'd want to turn to the rules to resolve ambiguity, then return to letting players do what they want. In other words, a game where the rules get out of the way when not needed.

1h9qgdg,Thoughts after wrapping up a Wildsea campaign,"*I always seek out reviews of lesser-played systems, so here's my review of* [*The Wildsea*](https://www.myth.works/collections/the-wildsea-homepage)*. To know if my RPG tastes align with yours, check my past games* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1bm9uk3/roses_thorns_from_every_ttrpg_ive_ever_played/)*. For the TLDR, skip down to ""Perspective after playing.""*

[Quinns' review](https://youtu.be/c29Ecut4K_E) of The Wildsea really excited me, so I got it to the table for an 8-session campaign that ended early after we all agreed it wasn't our jam. Here are my thoughts.

# Perspective before playing

These are the reasons I was excited:

* The **worldbuilding**, presentation, layout, and art. It's a gorgeous ~~book~~ PDF. I love worldbuilding, so seeing someone succeed at productizing their imagination so well was inspiring.
* The **roving**. I usually run campaigns with major story threads, and was excited for something more freeform. Not quite a hexcrawl, but I intended to let players steer the story and use journeys to generate points of interest as we went.
* The **languages**. I cannot overstate how much I love the way languages are used. Each has 3 tiers of proficiency and doubles as a knowledge skill related to its primary culture's domain. This feels so much cooler than ""I leveled up so now I speak perfect Elven, but we'll all use Common anyways.""

# Experience during play

We made it 8 sessions using the core rulebook, including 2 sessions spent playing through the official one-shot [One-Armed Scissor](https://felixisaacs.itch.io/the-wildsea-one-armed-scissor). My players went full Monster Hunter; everything was focused on taking quests to identify, track down, and kill notable monsters. We did feedback after every session. About halfway through, we agreed that the system wasn't feeling great, but opted to give it some more time. Also halfway through, I stopped prepping new material and went ""full improv,"" meaning the last 2 monster hunts (one small, one huge) were done with about 5 minutes of total prep.

**Unsetting questions were a bust... until they were our MVP**. We did these ""Tell me something that is false"" questions right away, and the group had no idea what to make of them. This was amplified by knowing very little about the world. As we revisited them, we made one crucial clarification: ""Tell me something that *might be* false."" Then it clicked. PCs would invent rumors they'd heard, I'd use the rumors but edit as necessary. By the end, these were our favorite part of the whole system.

**Character creation is easy, but contains a trap**. My players used the quick start rules and stitched characters together with equal contributions from their origin, bloodline, and post... but doing so created ""old dog"" characters who are powerful veterans with lots of abilities and good stats. Making ""young gun"" characters looked like more work to the players, so they assumed ""combine 3"" was the intended way to play. I should have argued harder, but didn't. It only took a few sessions for everyone to experience retroactive regret.

**Journeys did not work**. I'll try to summarize. Getting from A to B on your cool chainsaw ship involves assigning players to various roles (steering, lookout, engine) and making progress towards your destination. Except... player choices don't change much. The lookout is rolling to determine what you randomly bump into, but since they can't control it, the GM may as well roll. Most encounters will be cool distractions... but my PCs always set out on journeys with a goal of *getting somewhere*, so they ignored distractions. The best thing I can say is that by the ""combine a whisper and chart to generate a landmark"" was okay; by the end of our game, we reduced all journeys to a single whisper + chart, narrated a wacky resource-gathering scene, and moved on.

**The world is awesome -- and hard to expand**. I cannot overstate my admiration for the game's world. It's distinctive, cohesive, and vast (200+ pages). All of those strengths became weaknesses for us. We struggled to come up with ideas that were ""as cool"" as the published material. We also struggled to internalize the huge amount of existing lore, especially since I tried to shield players from a lot of the book (threats, reaches) to allow them a sense of discovery. As a result, our journey through this setting felt surprisingly uninteresting.

**There are too many rules**. I have a similar complaint with [Blades in the Dark](https://evilhat.com/product/blades-in-the-dark/), which I feel is a lightweight system trying to support slightly too much board game baggage. This system felt like it said ""Hold my beer."" There are 18 skills, all with very wide interpretations of use. You have a ton of different roll types, even though most have the basic ""good/okay/bad"" structure. You have pages and pages of aspects (powers), many with custom rules, even though most are used solely by invoking their name in a moment of narrative applicability. 12 damage types despite combat not being the main focus. Milestone advancement instead of XP. No one thing was ""wrong,"" but there was a lot more ""Let me look that up"" than felt necessary.

**Building ships is more fun than sailing them**. This is a direct benefit of the previous statement. There are 25 pages for building ships, and my players had a blast combing through upgrade options every time they had stake to spend. This was true even though Journeys (their main use) aren't great and ship-based combat didn't feel amazing either. Just the theoretical payoff of making their ship cooler was a sufficient reward.

**More random tables would be great, but there's still gold here**. With the world being so distinct, I'd love a few more random tables to help make journeys, reaches, and encounters easier to think up. The closest this gets is reach-specific Watch tables, but it didn't feel sufficient. I used a number of unofficial online random generators to help where I could. However, two things were amazing: randomly generating NPC characters and ships using the player rules. Because both are largely a serious of (incredibly varied) descriptive tags, you could trivially create a new NPC or ship and have it stand out.

# Perspective after playing

These were my takeaways afterwards:

* I wonder if I just played [**Fate**](https://evilhat.com/product/fate-core-system/)? We got the most mileage out of the system when we used its descriptive tags as game fodder (whether that be aspects, specimens, ships, or other).
* I'm less eager than I thought to buy a system for its detailed worldbuilding. Internalizing it was hard, but extending it was also hard.
* The promise (cool world, cool ships) didn't pan out for us, which left us feeling disappointed and ready to move on.

# Roses

* **Unsetting questions**. I often ask for player input, but ""Tell me something that might be true"" was really powerful. It gave me explicit permission to adjust player contributions, and let players contribute wild ideas without stressing about continuity up front.
* **Cool random tags**. If you set the rules aside, there were so many flavorful tags for everything: players, ships, specimens. It greatly helped with improvisation.
* **Cool shipbuilding**. Ships are detailed enough that just tinkering with them in port was still satisfying.

# Thorns

* **Overly complex**. Crunchier than Blades, for too little payoff.
* **Journeys were broken**. We tried the Journey rules every session but never got them to be fun. The closest we found was using ""chart + whisper"" once per trip and moving on.
* **Someone else's world**. The world was awesome, but absorbing or expanding it (while staying true to the vibe) turned out to be a struggle.

  
I'd love feedback on where I missed something obvious that might have soothed over a pain point.

1ejg4w2,"Rant: As a GM, I am so tired of medieval fantasy","Now, the first response you may think of could be ""Well, then don't be playing medieval RPGs"", and that's the problem, I'm not, and I feel like my life as a GM gets an order of magnitude harder because of this

Every ambiance music I look for, every map that I search, every tool I look up, feels incredibly D&D-y, and it makes finding things that are actually useful to me, in my post-apocalyptic horror setting, or my ~~cyberpunk~~ space action setting, or my modern world political drama setting, all the more difficult

When trying to prep for ambiance music, for example, I can't just look up ""RPG music"", since EVERYTHING that will pop up feels taylored specifically for D&D, with instruments, melodies and moods resembling medieval fantasy tropes

When trying to look up maps, I'm lucky if 1 every 10 maps can be used for my setting. When trying to find inspiration, I better have my own sources, otherwise the time to find something may be longer than the time to come up with something on my own

I don't want to come off as angry at the medieval fantasy enjoyers- one reason for it to be so popular is that it works well, but trying to find or prep things beforehand can be so exhausting when you're trying to deviate from the norm...

Edit: Ok, I'm going to make this explicit here- I won't be answering comments saying how I just ""don't need music"" or ""don't need maps"" or that I should just ""google better"". The point was never that I NEED those things to live and can't possibly get them, but rather that it is exponentially more difficult if you're not just medieval fantasy.

1jc57c4,I finally realized Crunchy RPGs makes it very fulfilling and satisfying,"I played Chronicles of Darkness/World of Darkness for about 27 years, which is medium-crunch, and we've been getting into rules-light RPGs for a few years now, but there was something that I couldn't really put my finger on with rules-light RPGs. I found rules-light RPGs fun, fast, and easy to get into. Mork Borg is such game for me. But I kept feeling like something was...missing. I kept reading and reading on the latest rules-light RPGs to try and find one that would fit my needs. And they somewhat did. But it wasn't enough. I felt empty. So one day I decided to give Mythras a try and it was a hurdle to overcome learning the rules and making a heavy character sheet. But after getting past all that, I realized it was really *easy* to play. Combat is crunchy still, but I found it satisfying. I could feel like I'm grounded in its world and I could feel like my character had meaning, even if he could die anytime. The character sheet made it feel alive and I realized it brought me the same feeling I had from Chronicles of Darkness, even if half of the stuff on the sheet wasn't used. Now when I look at rules-light ones, it feels like the character is ""floaty"" with barely anything on it and the mechanics are too simple - hit, miss, hit, miss, hit, miss. Nothing wrong with that, it gets players in faster with turns coming around faster. Like OSR. With crunchy rules, it makes you *think* strategically, where to position your character, how to encounter and solve problems,  and it's tense and exciting. It completely engaged my brain. Now, all of that being said, rules-light RPGs are *still* a great way to welcome new players that have never played before and might be something quick to pop out during a snowstorm when the power goes out or the apocalypse comes when boredom strucks or whatever.

1eknyov,"Your world is not what hooks players, it's the stories that develop in every game","Just something I had forgotten about but remembered while reading that post about leaving a con game:

One of the few times I've played online with strangers was a D&D game where the DM had created this elaborate, complicated world with extensive lore and details. We were all excited to play in it (we had met up online and gotten a preview of the world before the first session). Sounded so damn cool.

Session one comes in, and the DM simply *dropped us in the middle of a city with no goals or threads to follow*. I distinctly remember all of us looking confused as hell. Basically, it's a fine day in the city, y'all wake up, bla bla bla. Mind you that our PCs were not even together; he described the morning for each one of us individually.

Finally, my turn comes. ""Um, okay, I head out to the city's main plaza to check things out"".

GM proceeds to describe merchants and stuff that detailed their world lore.

""I want to walk around the plaza, looking for something unusual"", I say, trying to crank things up without being the asshole ""I punch an innocent citizen"" kind of player to falsely create action.

""You see nothing out of the ordinary, just the usual blah blah blah..."" He goes off describing more world lore and things.

This went on forever. We played a total of almost two hours. We were four players and in the end only two PCs finally met up (myself and another). The other two remained isolated. The session just sort of ended with no quests, no cliffhangers, nothing...

I never went back.

1inwwub,I recently finished GM'ing a 3 year Mutants and Masterminds Campaign. This is my review of the system.,"Three years ago I got an urge to run a superhero focused campaign, and after some research settled on Mutants and Masterminds 3rd Edition as my system of choice. Three years later I have finished said campaign, and want to share what I learned with others who may be considering it. This is less a ""is it good or bad"" review, and more a breakdown of some finer points of the system that are not as evident on a first (or second, or third, or twentieth) pass. If you are considering running this system, hopefully this will be helpful to you.

**The Power System:**

If you are familiar with M&M at all, it is likely because of the power system. Mutants and Masterminds promises to let you build any power. No matter how strange or unique, it will work out of the box. There is no home brew necessary, and you get it all in a single, visually appealing book (looking at you GURPS). At this it succeeds wonderfully.

In my group we had a shapeshifter, a teleporting shadow man, an elementalist whose powers were fueled by different emotions, a librarian who could summon people from books she reads, and a crab man with a collection of powers so eclectic it would make golden age superman blush. All of these, along with a small platoon of variably powered npcs, worked with minimal hiccups.

However, I don't believe this system will click for everyone. Learning M&M's power system is like learning a foreign language or coding. Some will intuitively get that their flurry of fist attack should be a damage 5, multi-attack, or that their mech suit will obviously need to be at least growth 4, but for others that will forever be gobbledygook. Players who put in the effort will figure it out eventually, but not everyone is going to do that. This is not a criticism of the system, it's just advice. If you want to run this, make sure you have players who are capable of cracking open a rulebook on their own time. And understand that, even if your players do put in the time, it is inevitable that someone will eventually get something wrong, and you will end up having to tell them that their cool new power doesn't do what they want it to do. 

Also, I highly recommend the Gadget and Powers guides. They are by far the most useful supplements.

**Abusing the Power System:**

I said there there were some minor hiccups with the power system, but they could be larger depending on your group. No one in my group went out of their way to abuse the system. However, some accidentally did just by making their character concept. One player who did this was the shapeshifter. His concept was that he was a biologist who could alter the makeup of his body. A cool and powerful ability. He even built in a weakness that he had to pass a biology check to use his power. However, we quickly realized that this meant he could alter himself to have ideal stats for whatever he was doing. There were drawbacks to this, but RAW not enough to keep him from being the perfect jack of all trades, and master of all as well. This frequently got in the way of other people getting their own unique thing. Thankfully this player realized this, and got out of other people's way, but a more obnoxious player could really ruin a session with this sort of thing. 

But that's fairly minor compared to the other player who accidentally broke the system. Our librarian was played by the most inexperienced player at the table, and her power was that she could summon people from books. An overpowered-sounding ability, but tempered by her needing to actually spend time reading the passage, and the people she summons being limited by her power. Or at least, that was the idea. In practice it turned out that summons are busted. This is not a problem unique to this system. Plenty of other system have this issue where summons break action economy, particularly when you can have multiple of them. Mutants and Masterminds compounds this though by you summon a small army for a fairly low points investment. This was the power I had to homebrew the most stuff for, as this system just doesn't have any practical rules for controlling large groups, and even then it would have been completely overpowered, had the person playing it wanted to break the power.

A players ability to break this system is only limited by their intent. There are tons of different things you can do with Afflictions, but if you aren't worried about flavor then some of them are just straight up better than others. Some of the ""negatives"" basically do nothing. Regeneration can completely invalidate Damage, and Weakness always seemed to give an extremely high value for how easy it is to land and how cheap it is points-wise.

These are small examples, and I've seen and come up with even crazier combos. Plus, I'm confident there's someone out there who has theory-crafted things well beyond what I've thought of. The point is, you need to understand going into the system that it can be pretty easily broken, and you and your players will need to figure out how you all feel about that.

**The Challenge:**

Mutants and Masterminds is a d20 system. A 1 is not an auto-fail, and a 20 is not an auto-succeed, though a 20 does give you an increase to your degrees of success or failure. Characters in M&M also tend to have high modifiers in the stats they care about. It is common for a character to have a +15 or even a +20 to certain rolls. In addition to that, there is also a meta currency called hero points which not only allows rerolls, but also guarantees the rerolls are better. What this all means is that players tend to succeed at rolls. This makes sense, they are superheros, but it changes the way you design encounters. An inability to fail is boring, so to make interesting challenges you either need extremely difficult tasks (DCs of 30+) or to deliberately target your players weaknesses. 

This may sound obvious when spelled out - that's how things work for superheros in comics and movies - but in practice this is actually quite hard. Not every encounter can involve kryptonite. Not every encounter can be the world ending monster. If you start at 11 you have nowhere to go. You want variety, but most smaller encounters are a waste of time. My group got around this in two ways. The first was role play - spending more time on character stuff. The second was world building that kept letting me raise the stakes. However, every group has a different approach to role play, and in a more traditional defending the city superhero setting expanding stakes becomes more difficult. 

M&M is also a high powered setting. Players can lift multiple tons, fly, teleport, go through walls, see into the past, etc. This is cool, but also invalidates most non-combat encounters. It's hard to have a murder mystery when a player can talk to ghosts. It's hard to create a heist when a player can teleport. You might think you can just not have encounters that your players can invalidate, but your players may have *a lot* of different powers. The only surefire way around this is to create systems that explicitly stop players from using their powers for these things. The villain has created an anti-teleport field around their base. The victim was killed with a knife that also absorbs his soul. Plenty of people dislike these sorts of workarounds though, and for good reason. It can be unfair and unfun to deliberately keep a player from doing their things. Besides it can be entertaining when a player just gets to feel powerful by invalidating some challenge. However, deliberately targeting a character's weakpoints is part of the genre, and invalidating a challenge once might be funny and empowering, but the more you do it the more it starts to feel boring. 

If you want to have a variety of encounters, and keep them fun and challenging, you will likely have to engage in a bit of GM fiat. If you are strongly against that, this system may cause you some problems in the long run.

Hero points are a double-edged sword for this. On the one hand, they encourage players to actively make use of their weaknesses. On the other hand, they are extremely powerful, and with careful use players can make it highly likely they succeed at everything. I personally found them too plentiful, and ended up making it so players keep them from session to session (with a cap), but only get them from doing heroic things or encountering their weakness. Before this change my players just treated them as per session re-roll batteries. After this change I found that my players were more proactive in thinking of how their unique weaknesses could affect them and get them more points.

**Combat:**

After three years of using this system, I can now confidently state that I do not like the way damage works. It seems simple. You make a save, and if you fail bad enough you are out. It allows for classic one punch scenarios while also letting two super-tough, super-strong characters duke it out. It even avoids the problem of slicing at the big monsters legs until it dies of a thousand cuts.

At least, it does this in theory. In practice the whole thing is much fiddlier than it first seems. AC is the defense modifier plus 10, then you make a toughness save, but that's damage +15. Then you get a stacking -1 from each failure, but not degree of failure, plus a further minus depending on the roll. This minus only comes from damage, so don't add in affliction failures, unless they also do damage. And if you have regeneration remember to remove the conditions first, then the -1, or was it the other way around? Also, whats the effect of 2 degrees of failure? 

The number of exceptions and edge cases can make it difficult for even experienced players to remember exactly how everything works. And the upshot is that sometimes you can attack for turn after turn and feel like you are doing nothing, and oftentimes a fight just ends in the least exciting way possible. This is not really a system that excels at random outcomes and divergent possibilities. It is a system where you play as larger than life characters engaging in epic battles. Put another way, immediately one-shotting Thanos because he failed his Will save is funny exactly one time.  

There are ways around this. Mostly be giving your big super-villains enough immunities that beating them turns into more of a puzzle than a traditional fight. For instance, maybe the psychic mummy king can only be hurt after getting the scarab amulet into his heart. But, his heart is on a space station in orbit and protected by a constantly changing laser grid, so players will have to go through that while holding him off. Some groups may like that. Some may not. Either way, it's not something you will learn how to do from the book. And, it requires you to sometimes ignore the specifics of the power rules for major villains. 

Finally, there is some fiddleness with distance. Characters in M&M can move hundreds of miles in a single turn. They can be 50 feet tall. They can snipe targets on the moon. Yet, for some reason there are still powers in this book that give exact distances. You cannot use maps for a system like this, beyond just general positioning. Yet, the rules occasionally care if two characters are standing 11 feet apart or 10. This is difficult when a fight takes place across a museum. This is impossible when a fight takes place across an entire city. I have no solution for this other than to just decide what feels right.

**Leveling Up:**

A word of warning about character advancement. Increasing power levels over time can make character concepts less defined. Players usually start with enough points to do their thing, which means more points just tends to encourage them to dilute their concept. Personally, looking back, I don't think this is a great system for a long form campaigns where characters are expected to get stronger over time. Characters often feel less interesting as they get more points, not more.

**Final Thoughts:**

To summarize everything: what is Mutants and Masterminds good for? Absolutely some things. If you want street level heroes who struggle against normal mooks, I would leave it on the shelf. If you want a more traditional dungeon crawler, but with superhero theming, leave it on the shelf. If you want tight, tactical battles leave this book on the shelf.

However, if you want a wide variety of wacky abilities in a high powered setting, are ok with a bit of GM fiat, and have players who will engage with the rules without trying to break them, this system can really sing.

1ca00kj,I'm an experienced GM with an experienced group of players and I ran Daggerheart. Here are my thoughts.,"So some background on me and the group. There’s me who has been a forever GM for close to 25 years. My group (Bard, Guardian, Seraph, and Sorcerer) and I are quite experienced both individually and together. Two things to note is that Bard and Guardian are far more active roleplayers than Seraph and Sorcerer who tend to be focused more on combat and mechanics but we all mesh well. We’ve been doing Cyberpunk: Red for a while and since we just finished an arc we decided to take a break for a one shot and possibly a short campaign with Daggerheart.

**EDITED TO ADD**: Daggerheart is a RPG in open beta by Darrington Press and designed by many of the Critical Role folk. The primary mechanic is rolling 2d12 with one d12 being ""Hope"" the other being ""Fear."" Rolling a higher Fear than Hope (regardless if it's a success or not) means ""rolling with Fear"" which either throws in a complication then and there or gives the DM a ""Fear"" token which they can use to trigger a complication later. Rolling a higher Hope (regardless if it's a failure or not) means ""rolling with Hope"" and gives the player a Hope token they can use for certain class abilities or other things like helping an ally or to use your ""experience"" (a sort of catchall for skills, feats and so forth) when it is narratively relevant.

For the one shot I used a heavily modified version of the Quickstart Adventure with minis but used as just a rough estimation of where everybody was in relation to one another. There’s a lot more combat and a more ‘on-rails’ plot than I normally run but no more than my usual one-shot where time is essential.

# Good

* Everyone liked the Hope/Fear mechanic itself on paper. The possibility of complications is something we liked from Forged In The Dark games and succeeding with Fear was a big hit.
* Although it took up a lot of room, they enjoyed the cards on abilities for ease of reference.
* The combat mechanics went over well especially with the threshold and armor system preventing combat from getting too swingy.
* Once we got in the groove of the action tracker it seemed to run far more smooth than other variants of initiative we’ve tried. Since I absolutely DESPISE the default initiative system that D&D and Pathfinder have I’m always looking for better ideas so this was a huge win for me as well although I do have a caveat (more on that later).
* Everyone seemed to like the heritage/ancestry/subclass system and had a lot of fun roleplaying their heritage (although Seraph used the Firbolg ancestry she changed the skin of it to a polar bear). Having heritage/ancestry/subclass abilities that actually matter was also popular with Bard making a lot of jokes about his Faun kicking the skull off a skeleton.
* Fear was a good mechanic to keep the narrative interesting but without it feeling like purely DM fiat.
* Loved the way adversaries are presented and organized (with roles and tiers). Considering the thing I like the least about 5e is how awful it is with giving DMs the tools to create a balanced encounters, this was a blessing. While it’s not as mathematically precise as Pathfinder, I like this system a bit more as it’s a little easier to put together. The spread of creatures was also nice.
* Sorcerer reported loving playing a melee orc magic user with armor and slinging spells even if the spell list was quite limited. Part of this was with my lore pushing orcs to act like Klingons from Star Trek or Clanners from Battletech but overall it was a cool change from D&D.
* Speaking of which, the positives are how Daggerheart diverged from 5e with classes like Guardian and Seraph. I wish they had gone all the way.

# Bad

* The biggest problem (which many of the others will be branched from) is the lack of a unifying mechanic. You have hit points, armor points, stress points, Hope tokens, and even abilities with THEIR OWN tokens. It felt ‘busy’ according to one player and everyone agreed.
* That being said, my players had a TON of Hope tokens by the end of the battle with very little to spend them on. Maybe they rolled really well or we missed something or we picked abilities and subclasses that didn’t use them very much but having so many didn’t seem like a good thing.
* There was some confusion if an Experience can be spammed for an entire battle if the objective fits. For example Guardian had “Bodyguard” and Seraph had “Holy Warrior”. Since they were protecting a wizard from evil necromancers and animated skeletons I let both players used their Experience during combat although they had to keep using Hope tokens (although as noted having enough Hope wasn’t really an issue). Not sure if this was intended but maybe some clarification could work.
* Combat was rather easy though part of this may have been short rests being too good (more on that in a bit). If I were running it again for four players, I would definitely amp up the difficulty.
* The Action Tracker worked great for our group. However, even we saw the potential for this to be a problem for others. This system is definitely not for people who aren’t interested in collaborative storytelling or want something closer to a board or war game during combat. That will be a considerable amount of 5e players I imagine.
* The players did like the cards but found the ‘cheat sheet’ that pointed to different parts of the character sheet were worthless especially with the table already crowded.
* While I’m a fan of combat with broadly defined ranges it still was hard to run theater of the mind. Halfway through we decided life was easier with figures although we used it more as a way to represent distances more than granular movement in 5e or Pathfinder.
* Short Rests felt too good. Even with three short rests before a long rest felt too powerful especially. As mentioned with players having too much Hope this is compounded with Short Rests allowing multiple players getting 2 Hope. There definitely needs to be more adjustments made here. This may be balanced with stronger adversaries.
* The flip side of Seraph and Guardian were the copies of other classes from 5e. I was hoping there would be more innovation than just two classes and importing the rest straight from 5e. Looking for this to be improved at least a little bit.

# Ugly

So this being a module with my changes it could be a bit unbalanced but considering the only change I made was ADDING a combat and my players finished the adventure with only moderate damage and a short rest to spare I think the adventure is too easy. I’ll be experimenting with adventures made from scratch using their recommendations. While the Action Tracker can be an issue with some groups, the biggest problem is the lack of things to use for Hope. Again this was an on rails adventure with a focus on combat but I don’t think that fully explains the problem.

That being said, my group and I really enjoyed Daggerheart and have expressed interest in doing a short campaign at minimum. We’re also considering experimenting with some things: particularly using Hope in exchange for losing a Stress, reducing the Stress limit or eliminating it altogether since I felt this was the most extraneous stat. That could mean we go from Hope surpluses to Hope droughts but that's why we experiment.

I would say a game like Daggerheart coming from CR is going to have the ""Too crazy for Boy's Town. Too much of a boy for Crazy Town"" problem. 5e enthusiasts will dislike all the things that make it different than 5e while someone like me will dislike all the things that are too similar to 5e. Still the core of Daggerheart being narrative, collaborative, and rulings over rules doesn't look to be going anywhere, so I can't complain too much.

Well that’s my $0.02 and I'll be giving more as I run more sessions of Daggerheart.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c38aae70>,rpg,1713754193.0
1eh5rug,Are TTRPG's Books Just Game Master P*rn?,"In the wake of books like MORK BORG and Vermis, I have started to wonder if the TTRPG industry is mostly supported by the **idea/ potential** of taking part in TTRPG's, rather than reality of actually **playing** them. It seems that establishing impressive visuals and tone with little, or even completely without, rules can perform better financially than the majority of other well-crafted TTRPG's.

And I am not sure if this is a bad thing either. Just that it is something that may be interesting to take notice of. Personally, I find that my desktop folders and bookshelves are full of games that I have never even attempted to play, but that I do sincerely enjoy reading through, looking at the pretty pictures, and dreaming of the day that I might sit down and play them with a group of friends. Maybe I am in the minority on this, but I feel like there are probably folks out there that can relate.

TTRPG nights are hard to schedule and execute when everyone has such busy lives, but if we had all the time in the world, would we actually finally pull out all of these tucked away games and play them?

**EDIT:** *It would probably be good to mention that the games that* ***I ACTUALLY PLAY*** *are games like Mausritter. Games with fleshed out GM toolboxes, random tables, and clear/ concise rules. They get you to the table through there intuitive design. The contrast I'm pointing out is that this is not true of some of the best performing RPG related books, and I find that interesting. Not good. Not bad. Just interesting.*

**EDIT EDIT:** Yes, I know... Vermis is not a TTRPG book. *The reason I mentioned it is because it was reviewed by Questing Beast on YouTube, and it is one of the best performing videos on his channel. A channel dedicated to OSR TTRPG’s. Again, I have no problem with that, but I think it’s really intriguing! IN A GOOD WAY!

1dixe8p,Evil Genius Games is back on their crypto nonsense,"Quick note - this is about Evil **Genius** Games, best known for Everyday Heroes, Netflix lawsuits, crypto controversies, and mass resignations. This is not about Evil **Hat** Games, best known for Fate Core and related games. There's no relationship that I know of.

It looks like, once again, Evil Genius Games has dedicated itself to all the crypto shit they promised, just earlier this year, that they'd never touch. They presented at a cryptocurrency convention last month, per this reporting by ENworld. 

Some choice quotes - 

""Imagine a scenario where you could actually buy NFT utilities that are exclusive to these licenses you could actually pilot Gypsy Danger, you can carry Rambo's M60, all of these that have value that can be bought sold and traded but more importantly in the Roblox fashion we're going to allow other people to actually create their own NFTs which can be thrown onto a marketplace where they can buy, sell and trade those adventures as well.""
... 
""All the Creator Marketplace components of it, the UGC components of it, the entire utility is on chain. If you've actually played RPGs before there's a character sheet, all the components of the character sheet will have objects on it, all the objects will be NFTs. In addition to that the actual character sheet itself will be minted as an NFT as well so what that means is that if we use your character as an NPC in a future game we'll actually pay you royalties on the character itself. So the whole thing is based off of objects which are have NFT components to it.""

In other words - a complete and total misunderstanding of why (and how) people play RPGs, complete with regular crypto transactions. Yay. 

They also claim Jeff Grubb is on their staff. Jeff Grubb has disagreed with this in the past.

Some really good reporting, here - both in this article and their previous ones on Evil Genius.

1hsr633,Here's 24 tiny reviews of the 24 TTRPGs I played in 2024.,"I love TTRPGs the same way most people love charcuterie boards: meals are nice, but I love tasty little snacks even more.

For that reason, I play a lot of different games! In the spirit of the year end, here's 24 tiny reviews of the games I played this year. I'll start with all the one shots, then go into talking about campaigns.

# One Shots

**Exquisite Biome,** *Caro Asercion* (2022)

From the creator of *i'm sorry did you say street magic*, the ecology builder *Exquisite Biome* is a weird and wonderful look into an imagined natural world. I loved that it felt like a sandbox toy as much as a game -- you could use this to tell the story of an ecosystem, or to set up a world to play in later. Super original idea, only needs a deck of cards and the prompt lists.

Would love to try this one again and see just how different the ecosystem ends up.

**Plasmodics,** *Will Jobst* (2025)

A playtest! Was lucky enough to take this freaky, funky game for a spin at Breakout Con in March. The game sews together a couple tried-and-true dice mechanics with an evocative and bizarre setting that isn't shy about getting sci-fi in a weird way. Stylish and competent, I enjoyed my time with *Plasmodics* in spite of it falling outside my usual wheelhouse.

**Galactic,** *Riley Rethal* (2020)

What if a *Star Wars* RPG had the soul of the series instead of the IP rights? Rethal's 2020 *Galactic* is a diceless, GMless take on the twists and tropes of the sci-fi classic. This game is a masterclass in finding what actually matters and giving players the tools to run after it. I can totally imagine playing a full campaign of *Galactic,* but the two one-shots I ran both managed to tell robust, exciting stories within a few hours.

**Halo 'N' Horns,** *Connie Chang* (2021)

Two GMs act as angel and devil on the shoulders of a player character. This game was designed with streaming in mind, and as one third of a TTRPG stream team, I knew this had to happen.

*Halo 'N' Horns* is pretty stripped down, but the central idea is strong enough that we never felt lost at sea. I liked the push and pull, but I think this did benefit a lot from the live audience.

**Troika!,** *Daniel Sell* (2019)

*Troika!* manages to take familiar fantasy ideas and turn them completely on their heads. It feels vibrant, but with a restrained dry humour that never looks right at the camera. We played through the in-book adventure *The Blancmage & Thistle*, and I was surprised at how much player choice it felt like there was in a pretty linear adventure (literally an elevator ride). I can also totally see how it would springboard a whole adventure from there.

This was one of the games I was most nervous about running this year, but also one of my favourite experiences in retrospect. A lot of that has to do with the quality of Troika's writing, which is a real treat. The rest has to do with the smiles on my players' faces every time I said another batshit insane thing they walked into.

**A Lesser Well of Dreams,** *Jackson Tegu* (2017)

This might be my one-shot pick of the year. A true slice-of-life game, Tegu's 2017 *A Lesser Well of Dreams* is set at a drizzly cottage in the Pacific northwest with a magic well in the yard. The game is grounded in the mundanity of a small shared weekend with friends, complete with dishes and board games. The ritual of flipping coins into the well each scene keeps things engaging, and I love the punctuation of dream sequences to get a look inside character psyches.

I loved this game, and I know I'll play it again when the right mood strikes. 

**Precious Things,** *Lucas Zellers & Emily Entner* (2024)

Little dragons try to make a little dragon hoard. I played the first edition of *Precious Things,* which is very *Lasers & Feelings* (Harper, 2013). Our game was silly and cute, which was exactly what I expected. My big takeaway is that the player choice of what they're trying to hoard is the single biggest impact on your play experience. One of my players chose keys. The other chose Grogu merchandise, which, god, is the most *her* thing she could have done.

I'm curious to see what Zellers and Entner do with their second edition, which sounds like it'll be a major build-out.

**Broken Cities,** *Côme Martin* (2023)

*Broken Cities* is the most recent in a growing list of creative games from experimental French designer Côme Martin. Players explore a surreal, twisting cityscape, full of art deco accents and early 20th century technological strangeness. Our story was the direct product of Martin's clever prompt-writing, but felt wholly our own and packed a punch at the end.

To get personal for a second... I first heard about Martin's work as points of comparison to my own games, since we both designed slice-of-life coming-of-age stories with timeskips. Since then, I've kept my eyes open for opportunities to table Martin's output, and I'm not disappointed. 

**Star Crossed,** *Alex Roberts* (2019)

The freshman offering from genius designer Alex Roberts, *Star Crossed* took ""*Dread* but make it romance"" and built it up to something more than the sum of its parts. Fresh, modern, and genuinely sexy, *Star Crossed* is a game that never fails to surprise me with the rush of delightful tension it brings.

This was my sixth or seventh play of *Star Crossed*, but every time feels like butterflies.

**Cowboys with Big Hearts,** *Jason Morningstar* (2021)

Jason Morningstar is not just the designer of *Fiasco*; he's also one of the most prolific, consistent game designers in the contemporary scene. Morningstar's bread and butter is combining historical oddities with light RPG mechanics that can get almost anyone from zero to larping in minutes.

*Cowboys with Big Hearts* is a favourite of mine from Morningstar's excellent ludography, and this was my fifth or sixth playthrough of it. You're a bunch of cowpokes on their way to stop the dastardly Death Brothers... but you also have terminal heart conditions. Funnier and more tragic than you imagine, *Cowboys with Big Hearts* is an instant classic from one of the best designers working today.

**Our Haunt,** *Rae Nedjadi* (2019)

*Our Haunt* is a diceless, GMless game exploring a haunted house from the perspective of those who haunt it. I loved the prompts and playbooks, but our session mostly made me want to try this in a campaign format -- there were story elements that felt like they wanted longer to simmer than a one shot was able to give. Still, our story managed to make us all feel a little spooked and a little heartbroken, which is a perfect combo for a horror game.

**HOUNDs,** *Tyler Crumrine* (2021)

*HOUNDs* is a game about a pilot and their sentient mech, as they desperately strive to escape those who would wipe the mech's memories. We loved the central hook, and leveraged it into a story about a dance mech somehow felt completely serious and very human.

**Death of the Author,** *Sam Leigh* (2024)

*Death of the Author* is a game mostly intended for solo play: a struggle between a character and their creator. We played it as a duet game, talking through prompts and imagining a story together. I liked the little tools that Leigh gave players to circumvent expectations and influence the story -- when your powers let you subvert a scripted prompt, it feels like you're rebelling against fate.

**Goblin Market,** *Eliot Crow* (2022)

Crow's *Goblin Market* is a GMless storygame that follows the creation and exploration of a fairy night market. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the story prompts neatly snowballed into a story with gravity and intrigue, and I was thinking about this game for a couple months afterwards.

**Threadbare,** *Stephanie Bryant* (2017)

*Threadbare* is a Powered by the Apocalypse Game about broken toys. The lost toys theme is incredibly well integrated into the playbooks and worldbuilding, and the game has some very clever repair and crafting ideas that help the scrappy ethos come alive. I don't generally love PbtAs, but Bryant's work is well-realized and does exactly what it sets out to do.

**Heroic Verse,** *Kay Marlow Allen* (2024)

The only solo game I actually played solo, Allen's *Heroic Verse* is a poetry generating game with a Legend of Zelda theme. This was one of the submissions to the *Majora's Mask* game jam held in April, and I loved it enough to make a game of my own using its engine.

The full build came out a few days after I playtested it, and I really like how many different play modes there are for different creative energies! Thoughtfully themed and really quite fun. 

**Determina,** *Paki Spivey* (2024)

Another submission to the *Majora's Mask* game jam, Spivey's *Determina* is a very clever riff on hope in a doomed world. I love that this game is played without a hero: everyone is on equal footing, trying to muddle through an impossible situation. I had the good fortune to playtest this with the designer, so I can't speak to the game text, but I think it's telling how similar Spivey's submission was to mine mechanically. I love card prompts, and I love Zelda, and I loved my time with this game. 

**Eyeless Smile,** *Jackson Tegu* (2018)

Recognizing just how many games in this list I've described as ""weird,"" this game is WEIRD. Tegu's 2018 surrealist romp asks ""what if body horror, but happy instead of sad?"" It really shouldn't work, but it actually does. *Eyeless Smile* is a story about mutants in a bizarre world, and it uses a novel verse-chorus structure that reminds me a little of *Firebrands*.

**Gun & Slinger,** *Nevyn Holmes* (2021)

A three player exclusive, which means this game was designed specifically for me. *Gun & Slinger* combines weird western worldbuilding (say that three times fast) with Go Fish.

I think this is the second game here that gets the ""best as a campaign"" asterisk, because there was so much world to explore and we just saw a glimpse of it. Still, the back-and-forth was really exciting, and our doomed duo ended up as the centerpiece in a story of death and rebirth that bucked the expectations of a traditional western in just the right ways.

**Colostle,** *Nich Angell* (2022)

One more solo game played unsolo, just to round out the list. *Colostle* is by one of those maddeningly talented people who can write and illustrate it all themselves.

The world of *Colostle* \-- a giant castle so large it could be a planet -- is evocative and playful, with splashes of quirky colour throughout. I'll abstain from a full review, since we strayed pretty far from the imagined play mode, but there's a lot of material here for adventure.

# Campaigns

**Wanderhome,** *Jay Dragon* (2021)

*Wanderhome* is my favourite game, and this was the fourth campaign I've played with it since its release. A gorgeous, soft world, with brilliant prompts and the most evocative playbooks ever written. It may not be for the die-hard structure fans, but *Wanderhome*'s gentle touch is exactly what makes it so special to me. 

**Yazeba's Bed & Breakfast,** *Possum Creek Games* (2024)

The long-awaited *Yazeba's Bed & Breakfast* (*Zeeb's*) is kind of a monster. A massive, 500 page tome, *Zeeb's* is a work of madness: pages and pages of episodic story hooks, imaginative characters, and a ton of content you need to play to unlock. If *Pandemic Legacy* is a board game that rewards investment, *Yazeba's Bed & Breakfast* is the equivalent for the RPG world.

I've thoroughly enjoyed getting to know and love the baked-in cast of characters, and I really feel like I could keep playing this for years before the campaign ends. That never happens, making it high praise.

**Blades in the Dark,** *John Harper* (2017)

Harper's *Blades in the Dark* is the game I want to love but maybe don't. The playbooks are genius, the worldbuilding is brilliant, the action resolution system is fine clockwork... but the actual process of running and playing the game sometimes leaves me feeling a little restless. To its credit, this is almost certainly a me problem: far and away the most traditional RPG I play, *Blades* has a mechanical complexity that shifts the focus away from pure narrative towards more grounded situational play. I have a huge amount of respect for the game, but this might be the last campaign I run with it.

**Fall of Magic,** *Ross Cowman* (2015)

A short, three session campaign in the dazzling *Fall of Magic*. I played with a couple friends in real life, using the beautiful scroll that *Fall of Magic* is embedded into. I love the simple, scene-driven gameplay that Cowman coaxes out of a few words and images. One of my friends loved this campaign so much that he bought the game and ran his own; the other was a little lost with so much open space to play. Me? I'm looking forward to playing its successor, *City of Winter*, in 2025.

1glekpl,Playing in person is just better.,"Caveat: I play online a lot. I have long term gaming friends spread across the country. I am very grateful that there are tools we can use to play together despite that distance.

  
With that said: I just returned from Carnage Con in Killington VT where I ran 4 sessions (one The One Ring 2E Moria adventure; 3 sessions of a Shadowdark mini con-campaign) and I am reminded just how much better it is to play in person. Worlds better. Impossibly better.

RPGs are inherently a conversation, and all conversations (from a chat with your BFF to a meeting with HR to an academic intellectual debate) are better in person where you can read body language, respond to non-verbal cues and otherwise engage the complete conversation rather than a partial limited form of the conversation.

If you, like me, are mostly stuck playing online because of scheduling and/or distance, i am not trying to convince you to not do that. Those games are good and valuable. but I am suggesting you seek out opportunities to play TTRPGs in person if you have not in a while.

It's so good.

Caveat 2: I realize that there are some people who have a very difficult time with in person interactions and I am not discounting your needs or preferences. If you have anxiety or another situation that makes in person gaming impossible, you deserve good gaming too and I wish you the best.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c3a170e0>,rpg,1730941773.0

1d05oq4,Dad dream achieved: 5yo daughter played a RPG with me,"A primary school friend of hers drew her a map of a cave complex with lizards, dragons and snakes in it, which gave me the idea. She used d8s because they ""looked like diamonds"".

Her character ""Cara"" had three points in magic, which she flavoured as flames shooting out of her hands. She later went on to get a magic blue princess dress that improved her ability to hide.

She doesn't deal well with failure, and it was an opportunity to teach her resilience, as her character got hurt by an ice snake.

She found a healing potion which tasted like the soup daddy cooks for dinner, and re-warmed her body.

We worked in handwriting, reading, math (adding up three numbers 8 or less, comparing “is 11 bigger than 9?”), storytelling and verbal skills, she had to use her imagination to describe what her character did at different points.

Her goal? To go to her secret hideaway place where Cara could cuddle with her mummy and daddy.

But when I open any of the posts from the last year about “which system should I switch to from dnd?” And every comment on that post is just people hitting random letters on their keyboard it is so hard to gather any info from that. If I’ve never heard of that system how would I know the acronym?

1h1eu8s,Rant: I hate being the most passionate one in the group.,"We've all felt it. We're super passionate about yhe game we're in or just RPGs in general. We inherently want to get better at our job (either gm or player) to give everyone and yourself a better experience but the table is not as passionate. Obviously the answer is to talk to your players and sort out mismatched expectations in Session 0 and I've done that, but it doesn't change the gnawing small resentment for others not giving it like 10 or 15% more effort.

I've been learning more and more that I might have ADHD, all my friends are saying ""duh, you didn't notice?"" but I was tested when I was 8 and told I was just hyperactive so I accepted that. I'm now almost 27 and trying to deal with a much more difficult situation as I figure this all out. One of the illuminating things is the level to which I hyperfixate. I've always been super passionate about one thing then I'll hop to a new thing and be super passionate about that. For a bit in highschool it was Metal Gear Solid or FFXIV, or some new anime, or drawing. The obvious most recent one is RPGs. I am so fucking passionate about RPGs. I read rules for games I'll never play to get ideas for how I can do new things or make the games better for my players, I read blogs and listen to podcasts about theory, I am the sole person buying the books for my groups, hell I made a blog so I'd stop blasting one of my friends with inane rpg thoughts over discord.

And my players just can't match my freak, it's literally impossible and so I resent them a tiny bit but more so I resent the situation. I wish I was less passionate cause thats something I could theoretically control, I can't control how excited my players are outside of just doing a good job and making a game that responds to them.

I know the solution is finding players outside of my friends who can be this excited about stuff but 50% of RPGs for me are spending time with my friends and showing them stuff that makes me so fucking excited and hoping I can share that excitement with them.

I just needed to rant, I've been feeling stupid about how much I care about this stuff in proportion to the people I game with.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c3ea6990>,rpg,1732741282.0

1ena0w7,The Cosmere TTRPG is a DnD/PF hack with quirks and I am... sad?,"So I was about to back the Kickstarter and bankrupt my self for a few months, but I decided to read the Beta before. I saw the videos and really liked the Paths and Goals idea, it sounded like a good implementation for the Cosmere as Setting.

But then I started reading: 

• D20? Sure, it's a fun dice anyway. 

• Testing skills? Yeah, that's good too. 

• Six attributes? Ok...? 

• Ranks in skills that are by default associated with an attribute? Not my favorite thing, but sure. 

• Advantage, disadvantage, three actions, short rest and long rest? Wait. Wait... Is this DnD? 

• Imperial System for carrying capacity? Really?

I don't know why I was expecting something else, I was kind of hoping for a new kind of design that was unique to the Cosmere. I was looking forward to reading new takes on rules.

I mean, nothing against DnD, because it seems that the system works for the heroic high magic fantasy that the Cosmere is and what modern DnD is supposed to do well, the Beta reads as a thought out system and it will be easier to convince the people who already play DND.

On the other hand, such a compelling IP wouldn't even need to present something revolutionary, because fans would buy anything Cosmere anyway. I mean, I'm complaining about the system, but I'm still debating myself because of how invested I am and how much I want Cosmere themed books, dice and all.

Anyway, end of rant. Did anyone here felt something similar when reading/looking at the system?

Edit: I didn't noticed the character information was on demiplane. I wasn't expecting for it to be elsewhere instead of the beta document. With that context and comments around here, I know I reacted strongly against it being a DnD-like game, especially when reading the skills and weapons. But I now understand that it is more an interesting synthesis of other rulesets",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c3f78320>,rpg,1723133516.0
1erbtmr,"How long does it take to publish your own RPG by yourself? 8 years, turns out! AMA!","Hi there. My name is Josh McCrowell, and for the last 8 years I wrote a game called *[His Majesty the Worm](http://hismajestytheworm.games/)*. It came out last month!

I'm holding a public AMA here to celebrate the release of the game and hold a retrospective about my experiences getting a book to print without traditional publishing or crowdfunding support.

### What's His Majesty the Worm?

*His Majesty the Worm* is a new-school game with old-school sensibilities: the classic megadungeon experience given fresh life through a focus on the mundanities and small moments of daily life inside the dungeon. Food, hunger, light, and inventory management are central to play and actually fun. Tarot cards are used to create an action-packed combat system that ensures that all players have interesting choices every minute of combat: no downtime! If you like things like Dungeon Meshi or Rat Queens, you might find something fun in this game.

You can learn more about the game, and find links to buy either the physical or digital editions, on our [website](http://hismajestytheworm.games/)! **Preview chapters** (over 100 pages of content) are hosted on our Itch page, which is also linked from the site. 

(When it launched, the physical edition sold out within 3 hours. ~~The books are now restocked at Exalted Funeral!~~ Whoops just sold out again. Sorry about that! You can sign up to be notified of the restocks on Exalted Funeral's website.)

### How did you publish it?

Essentially, I worked one day a week on Sundays. I wrote the outline of a game and playtested it with friends. 

I have a lot of skepticism around the way games are currently crowdfunded, and knew I wanted to avoid running my own Kickstarter campaign. Instead, I used **Itchfunding** to fund art, editing, graphic design, layout, copyediting, and other things I can't do by myself. 

I put sample chapters, with very rough layout and art, onto Itch. Mostly, these were put up as pay-what-you-will (PWYW). Every time I accumulated enough scratch to pay somebody (e.g., commission a single piece of art), I did so. 

Part of the above process was doing a lot of self-driven marketing. I can talk about that too.

When the book was basically done, I shopped around for someone to print it for me. Eventually, Exalted Funeral agreed to publish it for me and split the printing fees. Now it's out! Hooray!

---

So if you want to chat about the process of independently publishing your own game or learn more about the Worm, please ask me anything! 

~~I'll be answering questions from 12:00 pm EST to 5 pm EST.~~

**Update:** Thanks so much for your questions and support, y'all. I need to step away now. During this AMA, *His Majesty the Worm* sold out (again!). You can sign up for my newsletter to be notified of restocks at the website: http://hismajestytheworm.games/

I'll drop back by later on to see if there's any other questions I can help answer about the process.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c3fb6660>,rpg,1723565262.0

1ffhvu5,"CAIN (the newest game by Tom Bloom, one of the authors of Lancer) is some of the best, leanest design I’ve ever seen ","And it’s all because of 2 simple mechanics:

Before I go into those, a bit of preamble. CAIN uses a similar system to Blades in the Dark, what with rolling dice pools hoping for sufficient successes from that pool, and then the GM narrates the world’s response. Minimal dice rolling on the GM’s side. This is where the first of these brilliant mechanics come in.

Rather than the GM’s narration being Freeform and “as seems appropriate”, the GM rolls something nifty called the Risk Die if the action could be considered “risky” (say, smacking a monster with a sharp stick). The result on the risk die determines what responses the GM has access to, and they’re often altered given the scenario or monster the party is hunting. Aside from just being a bit more even regarding the mechanical load, and really helping avoid choice paralysis, it does a brilliant job getting you into the appropriate mindset. Cain is very horror-shonen (more chainsawman than jujutsu kaisen), and so the game centres on hunting monsters created from human trauma. The responses they have access to are coloured by that trauma, meaning mindset, when playing them, is vital. It’s nice to be just genuinely barred from running a vengeful rage-monster as being too deliberating. It also adds my favorite element to any game: degrees of success. Winning and still getting screwed over by the Risk Die is frequent, as is losing and being blessedly safe. 

Next is Category. Keeping with shonen tradition, Cain has a ranking system, and that is Category. Category determines the strength, reach, speed, etc, of your powers and you. It’s such a simple leveling system that allows for meaningful growth in capability while sidestepping any need for getting bogged down in calculation. There’s also always a simple cool factor in dropping someone of a higher Category into the world and pointing to them to say “hey, you’re gonna be able to do that eventually”.

The rest of the game is nothing exceptionally different from Blades, if it weren’t for some innovations present I’d call it just a very good FitD hack. But they’re great rules, it’s a great book, and I’m having a blast running it.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c485c650>,rpg,1726187693.0
1cyiszs,Resentment of D&D grows ,"My LGS has a D&D one-shot every weekend and is open to having other ttrpgs ran if a GM wants to run them. This is my second time running “The Zone” and I’ve planned a two parter. The problem? Everyone who regularly plays Saturdays will only ever touch D&D. For example, my game on Saturday has had a thread for two weeks now and next to no interest outside of myself. Then you get other people posting about how they are thinking about buying a D&D supplement and running it and that one throw-away post gets more engagement. It's depressing because it makes 
me feel that there is no reason to bother running anything other than D&D because it's the only thing that will get attention. It's not just me either, but another GM tried running the ATLA ttrpg and only got three people counting himself, compared to the average D&D session that is capped and people are always asking to be slotted in",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c49a14f0>,rpg,1716433516.0
1f1o1xp,"It's not about the quantity of crunch, it's about the quality of crunch","I was playing the Battletech miniature wargame and had an epiphany: People talk about how many rules, but they don't talk that about *how good* those rules are.

If the rules are good, consistent, intuitive and fun... then the crunch isn't that hard. It becomes a net positive.

Consistent and intuitive rules are easier to learn. They complement each other, make sense and appeal to common sense. If a game has few, inconsistent and unintuitive rules, the learning process becomes harder. I saw campaigns die because the ""lite"" rules were meh. While the big 300 pages book kept several campaigns alive.

We have 4 decades debating and ruling what the OD&D thief can and can't do, but everyone understands what newer crunchier edition rogues can do. In fact, is easier to build a rogue that does what I want (even a rogue that transforms into a bear!).

Good and fun mechanics are easier to learn because it's motivating to play with them.

Mechanics are one of the things you actually *feel* as a person. We roll different dice, see different effects, use different procedures, it's visceral. So in my experience, they add to immersion. If each thing has it's own mechanics, it makes me feel different things in the story.

Do mech's in battletech have 3 modes of movement with different rules? Yes, but all the tactical decisions and trade offs that open up are fun. Speed *feels* different. Shooting moving targets, or while moving, is harder. The machine builds heat and can malfunction. Terrain and distance matters. It's a lethal dance on an alien planet.

Do I have to chose feats every time I level up in PF2e? Yes, but it's a tangible reward every level up. I get a new trick. I customize my class, my ancestry, my skills. Make my character concept matter. It allows me to express myself. Make my dwarf barbarian be *my* dwarf barbarian.

It's tactile, tangible at the table.

Good mechanics support the game and the narrative. They give us tools to make a kind of story happen. A game about XYZ has rules to make that experience. Transhuman horror in Eclipse Phase; space adventuring, exploration and trading in Traveller; detailed magic and modern horror in Mage: the Awakening; heroic fantasy combat and exploration in Pathfinder 2e; literal Star Trek episodes in Star Trek Adventures; a game with a JRPG style in Fabula Ultima; silly shenanigans in Paranoia.

Mechanics are a way to interface with the story, to create different narratives. My barbarian frightens with a deathly glare, their buddy cleric frightens by calling their mighty god and the monster frightens them with sheer cosmic horror. Each works in a different way, has different chances of working. And the frightened condition matters, my character is affected, and so am I.

(This is a more subjective point, because every table will need different supports for their particular game and story. The creator of Traveller saw actual combat, so he didn't need complicated combat rules. He knew how shoot outs went. While I, luckily, never saw combat and like to have rules that tell me how a gunshot affects my PC)

Making rulings for each new situation that comes up is still work (and ""rulings not rules"" can be an excuse to deliver an unhelpful product). In crunchy games:

A) The ruling work is already done, I have *helpful tools* at mu disposal

B) I probably won't need to look for it again

C) I have a solid precedent for rulings, some professional nerds made good rulings for me and codified them

In my experience, it saves me time and energy because the game jumps to help me. The goblin barbarian attempts to climb up the dragon. Well, there are athletic and acrobatic rolls, climbing rules, grappling rules, a three action economy, the ""lethal"" trait, off-guard condition, winging it with a +4 to attack... it's all there to use, I don't have to invent it in the spot because I have precedents that inspire my ruling.

In conclusion: crunch isn't bad if the crunch is good. And IMO, good crunchy is better than mediocre rules light.

inb4: keep in mind that I'm always talking about *good* extra rules, not just extra rules",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c4a37f80>,rpg,1724678456.0

Do I understand why no sane game designer would ever do such a thing? Yes to all those. BUT STILL I think it would have been so cool to have these two separate magical traditions existing side-by-side but completely distinct from one another.

For me personally it would have to be Call of Cthulhu, you roll up 8 different stats and none of them do anything, then you need to pick an occupation before divvying out a huge number of skill points among the 100 different skills with little help in terms of which skills are actually useful. Not to mention how many of these skills seem almost identical what's the point of Botany, Natural World and Biology all being separate skills, if I want to make a social character do I need Fast Talk, Charm and Persuade or is just one enough?

1f0ujq6,The Cosmere RPG base system is everything I wanted from 5.5,"1. It has horizontal character progression: more choices instead of just raw power upgrades.
2. An easy narrative Goals and Rewards system.
3. It's skill-based and allows eclectic or specialized characters by default, including any combination of ""multi-classing"".
4. Makes Initiative a player choice that can be either tactical or narrative-based. (Inspired by Shadow of the Demon Lord)
5. Makes basic Reactions impactful, with plenty of choices and uses.
6. ""Focus"" as a limited resource gives you many options of maneuvers or bonus effects with a balanced cost.
7. They solved the oh-no-hit-so-I-do-nothing turn of dnd martials with ""Graze"" (I don't know if it's new, but it's the first time I see it), so hitting is not only luck-based (you normally succeed on your Strike), but resource-based (if you fail at the Strike, just pay 1 focus to deal your damage-die damage as if you hit, without any damage bonus). Missing and still dealing damage at a cost feels great.
8. An easy and immediate Opportunities and Consequences system that does it's job when needed, without complex gimmicks or hindering the base rolls.
9. It's familiar enough that it's easily picked up, and doesn't alienate players.
10. Only rolling once per test with whatever dice you have to roll (d20 + Damage Die + Plot Die if needed) really makes for fast combats.
11. The Injury system promotes players overcoming challenges and character-story progression, while not heavily penalizing combat or risking easy character death, even at level 1.
12. The Recovery Die keeps resources (health and focus) tight, but still rechargable once per scene.

I also find the respect they've shown to GMs really refreshing; especially the attention they've shown to the Adversaries, with special Traits and Abilities that fit their role and play great at the table (even little details, like the Warform War-pairs moving together with a Reaction is just *chef's kiss*, such an easy way to represent their relationship and coordination). You can easily recognize that some people that worked on Flee Mortals! are also working on this project.

I can see myself home-brewing traditional fantasy Paths just to use it outside the Cosmere, and as far as Roshar is concerned they're doing a great job at adapting the Surges for what we've seen.

What about games where you like the mechanics but the setting ruins it for you? This is a question of personal taste, so no shame if you simply don't like setting XYZ for whatever reason. Bonus points if you've found a way to adapt the rules to fit setting or lore details you like better.

For me it'd be Golarion and the Forgotten Realms. As settings they come off as very safe with only a few lore details here or there that happen to be interesting and thought provoking. When you get into the books that inspired original D&D (stuff by Michael Moorcock and Fritz Lieber) you find a lot of weird fantasy.

But now (possibly also because of the way Hasbro has been pushing Dnd) outside of channels that specifically talk about other games (first that comes to mind is [Seth](https://www.youtube.com/@SSkorkowsky/videos)) this almost never happens

It feels like the divide between ""people that only play 5e"" and ""People that play ttrpgs"" keeps getting wider, and despite the OGL stuff getting people intereasted in Pathfinder for a little bit most big dnd influencer and channels are now back to making videos only about 5e

surely no ttrpg system wherein you have the freedom to do essentially anything can ever account for every possibility ? surely it's a certitiude that every Game Master is at some point going to have to think on their feet and make judgement calls ? 

can anyone give a convincing comparison as to how other systems (preferably comparable systems to 5e in style and goal) are more GM-friendly than 5e ?

1f2mrbn,Mongoose Publishing Now Owns Traveller ,"Mongoose Publishing Now Owns Traveller 

Copied from my email:

[This particular announcement comes to you as a member of COTI.]
[By the way, the Emperor's Birthday is August 29, (or 241-2024 in the Imperial notation). ]

>
Some years ago, fellow game designer Greg Stafford died, and I was impressed that his company announced almost immediately that he had a succession plan in place, and that his legacy and his designs would live on.

His example was an inspiration to me, and I resolved to emulate him. It would be a terrible loss if Traveller were encumbered, or somehow restricted in its outreach to present and future fans.

With that in mind, I have worked to make Traveller an asset to science-fiction role-players... with our user-friendly Fair Use policies, with the Travellers’ Aid Society programs, with the Cepheus editions of Traveller, and with Mongoose as a primary publisher of their edition of Traveller.

Over the past several years, I have turned over more and more responsibilities to Mongoose, and I have collaborated actively with them as they work to realize the Traveller dream. Earlier this year I passed full ownership of Traveller to Mongoose in order to secure its future.

With that in mind, I point out that, following the example of Greg Stafford, I have a succession plan in place: day-to-day decisions about the Traveller game system are already being made by Mongoose Publishing (with my co-operation and approval), and if anything should happen to me, they would carry on with my full knowledge and blessing.

That doesn’t stop me from speaking my mind: expressing opinions about Traveller, writing stories and lore, and even revealing secrets about the universe.

But Traveller is in good hands, now, and far into the far future.

And I thank you for your (continuing) support for Traveller.

Marc

Now, I have no problem when an author chooses to do so, but it is thoroughly dishonest and misleading when they list themselves as the artist in the credits section when you can tell the images were done by a program. Hands do not look right, weapons are held the wrong way, the outfits worn by two different people merge together, and a host of other small details show the picture is not right.

1f45tsy,Anyone else hate the idea of builds having to come 'online'?,"In CRPGs & TTRPGs, I've grown to hate this idea of builds needing to come 'online' over the years. In games with Character Levels in particular there seems to be a wild variation in how you're able to build a character type or implement an idea of what a character can do or be, based purely on when the concept comes 'online'.

The 'build' in my mind and in this case is standing in the way of the character and story.

In 5e/BG3 for instance, The Assassin class fails to fulfil the role/fantasy of an Assassin in a particularly thematic, interesting or tactical way. The most common suggestion for getting around this is to multiclass it with a Ranger Gloomstalker, which has a bunch of nifty level 3 abilities that really compliment the Assassin's 'theme'.

This is fine in theory, except that to start to play the character you want to play, you need to reach *at least Level 6.* You have to have played the game for some indeterminate amount of time before you can play the *game or your character* the way you'd like to play it.

Now people might argue that this is done to control the power levels of characters... but *what* a character can do is half the fun of these games, and there's no reason a character shouldn't be given a useful, fun, diverse tool (in the form of an ability, spell, effect etc.) that they *can* use but require a lot of training to use *effectively* or even *well*.

A Fireball is learned and that's 8d6 of Fire damage in a radius, no prior training or use of a lesser version of the spell necessary, you just need to hit 'level 5' and suddenly you can do it. What if I want a fireball earlier? One that does 3d6 damage, but only has a small radius?

I don't know, I'm probably the only one but I'm growing to hate this system.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c5f78f20>,rpg,1724946607.0
1e03a02,People's favorite way of playing TTRPGs is in-person. The second most favorite way of playing TTRPGs is online without webcams. I find it surprising that the two most popular ways of playing are either as social as possible or as anonymous as possible.,"I did a poll here on the weekend, and as imperfect as it was, it got quite a few responses.

#1. 176 votes for playing in-person.

#2. 39 votes for playing online without webcams.

#3. 15 votes for playing online with webcams on.

I wasn't surprised that people chose playing IRL first. Hanging out with friends and rolling dice rules. But I was surprised that the second choice wasn't playing online with cams, since that seems closer to the experience of hanging around a table and playing TTRPGs than playing online without cams. 

I'm wondering about the popularity of the second option. Can anyone can enlighten me as to why they prefer to play without cams when online? ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c70174a0>,rpg,1720636537.0
1hp4ou6,Proof of Concept: A Fully Offline TTRPG in a Single HTML File with Search and Bookmark Features!,"Lately, I've been hearing more and more people advocating for using Markdown and other digital formats to publish TTRPGs instead of/or in addition to PDFs. One conversation that stuck with me was from the Sly Flourish podcast, where they discussed the simplicity and accessibility of these formats and how some designers have been embracing markdon.

This got me thinking about an idea I've been tinkering with for a year or two: combining the functionality HTML pages provide with strong graphic design principles to create a single-file TTRPG. No external assets, no JPGs, PNGs, JS, or CSS files. Everything self-contained. My first attempt was for a Fallout TTRPG I was designing just for fun. It mimicked the green-screen look of the in-game terminals, complete with flickering effects and all: [https://snipboard.io/pwgxvj.jpg](https://snipboard.io/pwgxvj.jpg)

* **This is my proof of concept:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0oO8k9QRww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0oO8k9QRww)
* **Screenshot of Read Aloud screen reader** (will upload a video if requested): [https://snipboard.io/eyiT3x.jpg](https://snipboard.io/eyiT3x.jpg)
* **Testing responsiveness**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS\_uXIl-rlE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS_uXIl-rlE)

**Features:**

* A dynamically generated menu bar and table of contents for each ""section"" of the book.
* A simple but functional search feature to help navigate the content.
* The ability to bookmark specific headers for easy reference later.

# Pros:

1. **Accessibility:** A single HTML file works on nearly any device with a web browser, no installation or specific software required.
2. **Offline Functionality:** Players and GMs can download the file and use it entirely offline.
3. **Interactive Features:** Search, bookmarks, and dynamic menus make navigating the content much easier than flipping through pages.
4. **Customizability:** It’s easy to include thematic fonts, colors, and styles without relying on external files.
5. **Portability:** One file is simple to share and store compared to folders with multiple assets.
6. **Cost-Effective:** No need to print or rely on expensive PDF formatting tools AND you can add your own content using just basic knowledge of html.
7. **Responsive Design:** Can be designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices seamlessly.

# Cons:

1. **Learning Curve:** Designing a functional and visually appealing HTML TTRPG requires some coding knowledge.
2. **Graphic Limitations:** Inline images and styles can bloat the file or limit its visual fidelity compared to professional PDFs or printed books.
3. **Compatibility Issues:** While most modern browsers handle single-file HTML well, older or less common ones might struggle.
4. **File Size:** Embedding all assets (images, fonts, etc.) directly into the HTML can result in a large file size.
5. **Perceived Simplicity:** Some might view it as 'less professional' compared to traditional publishing formats like printed books or polished PDFs.
6. **Limited Security:** HTML is inherently editable, which might make creators hesitant to distribute without risk of unauthorized modifications.

What do you think of this approach? Could this be a viable format for TTRPGs in the future, or are traditional methods still the way to go? I'd love to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or critiques!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c7048da0>,rpg,1735503291.0
1dkof6y,Looking for a new Heroic High Fantasy TTRPG for my group!,"Hey everyone! I really need some help finding a new system for my group. We recently finished a Pathfinder 2e campaign (that lasted a year and a half), which was our second one after running through a D&D 5e campaign (another 2 year long campaign).

D&D 5e is not an option since it was a nightmare to make it interesting past level 12 considering how crazy some spells were, not to mention that building encounters felt like a terrible chore. The whole rulings vs. rules also felt a bit like a copout thing to keep the book from supporting me as a GM. And I don't even want to get started on how confusing the wordings are, so much so that it need the Sage Advice and Crawford to chime in whenever the rules failed to be clear.

Pathfinder 2e was the polar opposite, there's a rule for everything, which is great, but also ... there's a rule for everything. It was very hard to adjudicate something in the spur of the moment because that would likely step on the toes of a specific feat somewhere. Player's never felt completely comfortable with their classes and all they could do, specially my casters who felt like they were always playing 5D chess, compared to everyone else. Another thing they did mention is that they never got to feel properly powerful even though I was very generous with Trivial encounters (exactly with that purpose in mind). They didn't love the fact that whenever combat started everyone needed to bring their A game, put in tons of effort and play off of each other to tiring extent in order to come out on top, or otherwise they would struggle.

So we set out to look for a different system, that can be a good middle ground. Here are some of the things we tried:

* **Dragonbane:** They loved the roll under mechanics, and the skill based progression (no levels). They didn't like how gritty it felt.
* **Savage Worlds:** It was pulpy, but oh boy none of us were a fan of the resolution mechanics. It wasn't very fast either, but again they loved the advancement system. It made them feel like they slowly progress toward their goals as an adventurer.
* **Legend in the Mist:** Using the Tinderbox, plus the Otherscape rules which I own, we played for half a dozen games. They loved the cinematic feel, but the looseness of the rules were a bit of a turn off. They like rules that are a tad meatier than what it has to offer (so it's likely that no PbtA will suffise since City of Mist, Otherscape and Legend in the Mist are on the far end of crunchiness for PbtAs).
* **Daggerheart:** The vibe is there! However, the resolution mechanic was a flop for the group, and the card gimmick was really annoying to navigate. It being level based also was not great. But we enjoyed the tools for exploration, the Experiences, the more cinematic flow of combat, etc.

Here are also some of the things we looked into:

* **Conan 2D20 & Cohors Cthulhu:** They love Achtung! Cthulhu. They love the flexibility of Truths, and how Momentum feels awesome, so I read through Conan and Cohors, and the tone is not quite there. A bit too gritty and the lack of fantasy ancestries is an issue.
* **BRP (Runequest & Mythras):** We haven't tested it yet, thought I have DMed Call of Cthulhu for years so I'm somewhat familiar with the D100 system. If it's anything like CoC I'm afraid it'll be too dangerous and punishing for them, but we'll try it even though the tone is way off for what we want (too bronze-age-y and retro-dnd for our liking).
* **Warhammer Fantasy:** Another D100 system that was suggested. It felt too gritty as well, but we're definitely giving it a shot too. (Nefver know until we try it).

Moreover, these are the things we are looking for in a game:

* Heroic High Fantasy tone; they want to fight dragons, brave jungles with crazy liches and weird ziggurats, uncover magical artefacts, shove their foot in the face of villains, without caring too much with the ""survival"" aspect of things, or how brutal they are (which likely excludes Forbidden Lands too).
* Challenges; Not wanting something brutal doesn't mean they want everything to be easy. They just don't want everything to be a fight for survival, like their lives are always on the line and any small mistake will cost them their character. (So probably OSR is not the right path).
* Simple and flexible resolution system; They loved rolling under mechanics, they also enjoy dice pools, but we are all tired of the D20+mod vs. DC variants out there. They love how Truths in the 2D20 system make the game feel flexible since they like to think out of the box for a lot of things.
* Magic; This is a big one. Something with a good balance between powerful and flexible but that doesn't outright negate everything or undermines martials. (Also why The One Ring didn't appeal to them, the lack of magic wielding options was a turn off)
* Setting agnostic; They enjoy playing in the Realms, Greyhawk, Eberron, Exandria, Golarion, and the likes. So having a system that can be lifted from its setting and placed in any of those would be great.

I know this is super freaking specific, and it is likely that there's no game out there that ticks all boxes, but in all honesty I don't know what I don't know, so before giving up and getting whatever's closer and adapting it I thought I'd turn to the community who might know of just the thing.

  
**TLDR;** Group with a very specific thing in mind, tried a lot of systems for heroic fantasy and still hasn't found the right game. If you could reccomend something you think would fit, and tell me why you'd think so it would be greatly appreciated!

**EDIT:** Thank you all for the help. I have read through the all Quickstarts, previews, and blog posts (and the actual book whenever it was something I had in my collection) that you all pointed me too, and I think I might have found just the game for my group: **Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Soulbound**.
The system is nearly everything I wanted. I mentioned it to two of my players and they’re actually super pumped after reading a bit about it.

1h2tn54,I didn't think that being an RPG designer would mean asking my parents to microwave a dandelion.,"I make games. Sometimes they're [dice-rolling fantasy things](https://a-smouldering-lighthouse.itch.io/faewater). Sometimes they're... stranger than that. 

Last month, I designed a game where [everyone makes dandelion crowns](https://a-smouldering-lighthouse.itch.io/dandelions) and mourns a lost friend named Jessie. The flower crowns are real; Jessie is not. The flowers you find and the process of weaving the crown shape your conversation about her, and the kind of person she was.

Because the game is a kind of eulogy, I wanted the design to be a collage. Memories of a person often feel like little cuttings from their life, reassembled into a story. I rummaged around the Internet finding public domain dandelion art, stock photos, paper textures. There was one thing I couldn't find online: a (free) photo of a pressed dandelion, meant to look like it was pressed between the pages. Once I latched onto that idea, I really wanted it! So I slipped on a backpack and went walking.

Unfortunately for my goofy ass, it was October in Canada, so I couldn't find a dandelion in bloom. I did manage to snag some that had gone to seed, which were useful on their own. But no luck on the little yellow pieces of sunshine.

The next day, I was talking to my parents over the phone, complaining about my dandelion woes. To my surprise, my mom said ""I think I saw one in our garden!"" and dashed outside. A minute later, she was back on the phone, triumphant. She found a dandelion!

But I needed a *pressed* dandelion... and since the game was going online soon, we were short on time for the slow process of preserving flowers. I was not without my tricks, though. Did you know that, in a pinch, you can microwave flowers to get a quick-dry that's almost as good as a few weeks between books?

I'm sure you can see where this goes. Which of the following steps do you think was hard to explain over the phone to two seventy year-olds?

1. Place the dandelion between two kitchen towels.
2. Place a flat piece of glassware (a food storage container, a glass pie plate) on top of the towels.
3. *Set the microwave to 50% power.*
4. Microwave for 2 minutes.

If I was a betting man, I'd guess you just said number 3. Here's how the conversation actually went:

1. Why a kitchen towel! Does it have to be a kitchen towel? We have paper towels. What do you mean ""between""? Face down or face up? We'll use the paper towels. Why a kitchen towel?
2. How do I put the glass on top? What do you mean ""glassware""? It's too heavy. It's too light! I don't know if we missed the dandelion. Does it just sit there?
3. We know how to set the microwave to 50% power! My goodness, who doesn't know how to do that? You don't need to explain everything.
4. TWO MINUTES! It's going to burn. We're going to burn the dandelion! Two minutes? Oh no. It needs to be less, I think. Oh dear.

Two minutes later, I had one picture of a pressed, yellow dandelion.

Two months later, I was very lucky to [receive an award](https://www.goldencobra.org/2024winners.html) from the judges of the Golden Cobra Challenge for *A Crown of Dandelions.*

I do feel a *little* imposter syndrome -- they couldn't exactly play it during judging, November in New Jersey -- but I am very grateful for the nod. And also to my parents, for finding a little yellow dandelion and trusting my microwave instructions.

1cx6vkn,You don't need to be a good GM. ,"Looking at some of the top posts this weeks, I was reminded of something that always bothers me. Just how many and how urgently people stress being a good gm. The imposter syndrome, the hours of books read and videos watched, getting genuinely offended when someone calls you a bad GM, some of it I feel too, but a lot of it doesn't really connect with me. I'm aware that the sentiment I'm about to express isn't exactly revolutionary either, apologies if this is a common post topic here, but you really don't need to be a good gm. 

There are plenty of hobbies, heck even this hobby if you're talking to a forever player, where skill takes a bit of a backseat. I get that there are differences, as a gm everyone's fun might depend on your performance, but the key word there is might. A lot of time you can more or less just coast and it'll still be a pretty fun session. Even if you mess up or make bad decisions, things will probably still turn out okay, if not exactly incredible. Another reason is how much effort, weeks of planning even, might go into a say two hour event. You want to do everything you can to make sure that isn't a waste, isn't a disappointment, and so you end up spending even more time trying to up your success rate only for player problems, scheduling/irl issues, or you just having a brain fart/not feeling it on the day to potentially ruin things anyway. I can understand the feelings that lead to the fixation, (pardon the overstatement but I'm a sucker for alliteration), but I do wish I knew how to convince people to take things a little less seriously sometimes.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, it's OK to relax and just let yourself be a bad, or at least mediocre gm every now and then. Heck, its fine to do that most of the time if you still enjoy running games that way. Are you having fun most of the time? Are your players having fun most of the time? Then why does it matter? If someone calls you a bad gm, after they're disappointed with a session you put a solid amount of effort in and any they put in was to the detriment of everyone else at the table, well... maybe they're right. But you don't need to be a good gm. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c72aac60>,rpg,1716295101.0

1fmb44v,The Players Paradox: Wanting to Play but Not Wanting to Learn,"So I was wondering if this topic had been addressed in specific terms. 
Essentially what the title says, players wanting to play a ttrpg but very unwilling to learn the rules beyond “roll dice to overcome check.” 
I call this the Players Paradox since this mindset contradicts itself to the very nature of the hobby to a decent degree. What I’ve encountered in my time as a DM is players who absolutely want to play a galavanting adventure or in-depth story with memorable characters and moments but find the rules that aid in this endeavor to stifle their pursuit of collective storytelling and emergent gameplay. 
Often times, it would be things like not remembering how spells work or forgetting an integral character’s ability that they chose. 
To further complicate this, I’ve tried using different systems that would appeal to their needs but would encounter the same issues as well a new concern that the game was not as engaging or “simple” for them. It became a situation where they disliked the current rules and wanted them changed to where they didn’t need to remember anything beyond a modifier but didn’t want anything new nor wanted to feel the same as other characters. 

In addition, I’ve personally experienced a strange issue that is counter to what most D&D videos and posts pose where I have had many players who want to be railroaded with curated experiences and abhor anything that isn’t just constant success. I count this as part of the players paradox as they want stakes and drama but without any chance of failure or at least failure that is to the immediate detriment of their character. 

I’ve asked some players about this and they have said that they’re coming to the game to have a story be told while playing “D&D.” They have said they want a Skyrim/Dragon Age/The Witcher/Baldur’s Gatr-vibe where they’re seeking content out to riff and have fun with each other. 

To grant context, I’ve played 5e, Index Card RPG, Dragonbane, and various story games with these groups. I have also expressed my side of this to my players stating that I can’t help provide decent scenarios without them knowing what their characters can do. Some players took this well while others vehemently got repulsed by the concept of learning their character and fully abandoned that character or group simply because they were asked to not shift the responsibility onto the DM. On the players that stayed but were repulsed by this idea, they expressed that they didn’t want to get anything wrong and thought that dropping their current character for a simpler one was better. I did reach out to a player who dropped and they did say that learning any rules at all that weren’t immediately understood or on the page was not fun for them and while they liked playing with others, learning enough to understand their character was not worth it. 

I have DM’d for 12 years now and this has been very consistent among my players, even in games where rules were lite or failure was used as “success at cost.”

So I pose this post to ask the wider /rpg community if you’ve also dealt with this concern amongst your player base and how you addressed it?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c73565a0>,rpg,1726947706.0

I know that PDFs are way more accessible with the advent of places like DriveThruRPG, but for the life of me, I just cannot read PDFs for rulebooks when compared to a physical book.

I don't know what it is, maybe it's OCD or like a focus thing, but there is a world of difference when I'm reading a book on a screen as opposed to reading it in print.  With PDFs, I just really can't focus of stay interested, something tangible is missing. 

The problem is that this had led to situations where I feel like I can't fully enjoy or play games like Rogue Trader or other older games because I need a print copy of the book, and of course lots of out of print stuff is expensive.  So in order to try these games, I feel I have to track down and buy these pricey books in order to physically have them.

1g9p01s,DMing for players that have DMing experience feels so much better,"I have been DMing since last year after being a player for 2 years. I first DM'd a few one-shots for a group of friends and colleagues that I had been a player as a trial. Since we knew each other, the group dynamics was amazing. They loved the plots and combats and it gave me so much confidence to keep it up.

Then I moved to another city so I had to depart with the friend group. I craved for more DMing so I thought ""hmm I think I am truly in love with DnD now, might as well get more players into it"".

I then went on looking for group discords and DM'd a few offline one shots for the strangers. For the ""promotional"" purpose, I prioritized new players that are interested in getting into the game.

Although they seemed nice and motivated in the messages, I found that many of them had a hard time to ""respect"" the whole thing after playing with them. No, I don't mind if they do anything funny in game or lose interest if I don't do well. Hell, I was a new player once, I knew what it was like. But they either didn't even care to read, or invest they time and energy in either playing or remembering the plots to make things better for everyone. They didn't even want to help me carrying the stuff or move the tables to set up. It felt like I was providing service for them for free. It was mentally exhausting and I almost lost the interest in DnD completely.

I vented that to that DM from that group of friends and colleagues. He told me I should get a group with DMs and experience players this time instead, coz they know things better.

Now I have been DMing for almost six months for this group of 5, 4 of them are DMs for other groups, the another one is a long term players since a kid. The difference is crazy. I got compliments and feedbacks after every session. We quickly form unspoken rules and know what each others is doing to push the game forward. They always come early to help me setting up and cooking. And we get to even talk about things other than DnD. Memes and inside jokes on discord nonstop. It's really refreshing that after a long time I finally felt ""DM are players too"" again. I feel not only respected but loved coz I think there are things that only DMs understand.

Sorry if it sounds a bit gatekeeping to newer players. It's more of a share of experience if someone feels frustrated with DMing. It's also something newer players could help the DM (and yourself) to have more fun. If you are a DM and feel the same way I felt before, if you can change how the players behave then sure, if you can't then maybe a different audience is what you need. If you are a newer player, please take care of your DM and try to be a good player as well.

1cedujd,My favorite underrated Mechanic: Tables that are larger than the dice you roll against them.,"Imagine you have a list of treasures... you start with copper and cutlery and go up through gold and platinum, jewels and art... and then you see magic items, historical relics, unique and bespoke things but... the treasure list is 1-20 and those things are in the 25 to 30 range. 

Then you read ""add 1 per monster level"" or ""add 1 per dungeon level"" and it starts to make sense... you will no longer find copper and pottery... and you will start to have a chance at some big valuable stuff. 

\------------------------------------------------------

Maybe you are adventuring underground and roll a die to see if you encounter obstacles like a tight squeeze, a difficult climb or a tunnel submerged in water. Only a 1 will give you an obstacle... but you subtract 1 for each level you have descended under the earth. It has been some hours... you have climbed down a few times and felt tunnels slope downwards... you are about 5 stories down... and it is starting to feel like half the tunnels have some obstacle and half the caverns have monsters or dangerous hazards. But the walls... you start to see frequent gems pertruding from rocks, gold veins, ancient alien artifacts and saddly... the remains of past explorers and their gear. 

\--------------------------------------------------

As the gladiators fight each meets a fate... a die is rolled and a 1 might mean they are knocked down but can get back with 1 hit point if they chose to. Other results might result in unconciousness and serious injuries but beyond the d6 in the real of 7, 8, 9 and so on... you start to see severed or broken limbs, internal injuries and such. It turns out when they are dealt more damage than their remaining hitpoints they still end up at zero but the negative hitpoints are converted into a positive bonus to the die roll. Maximus... champion of a dozen fights before today gets hit hard with a gladius sending him to -5... or 0 but we add 5 to the d6 to see his fate... knowing it will not be good. The groud gasps, Maximus falls to his knees... but his head flies into the first row of the audience. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c77739b0>,rpg,1714222408.0
1ff87l0,Weird story: My game won an award. The award was tomatoes.,"Here's the story of the strangest\* thing to happen to me since I started making games.

❁❁❁

I love local conventions. I love that they’re universally bizarre and idiosyncratic, with traditions and cultures and venues that are all the product of their specific place and time. Please, give me a website that could have been made in 2004. Give me weird games run by weird people. Give me a church basement.

My most-local convention is called Cangames. It’s been running for 47 years. There are board games, RPGs, war games, and artisans peddling nerdy crafts. Every year, I stare at the elaborate foam constructions made by ancient men, who stand around their toy soldiers with rulers in hand.

This year, I was running my game [*Sock Puppets*](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/refling/sock-puppets?utm_source=Kurt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=can-i-offer-you-some-crying-no-just-a-cherry)*.*

*Sock Puppets* is… somewhat of a spectacle. The first half hour is spent casually chatting as you all make puppets from paper bags.

[`(Here's a picture of a toothy monstrosity I made that weekend.)`](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/c2b65048-d132-4acf-b4b9-eecc5949d6c0.png?w=960&fit=max)

The next hour is spent hissing passive aggressively at each other as you play out a failing children’s television show. What this means is that, for the first time ever, ancient men with rulers were staring at *me*.

One man (not ancient) approached me wearing a convention t-shirt. He asked me if I was going to be at the con on Sunday. I put down my puppet and said, “Maybe! What’s up?” And he said, with a cryptic smile, “There are awards”.

So I went to the con on Sunday.

I walked up to the front desk. I said, “Hey, I heard there are… awards?” The man at the desk confirmed. I asked when the awards were, and was told there wouldn’t be a ceremony since the man who used to run it retired. Fair enough. I said, “I might have won an award.”

The man at the desk said, “What makes you think you won an award?” This was a very cool and innovative way to trigger my imposter syndrome.

I said, “A man in a convention shirt walked up to me and said that… there are awards.”

The man at the desk said, “Oh, who was it?”

There is no way to know how much time passed as I stood processing that question. Stars were born and died, probably.

I said, “I don’t know.”

The man at the desk said, “Hmm. Maybe Todd.”

But Todd was not there. So left and returned later.

Someone new was at the desk. This time, I knew what was happening, and I had a tidy little speech. I said, “Hello. It is possible that I may have won an award. A man walked by me yesterday and said awards exist. He was wearing a fancy t-shirt. His name could be Todd.”

The person behind the desk said, “What was the award for?”

This was another question that left me slack-jawed like the puppets that brought me there. Working together, we determined that the only possible answer was, “Best Addition to an RPG”. (There is no “Best RPG”.) I would later learn that my competition was a game with dice made of sugar cubes.

But the award was not there (and neither was Todd), so off I went again.

At this point, I got a text from the con’s RPG organizer: I had indeed won the award. So I showed up later that night and claimed my prize: an adorable, extremely campy plaque with a dwarf on it.

[`(This is the plaque. A dwarf jumping out of a phoenix egg. Are dwarves birds?)`](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/00d5e080-424f-425d-9a6e-1838d429d07b.png?w=960&fit=max)

But that was not all I had in store for me. The two RPG people now behind the desk (thank you, Kevin and Jason) looked at each other and smiled. Kevin said, “You need your tomato!”

I said, “What?” as he pulled an entire tomato sapling from behind the front desk.

He passed me the plant and said, “We have extra!” like that explained everything.

I said, “What?” again.

He shrugged and said, “Local con!” like that explained everything. Which in some ways, it did.

[`(Anyway, here is my tomato plant. It's grown little yellow tomatoes.)`](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/507d46b2-652e-4580-a3f5-40b667b8dd98.png?w=960&fit=max)

1hqih0j,You aren't comfortable roleplaying.,"[[EDIT:addendum to title

You aren't comfortable acting, but that's what you came here expecting your roleplay to be.]]

Hey, 
This is sort of a PSA that i'm sure exists somewhere else but I've run into it a lot recently. I'm a sort of forever DM and play a lot of systems because I love the variety. I also try to get new people to play and when they come to the table they aren't comfortable roleplaying(or acting more specifically) but still want to play their character in a narrative way.
This is important because I reward ""roleplay,"" so if you have a DM like that this might help.


Charisma is obviously the most common check. If you don't want to RP, I let a player explain what the goal of their words or actions.
Example:

Player: ""I want to convince him to give us a better deal on these items.""

DM: ""Alright, explain it to me, how or what is the main point of your characters effort.""

Player: ""My character explains that if we can use these items we will do better on our next mission and will reward him with more than we can right now.""

DM: ""Alright, that makes sense roll for it with advantage.""

Then i'll go back to doing my voices for my npc because if I do it even when they don't, maybe it will help them over time, especially if they see silly characters.

I know it's not much on appearance, but just having them take that extra bit of information to think about it and narrate  a bit has helped some of my players get a little more into Roleplay without so much discomfort. 

P.S.

Fun-employment is also a great game to practice RP antics. 

Edit:

I wrote a long response to someone, and I am realizing now ""roleplaying,"" was too general a term. My sincerest apologies.

Voices are not required, nor do I look for players doing voices. This is for the people who come to the table expecting to act like characters in podcasts they listen to.

I meant this for those people who like to do a voice or persona themselves to embody their characters. I meant this as a way to start getting them to their own expectations, and yes I do enjoy doing voices and it does seem to help some less comfortable people want to join in because I am not Voice actor.

What I actually consider RP is using the function of a player characters knowledge, logic, actions, and intent for goals and scenes. Like many of the examples given in the comments. 

But I also do like voices, as do most of my players for their own characters. But that is a tiny part of our immersion, not the actual RP. 

Edit 2: An addendum to the title. I've have seen the error of my ways.

1blv76s,"I am so damn upset, so I have to rant.","I am beyond infuriated at this moment, and I just really need to vent.  
I have a group of friends, and I will alter the names for everybody, so here we have the group: Me, Kim, Rasmus, David & Jonathan.  
Together, we have all been playing Traveller for about 1.5 years. That scenario finally came to an end, so now we moved over to a new game master, that would be Kim. I am always the GM in any game, so I am beyond excited to be a player for this.

  
We are going to be playing ""Things from the Flood"" (Tales from the Loop). I already had the rulebooks, as did Kim. We all wrote in the WhatsApp group and voted on a date, that date would be today, on the 23rd. A Google Calendar invite is sent out to everybody, and **everybody** RSVPs with a yes.

  
During this period, I am just studying the rulebook and trying to get a ""feel"" for the game.  
I am used to classic dungeon crawling TTRPGs as well as Sci-Fi RPGs such as Traveller. I have also delved into horror, such as Call of Cthulhu, but I have never played a Year Zero Engine game or anything like Things from the Flood. This looked very interesting.

  
During this time, Kim is also studying the rulebook.

  
On the 23rd, everybody is just going to sit down at my place and create characters together. Very similar to Traveller in the sense that everybody should be present for a character creation event, and that it shouldn't be done solo by somebody else.

  
So, three days ago, David says he has to decline attending. ""It turns out that I forgot my birthday. I am so sorry, guys. Would you be OK if I created a character with you before the first session starts?""  
We all unanimously agree that this is okay.

  
Today is the day. I help Kim by printing out character sheets and reference sheets. I spent 2 hours cleaning my apartment with my husband since we are having guests. I go to the store and buy snacks and drinks for everybody, since I am the host, I think I should provide some kind of food and beverage.

  
One hour before we are about to start, Jonathan is JUST ABOUT to step on the bus that takes him to the city I live in when we receive a text in the WhatsApp group from Rasmus.

  
""Hey guys, I am so sorry, I completely forgot about today. I have turned off notifications on my phone for the past two days, and I didn't get any reminders. Sorry. But I will be unable to attend since I have other things planned now. Best of luck today!""

  
So, Jonathan writes then; ""Is there any point for me to come over?"" I reply with, ""No. Don't come, go home.""  
I call Kim, who is currently at a birthday party with his kids, and inform him of what has happened. He is infuriated and says he still wishes to see me to hang out.  
I reply that I am currently way too angry to meet anybody right now, and that I just want to be left alone, since I think this is so unbelievably disrespectful.

  
We have Google Calendar reminders, we have a WhatsApp group, and still, this somehow happened. And, it is important to point out that we are all in our 30s, so finding time for this is rather hard, and we have to move things around to make it work.

  
Kim's wife was luckily at home, so they had not arranged a babysitter.

  
Another clarification: This is not the first time, but the third time in a row that Rasmus bails on us last minute. But it has never been 1 hour before the game.  


I am sorry, I am just very upset and angry, and I needed to get this off my chest.

I read the quickstart and mostly understood the rules, but my understanding of PbtA games is that they are heavily reliant on player agency and players understanding the mechanics and their options, and none of my players came prepared.

Partially due to my inexperience and partially due to that of my players, I ran an entire session of Avatar without any balance actions or combat (lack of combat was largely on them, but I could have found opportunities to force it; maybe I should have interpreted more of their social roleplay as balance actions?). It was all basic actions/skill checks. With very minor modifiers, this basically means the whole session was basically just coin flips to see if an action succeeded.

And my players seemed to love it! They still got to interact with characters, make crazy plans that took dumb risks that somehow worked out, and act out fun characters.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c7964a40>,rpg,1712812046.0
1hw5on3,"To people who started their RPG journey with D&D, what made you finally play something else?","I'm old.  My journey began with AD&D 1E. To me, it was the perfect system. Never even wanted to look at another system. Not even another TSR product. SO many great games I missed out on because of stubborness.

Then I went to college and found a new gaming group. They were moving from AD&D to Call of Cthulhu.  Well, I didn't want to. Why mess with perfection? But my choice was to either play CoC or not play with my friends.

I actually planned to sabotage the game so we could get back to AD&D. But I REALLY liked CoC. I figured by session 3, I could do something to derail the whole thing and then we could get back to the far superior AD&D. Problem is, by the end of session 2, I was hooked enough to buy the CoC hardback.

And I'm more than happy to hop between game systems now and have been doing so since that session in 1990 when they forced me to play CoC.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c7a7f800>,rpg,1736293419.0
1i8tst9,"Why are new TTRPG players often so averse to playing ""normal"" characters?","I've been roleplaying for years, since my days in World of Warcraft, and this isn’t a new trend, but it’s something I’ve noticed too in TTRPGs. For the past year, I’ve been part of a local RPG association in my neighbourhood, playing regularly with people who are completely new to tabletop RPGs. It’s great to see their enthusiasm and creativity, they’re excited to roleplay and to create deep, meaningful characters. But one recurring issue is that many seem to avoid respecting even the basic norms of a setting in their pursuit of originality.

For example, in a Cyberpunk game, someone might create a character who refuses to use cyberware because ""being 100% human is cooler."" Or in a D&D game, I’ve seen a bard who doesn’t do music or even the idea of entertainment. While I don’t prohibit anyone from making what they want (roleplaying games are about fun, after all!) I do find myself wishing for more cohesion with the setting sometimes. When every character tries to be ""the exception,"" it can undermine the tone of the world or the group dynamic.

This isn’t just a new player thing, though. I’ve seen it happen with more experienced players, too, especially those who have spent years playing and feel the need to push boundaries. That said, I’ve noticed that over time, many veteran players tend to accept the canon and embrace archetypes, realizing that originality comes from how you roleplay, not necessarily what you play. A bard who loves music doesn’t have to be boring,what makes them unique is their personality, their backstory, and how they interact with the world.

So, why is there such an aversion to ""normal"" or canon-compliant characters? Is it the influence of social media, where unconventional characters are often showcased? Is it a lack of confidence, where players feel they need to stand out from the start to leave an impression? Or is it simply a misunderstanding of how settings are structured and why those structures exist?

For GMs and players: How do you approach this balance? How do you encourage creativity while still fostering respect for the setting’s canon? Have you also noticed this tendency in your groups, and how do you handle it?

To be clear, I’m not saying everyone must stick rigidly to archetypes or settings. But sometimes, playing a character who fits into the world as it can lead to more interesting stories and dynamics than trying to stand apart from it.

I’d love to hear your thoughts!

Edit: added more context

Edit 2: To give some context, in the Cyberpunk game I mentioned, one of my players made a character with absolutely zero cyberware, not even basic implants. In that world, where even the poorest people often have at least some level of cybernetic enhancement, being entirely ""natural"" is extremely rare. It’s an interesting concept, but it feels like they jumped straight to that archetype without considering other kinds of characters that could have cyberware while still being unique. I don’t stop them, of course, I want everyone to have fun, but it does feel like they’re skipping over a lot of what makes the setting rich and unique in the first place.

Similarly, with the bard example, I had someone create a bard but strip away so much of what defines that class that it didn’t really feel like a bard anymore. They didn’t play music, weren’t into performance, and their whole vibe leaned more toward being a rogue, but they still insisted on calling themselves a bard because they wanted to be ""a weird bard."" It’s not that I mind them tweaking the concept, but when it gets to the point that it feels like they’re playing a completely different class, I start to wonder if they’d have more fun just leaning into what they really want to play.

I totally get wanting to subvert expectations or stand out, I’m not against it at all! But I think the fun of breaking tropes works best when you’ve first taken a moment to understand the setting or the archetype you’re working with. When you throw yourself into it with no grounding, it can sometimes feel like there’s less cohesion in the group or the world.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c7c6f440>,rpg,1737720078.0

1f7o6f3,Had a player pass away (in real life). How to deal with it?,"I am part of a fairly tight knit RPG group. We mostly play online as folks have moved around and have several games going monthly with different GMs. One of our players stopped showing up on Discord several weeks ago. It was during a lull so we didn't think much of it. I started getting a bad feeling as time went on and finally googled them, learning they passed away.

We are all pretty devastated. One game they were supposed to be in just started. The GM is continuing the campaign and decided to keep their slot unfilled as a measure of respect. My campaign has been going for over a year and coming up on its 20th session. We have a lot of gas left in the tank but I feel weird continuing. I'm not sure what the etiquette is here and how to handle things if we keep going.

1bmt2mp,"Shadow of the Weird Wizard is out, why is no one talking about it?","I know many of us here are fans of Shadow of the Demon Lord, including me! It's a great alternative to DnD that's a bit more streamlined, has much more interesting character options, and overall improves on many of the things people complain about with 5e while offering a similar crunchy, more tactical, fantasy experience. The only thing that's made it a bit of a harder sell for some was the assumed Grimdark Fantasy setting that, while could be easily set-dressing'd out, did set a tone and expectation that was less heroic and more blood, guts, and depravity focused.

At my table we've been playing with the playtest of Shadow of the Weird Wizard, the less grimdark, sort of second edition of the game, and apparently it's actually hit release recently, much to the surprise of me and my playgroup. It' barely registered for me until my GM brought it up, and it seems to not at all been talked about on /r/rpg or on the general RPG sphere.

1i230q7,The coming dearth of D&D releases is an opportunity for indie creators ,"Yesterday in Polygon, Charlie Hall wrote about the remarkably thin release schedule for D&D in the next year, and the opportunity this represents for indie games. He is absolutely right, and there is historical evidence for it.

In winter and spring 1997, D&D publisher TSR couldn’t publish any new products because of outstanding debts to their printer. In that lull, distributors reported huge increases in sales of other games. SHADOWRUN sales increased 20% during that time. Palladium sales went up as well. It seems like people have money they want to spend on TTRPGs, and when they can’t spend it on D&D, that money goes to other TTRPG publishers. So Hall has historical backing for his idea. 

Go indies go!

1j6vgn3,Bubblegumshoe gives me something I never knew I was missing in other ttrpgs: I always feel like I am playing a game.,"I've been a player in a bubblegumshoe campaign for nine sessions so far, and although I was neutral on the idea of the system before we started (I don't actually like the teen mystery genre), after trying it, this might be my favorite system I have played so far.

One thing I love is the social skills. Rping with friends is always a lot of fun, but there often isn't much mechanical tension in the social gameplay of systems we've done. The game stops, and we act with an occasional dice roll to see if something worked. In bubblegumshoe, you have limited points in each skill, and they don't refresh until the adventure ends. So I am constantly thinking, ""Is this the time to use a point in gossip? I might be able to build an advantage for later in the mystery... but I might need it later; what if the PERFECT opportunity to burn a point comes up and I don't have one!"". It brings the resource management I usually associate with combat or dungeon crawls to social interaction, and I LOVE that.

Relationships are another thing I have found mindblowing in this game; I have often run into the probs in games, both as a dm and a player, where the group befriends some powerful person who can help them out. However, how MUCH they can help is always an issue; as players, can we ask them to solve all our problems? How often can we do that before they get annoyed? And as a GM, the same thing from the other side; I don't want my players to get an NPC to solve everything, but how much should they be able to help? Relationship points are fantastic because they show precisely how much goodwill an NPC has for a player and how often the player can draw on their connection with them. It means the GM and player know how this relationship works, what the NPC will do for the player, and how it will go. They can play around it! (like in my game, my pc has a friend who is a hacker. I started with a ton of relationship points with her, but if I asked her to solve everything for us, she would get tired of us, and I would have to spend game time rebuilding that relationship. A GM could always SAY that, but having the exact number helps decision-making and brings the GAME into it, you know?)

My favorite part is combat; namely it solves an issue I've had with a lot of systems, that a lot of the combats don't matter. The only consequence of a failed combat in many systems is the death of the pc, and a lot of the time (unless it is something like an osr game), the gm will not WANT a pc to die to some random mook. So we are rolling dice, but we all know the chance that we LOSE is tiny. However, with a bgs throwdown, there are real consequences to losing, but the consequences are something that ADDS to a PC's story, makes it more complicated, and opens up new avenues for both the pc and the GM. It isn't the end of the story in any way, so the GM will be much more willing to have all throwdown ACTUALLY losable.

Other systems I've played have had some similar things. Vampire: the Masquerade v5 has gotten the second closest to this feeling, but bubblegumshoe just fits the story and mechanics together so smoothly it is like nothing I've seen. Every mechanical decision feels like a story decision, and every story decision feels like a mechanical decision. I never feel like the game has stopped, and no encounter feels inconsequential. It is just a ton of fun!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c7e72300>,rpg,1741480743.0
1crp8p6,TTRPGs require effort. ,"I had someone tell me that ttrpgs requiring effort isn't entirely true. It upset me because I've been in the hobby for near two decades, running as a  gm for a little over a decade (a relatively short amount of time), and I have never once thought that way. I felt dismissed and invalidated.

Before we even get to sit down and begin playing there's dedicated effort spent on getting the group together. 

First I find the people that are interested and can coordinate our schedules to sync up and play. Not a small task, especially if you're starting a new group.

Then I always do the optional sesh zero with anyone I haven't run a game for before. Being sensitive to stuff like domestic violence or sexual assault is important to me as ive seen first hand how hurtful it can be to impact someone that way. Explaining safety tools and setting expectations for behavior is key to finding the very simplest of common ground to build a foundation on.

Then I ask questions about the type of game we want to run/play together. Do we want episodic adventures or something more epic in scale lole lotr. Do the players want combat and loot to be the focus or just when narratively fitting? Is setting important? What about handwaiving resources or survival mechanics? Is there plot armor for our furry critter friends? Then I find system that fits into the style of game we're looking for. 

Do I own a module that fits within the groups preferences or do I need to write it from the ground up(hours of effort to days of effort)? Do I need to edit it to fit the group? Yes. Do I need to re-edit it day of because someone can't make it? Maybe...

Let's say you're just a player though.

You still need to put in effort to sync up a schedule and dedicate the time to show up and be present. Are you bringing snacks or drinks, do you need to travel? Are you the host because that can be a buttload of work before, during, and after the sesh.

Have you or are you going to read the rules? 
Take notes? Do you need roll up your own character or use a premade? Do you need to buy a mini or dice? 

On average my players are playing for 2.5 to 4hr sessions which is time they're investing that could be spent doing something else. As a working adult, that supply of freetime only ever seems to get smaller and smaller every year. 

I want to show my players respect by putting together an experience for them they'll find fun. Each session is a gift I carefully craft to varying degrees of success. I want my players to know I value their time and commitment and I show that by putting in effort into my games.

You are investing effort all along the way of getting together to play...and more often than not some amount of $$ too.

I haven't even talked about actually playing any system yet but I've made a multiparagraph rant post about it... sure some systems require less effort to run/play...but all systems do require effort.

1iiatu2,Solo roleplaying makes me a better GM and player,"Solo roleplaying is doomed to be underated forever and this is a vain attempt to convince you to try it. We need more solo roleplaying. Because once it clicks, it's an incredible experience.

All my solo games use Mythic Game Master Emulator 2e, that works as a ""GM"" while you play a normal TTRPG. I always make a *troupe* of characters, not a just a single one. There are other solo games that are standalone, others use a single character, but I know little about that stuff. The way I play, the experience carries over to playing with other people better.

### Learn how to GM

I will not offer to GM a game I didn't play solo. It's too valuable as a practice and I feel uncomfortable if I don't have it.

You can take your time. It's just you, no one is hurrying you. So you can slowly figure out how to interpret a roll and improvise from that prompt, review the rules of the game and figure out how things work, try different things...

Mythic relies on your expectation, on your idea of how a game about X usually goes. So you develop a strong sense of what a game is about, that allows you to more easily come up with stuff on the fly. I can GM a Star Trek Adventure because I played a couple of those, I put my years watching episodes into practice, so I have an ingrained structure in my mind. I know how star *treks*.

It also throws random events and weird twists to your expectations. So you practice how to answer unexpected situations or add those twists yourself. The idea you had for this adventure is suddenly cut in half, something unexpected appears, you got bored and went off the rails... and you learn how to take that feedback.

I notice how I developed a sense of how time flows during an RPG session. I know how much it takes to get through X amount of content. And how characters might flow and move through an adventure. Both mechanically and narratively. How much HP they tend to have after some fights, and how pissed off they tend to be.

You are wearing both hats: GM and players, at every point you see the game from both angles.

### Learn and test a system

No matter how much you memorize a book, you need to play a game to learn it. Only the experience of actually implementing the mechanic counts.

With solo roleplaying, you are testing the characters and the rules under a stressful and unpredictable environment. You aren't just theorycrafting. You play fights in the middle of a scenario and a story.

Some games have weird mechanics. Not everyone in my table will get a BitD, PbtA or FATE kind of game. So here is a chance to give an honest try to those weird systems. To see them in action and figure out what they are about. How they work in a story.

You will know your stuff because you played it. If someone asks a question, you will answer from experience.

### My first steps at homebrewing and ruling

Sometimes I hate the emphasis people give to homebrewing and ruling. Because it assumes GMs have to be game designers, sometimes even fix a game on the fly. Which is a rare talent that shouldn't be expected from all GMs.

Again, solo roleplaying is a safe place to practice all of this.

Make a ruling, roll the dice a couple of times, make another one and see how that one works. Come up with a new system, try it out for a couple of scenes or sessions. Tweak a character or rule... anything goes and you can always scratch and try again.

You will also develop a sense of *which* situations tend to require rulings or tweaks. And probably develop and test rulings that will cary over to your games. Here's an example:

> In Panic at the Dojo characters have three stances with different moves and playability. Enemies tend to have only one (Bosses several).
> There is an advancement system that adds new stances to PCs and enemies. I decided to scrap it. Because *I know* that keeping track of all that stances can be difficult for a player and for the GM.
> And I get to test the new advancement system I came up with, to see how satisfying it will be.

### Resources for GMing

I noticed that I'm less invested in what game the table chooses to play, because I can play my favourite game anyways. I'm more open to try different games, I don't mind much that some people only plays D&D. It made me more comfortable an the tables I play in.

And if I offer to GM a game, it will be a game where I have *hours* of solo experience. I will know the game intimately, which will make my offer more interesting and personalized for the people I'm playing it with.

I will be able to walk people through character creation better. Because not only I made several characters and NPCs, I played with them. I will run that first session more smoothly because I have a lot of practice with the rules.

I will have NPCs and adventure ideas that are already play tested. Probably even whole worlds and backstory.

And Mythic GME is an amazing tool for helping improvisation. Lots of good random tables, answer any question. Make a random event to spice things up...

### It's just fun

Admit it, you never played Lancer. You love it, but never had a chance of playing it.

Now you do. Play any game, with whatever characters you want, in an adventure about what interests you.

I will be the first one to say that Mythic and solo gaming in general takes some times to get used to. As I said, it's very DIY, and each of us has to develop a very personal style.

But once you get past that initial hurdle. It's amazing. The game takes a life of it's own. And it's a son of a bitch. Mythic is evil.

My final point is that solo roleplaying can be intense. Very moving emotionally. Many solo roleplayers will eventually have some story where they ended up crying.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c7f15580>,rpg,1738764777.0
1f5pcxs,The ORC License was released over a year ago now. How is it holding up?,"Now that we've had time to collect ourselves from time spent after the OGL crisis, how are you all feeling about the ORC License, and related, other niche licenses creators have used to promote third-party creators for their games? I've seen a few smaller licenses crop up, like the [Shadowdark RPG License](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/blogs/shadowdark-blog/faq-on-the-shadowdark-rpg-third-party-license), the new [Draw Steel Creator License](https://www.mcdmproductions.com/draw-steel-creator-license), but few I find sticking to the ORC, and a few more still working with the OGL. Most of the indie stuff I see that wants to promote derivative works use the CC-BY license (and its relatives) as well.

What do we make of this? There's a lot of distrust in companies, rightly so, about the misuse of legal documents that smaller creators don't know how to navigate, so the landscape is pretty rocky still.

1inpacr,"Did D&D 3.X, Pathfinder 1e, and D&D 5e set the bar too high on what mid/high-level spellcasters ""should be able to do,"" creating an unfavorable scenario for games like D&D 4e and Pathfinder 2e? How do other high fantasy RPGs successfully set expectations on the power level of spellcasters?","This, at least to me, is a complex scenario spanning multiple systems and multiple editions.

Back in 2008 to 2013, one of the main talking points during the *D&D* 3.X vs. *D&D* 4e edition war was that spellcasters were nowhere as strong in the latter game.

Since 2019, *Pathfinder* 2e has been facing a similar, smaller-scale edition war: the ""casters do not feel that strong"" critique. It is understandable, given that many people looking into *Pathfinder* 2e are coming from *Pathfinder* 1e and *D&D* 5e, where spellcasters can achieve spectacular, encounter-trivializing results. To me, plenty of the discourse over *D&D* 5e spellcasters reads something like: ""Wizards are not that strong; if the DM plays the monsters right and has them prepare, the wizard can only manage to [insert stunt that still makes a mockery of the encounter-building guidelines and surpasses anything an equivalent martial could have done].""

How do other high fantasy RPGs, then, successfully set expectations on the power level of spellcasters, without running into the same ""my wizard does not feel as strong as they would have been in *D&D* 3.X, *Pathfinder* 1e, or *D&D* 5e"" criticism?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c8b43f80>,rpg,1739362046.0

The players made their own characters and the quick reference sheets had:
* Summary of what each of their character’s abilities do (1-2 sentences)
* all ability rules copied from rulebook. (Further down for reference when needed)
* Organized between: Combat, Investigation, Social, and Miscellaneous Abilities. (So they didn’t have to sort through combat stuff when looking for social abilities and such)
* Health tracker
* Important stats like Defense, Initiative, etc…

For quick reflexes system sheets:
* How to make a skill roll. 
* Attack rolls and damage tracking. I’m

The depth of the setting and adventures and quality of the tools and such are great. It’s a shame it’s a relatively difficult game to get a group to try, cause I’d be on it all the time otherwise.

1f0c6de,Fabula Ultima is the game you are looking for - a review,"Hi everyone. More often than not, when I see posts that are looking for a game with certain features I can't help but suggest Fabula Ultima because it satisfies so many needs at once. So, I thought I'd rather post my review of the game, ideally to convince you that this is in fact the game you are looking for (or not - I'll also go into that).

# Summary and recommendation

If anything, read this section. I'll go into further detail starting the next one.

**What does this game do?**

* Provide a strong framework to run fantasy games with a JRPG feel.
* Tell the tale of heroes-to-be, and larger-than-life villains, in an adventurous setting.
* Provide medium-crunch rules with a focus on narrative and interesting tactical choices.
* Provide streamlined rules for combat that gives you the feel of a JRPG during play.
* Provide interesting class choices, with a fun character creation where you can go wild making the character you wish.
* Provide consequences for failure, death being rare and player-driven.

**What does this game not do?**

* Tell stories about survival or with a sense of realism.
* Provide strong tactical rules for those oriented to tactical gaming, including grid-based combat. This game is theater-of-the-mind oriented.
* Provide extensive resource management. You just track Hit Points, Mind Points, and Inventory Points. Not even ammunition is tracked.
* Tell stories about villains, or about normal people - this game is about extraordinary people that will act heroically.
* Provide gritty gameplay with a true sense of looming death.

# Premise and Design Goals

Fabula Ultima is a game that tries to emulate JRPGs in a tabletop RPG format. For those of you who don't know what this means, think of Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Chrono Trigger, or games that are similar to these, you've most likely played them.

In the rare scenario that you still don't know what this means, it means the following:

* It is a game that provides the ability to play **medieval fantasy adventures**, or likewise, **adventures in settings usually supported by JRPGs** which can range from modern, to naturalistic, to futuristic, but all of them tied by **a group of heroes that fight the forces of evil**.
* As such, it needs to **emulate the relationships between characters** because JRPGs are also about the feelings each character has and how those relate to other characters.
* Battles need to support **interesting tactical choices**. In a JRPG you usually choose builds, strategize around a challenge, and execute your plan. Fabula Ultima needs to give PCs the ability to do this.
* On top of this, **combat scenes have to feel like a turn-based CRPG**, and this means you need to make a choice of what action you will perform, and to only track those things that matter. Ammunition, for example, is not tracked.

There are also other design goals for this game:

* It is a **medium light crunch game** most of the time (although this is subjective, we can argue it is squarely into medium crunch, but it is no crunchier than this).
* It is a **narrative, fiction-first, theater of the mind game**.
* It needs to be **flexible enough in terms of character creation** so that players can make choices to bring their wildest ideas into the game. JRPGs support a wide array of character and this game supports them very well.

As such, Fabula Ultima is a narrative game that aims to emulate JRPGs. It's an uncomplicated, very streamlined game that is perfect for those looking for heroic game alternatives.

Here's how this game achieves these goals.

# Setting

Fabula Ultima provides no standard setting. Instead, it encourages everyone to create their own settings. But the game doesn't leave you hanging there, it provides the following tools to create your world:

* The Eight Pillars: Eight tenets every setting must follow, to a greater or lesser extent.
* Three different setting styles: high fantasy, natural fantasy, techno fantasy. Each has their own vibe. The group is encouraged to create their own setting, and it's not mandatory to follow each strictly. But these are good guidelines to have an idea about the themes common to those settings.
   * Each setting style has their own splat book as well, with natural fantasy being released in English sometime next year. The other two have been released already.
* World creation guide: The game encourages the group to create a setting together by asking questions and drawing things in a map. There's nothing wrong with bringing your own world and skipping this section, but consider the following - Fabula Ultima can and will push you back if a player decides to use a Fabula Point (more on that later) to declare something you did not prepare for, this might very well undo your world building. In that scenario, remember that whatever you do not present the players is the same as that thing not existing.

# Core mechanics

Dice rolling is simple enough. Each character has four stats: Dexterity, Insight, Might, and Wisdom. Each is assigned a die rating from d6 to d12. A basic check has you pick two of these stats (can be repeated) and roll the corresponding dice, perhaps adding one or two numbers on top. This is exactly how Ryuutama plays, if it sounds familiar.

Multiple check types are rolled into this: basic checks vs a difficulty level, opposed checks, open checks, group checks, etc.

There are no ""skill lists"" similar to DnD. A ""skill check"" as in DnD is just a roll of two dice, the GM determines what is rolled in what situation. There's a list with examples of common checks in the book.

Certain checks can be done against a clock, in this case there's a series of rolls that need to be done to work towards some objective.

**Fabula Points (FP):** Characters have three *traits* that are words that describe this character: one describes how the character seems themselves, one describes the emotional theme of that character, and one describes their origin. On top of this, characters can have bonds with other characters, organizations, NPCs, etc. For these scenarios, players start the game with a stash of Fabula Points - if you have played Fate, this works very similarly. You can pay a FP to invoke a trait to reroll one or both dice; to invoke a bond and add its strength (number of emotions attached to it, max 3); or to declare a new story detail, a fact that must not override other previously declared facts.

Do note how this last point is what fights bringing your own world to the table. If you do, make sure to stay open to players declaring story details!

# Characters

Each character starts at level 5, and can grow up to level 50. For each level, a character will pick a level in a class, and then will pick a skill from that class or level up an existing skill that can be leveled up (also called *skill level* or SL).

On character creation, a player has to assign the initial 5 levels into two to three different classes. This means **players are forced to multiclass**, putting all your levels in a single class is forbidden. This however also means classes are bite-sized, each class only contains skills pertaining to that class. Mixing and matching classes is dead easy. Consider these restrictions:

* A class cannot have more than 10 levels assigned to it.
* A level 10 class is called ""mastered"".
* A character cannot have more than 3 non-mastered classes.

There are 15 classes in the core book you can pick from, and ~~10 more among all splat books, giving the sheer total of 25 classes~~ you can pick from to create the character you wish.

**EDIT:** I fumbled the class calculations. It's 15 from the core book, 11 from all splat books, and 2 extra classes. The grand total is 26 from the books, and 28 if you include the extra classes. Find them here in case you don't want to grab the splats just for the classes alone: [https://crystools.smug.cat/](https://crystools.smug.cat/)

# Equipment

A character has two hand slots (main and secondary), one armor slot, and one accessory slot. All characters can use most weapons, and some are martial weapons too which are usually more powerful. Even spellcasters can use arcane weapons to deal decent damage. Some equipment have different qualities that grant things such as elements or special effects to the weapons.

# Magic

Spellcasting is also not complicated. Certain skills grant you spells (you pick a spellcasting class, then you level up a skill that grants you a spell, then you pick a spell), and the spells have you spend mind points or MP (which is not for spells only, all classes have skills that make use of MP) which apply an effect, which can be offensive or not.

**Rituals:** Spellcasting classes can also cast rituals. Rituals, as complicated as they may sound, are simple. These are open-ended, non-combat effects characters can perform. They just require a simple check after the GM and the player have agreed on how this will look like. Powerful effects might require rare items before casting the ritual.

# Combat

Turns are *group turns*. Each party has a turn, then that turn is over and is then passed to the opposite party. Within each party, the GM or the players pick one character that has not yet acted during the round, that character does an action, and then passes the turn to the opposition.

Initiative uses the group check rules - players initiate a group check (one leader is chosen, everyone does the same check as the leader with DL 10, then the leader does the check with the bonuses granted by their teammates, which have their own initiative also added to the check) and compare the result with the highest initiative among enemies.

Offensive rolls, both attacks and spells, use a check that is compared vs the enemy's defense or magic defense as it corresponds. If successful, that player looks at the dice and picks the highest number among the dice, that's called the High Roll (HR). Then, the HR is added a number depending on the spell or the weapon, and that much damage is inflicted against the opponent, deducting the HP correspondingly.

Other actions that can be done are:

* Change your weapon by another one
* Spend Inventory Points to ""create"" items from your backpack and apply their effects
* Protect an ally from melee attacks
* Work towards an objective, filling a clock
* Hinder an enemy, causing them a status effect (slow, dazed, shaken, weak)
   * A status effect steps down a corresponding die. There are two more: enraged and poisoned which step down two dice, but these can only be caused by skill effects.
* Study a situation or an enemy
   * This is an open check vs fixed difficulties, you get as much info as your roll result
* Do something else not covered by the rules

One turn grants one action. Do note how there's no ""movement"" action: there are no distances tracked, and thus no grid and nowhere to ""move"" to.

Melee and ranged weapons mostly differ because the latter can be used against flying enemies, the former cannot. Other than that, they work the same.

**0 HP:** Upon hitting 0 HP, players are given a choice. You can either surrender or sacrifice yourself.

* Surrender: You no longer can fight in the scene. The GM decides your fate **which cannot be death**. You ""respawn"" in the next scene with half your HP (your ""Crisis"" score), and you undergo a consequence due to your failure.
* Sacrifice: If a villain is present on the scene, or if your sacrifice would benefit a character you have a bond towards, or if your sacrifice will make the world a better place (two of these must be true), you can choose to sacrifice. Your character dies, but also provides a crushing victory otherwise unattainable. Think of the fighter that deals single-handedly with a massive army, and wins, but at the cost of dying.
   * As such, revival rules are non-existent. You cannot revive a dead character.

# GM Guidance

GMs are provided plenty of guidance through the book. It is very well organized and provides multiple rules about how to journey across the land, how to create new character bonds, how to create NPCs, monsters, price of goods and services, providing rewards, etc.

NPCs are of most importance here. You are provided with three different ""tiers"" of enemies: soldiers, elites, champions. Elites replace two soldiers, and champions replace any number of soldiers. This determines their max HP, max MP, and number of skills they can have. NPCs follow most character rules (but not all, such as bonds). There's a small bestiary with NPC examples per species types, and extensive rules to create your own NPCs.

Villains are written extensively about. They are the dark side of the characters, their counterparts, and unlike other NPCs they have their own stash of meta-currencies, **Ultima Points (UP)**. These are not replenished ever if at all, and once a villain empties their UP pool, they either stop being a villain or escalate and become a next-tier villain (tiers are minor, major, supreme; these determine the scale of their goals).

# And beyond

There's more I have not written about. Projects, heroic skills, rewards, character growth, etc. I encourage you to give this game a try if you're interested. **Press Start** is a free supplement you can grab to give this game a test drive, so you know what you'll be dealing about.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c8d26f30>,rpg,1724524299.0
1cx0fgb,Just had a disaster of a session,"I know there's not really much to discuss, I just wanted to vent a little.

I tried running a one-shot at a local game meetup tonight. At these events, typically a handful of people will offer to run indie RPGs and everyone else will join whichever game sounds most interesting. In the past there have been roughly 20 people to attend. My partner was accompanying me tonight, and 3 other people joined my game. Of the 3 others, one of them was great fun and really nice to talk to, but the other 2 people were quiet, passive-aggressive, and seemed thoroughly confused about the entire game. At times, I actually wondered if they even knew what an RPG was, which was mystifying since one of them insisted he had actually already played the game we were playing. They never involved themselves in any of the scenes, any time someone tried to get them involved they would just shrug and say ""I don't know"" or literally just stare at their character sheet and not respond. Any time I roped them into a scene they would actively try to remove themselves from it as quickly as possible. The story just ground to an absolute halt every single time it started to get moving.

We took a 10 minute break about halfway into the session, and I decided to just pull the plug. I told everyone I wasn't feeling it and me and my partner left. I apologized to her for even inviting her to this meetup because it went so badly. I've had tons of fun at previous meetups for this group, and I've talked up how great of a crowd it is to my partner, so for her first experience to go this badly made me feel even worse. She was understanding of course, but I feel bad nonetheless.

Everyone has bad nights, that's just how it is. I was just really looking forward to this meetup and it ended up being a serious disappointment.

1hg8vcu,Was the old school sentiment towards characters really as impersonal as the OSE crowd implies?,"A common criticism I hear from old school purists about the current state of the hobby is that people now care too much about their characters and being heroes when you used to just throw numbers on a sheet and not care about what happens to it. That modern players try to make self-insert characters when that didn’t happen in the past. 

But the stories I hear about old school games all seem… more attached to their characters? Characters were long-term projects, carrying over between campaigns and between tables even. Your goal was to always make your character the best it can be. You didn’t make a level 1 character because someone new is joining, you played your level 5 power fantasy character with the magic items while the new guy is on his level 1. 

And we see many of the older faces of the hobby with personal characters. Melf from Luke Gygax for example.

1cpiqdv,I just realized that I understand the D&D only crowd.,"I got into D&D back in the 6th grade in 1980. I couldn't actually afford to buy any D&D products till he Moldvay D&D boxed set came out. I didn't have anyone to play with on a regular basis. But I was really into it. My local hobby store sold other games: Traveller, Runeuqest, Top Secret, Gamma World, ICE games. But I didn't care. I only looked at D&D. I remember buying Dragon Magazine religiously, and completely skipping any article that was about something other than D&D. Back then, that wasn't a lot. I wasn't even interested in looking at another game.

I remember my brother bought Gamma World. I checkd it out and even played a game. But I dismissed it pretty quickly because it was not D&D.

Then I got to college. And I found a regular gaming group. We'd play once a week. and occasionally hang on weekends. Well, this group played LOTS of games. When I joined the group, we played AD&D. But we quickly switched to CoC, then Robotech, then GURPS. I was actually looking forward trying a new system after a campaign ended. Being forced to play new games by my group finally broke D&D's hold on me and let explore other systems.

Then I finished college and moved in with my wife. RPGs were not really on my mind and when I thought I would get into it, I walked into my local hobby store and saw an insane amount of 2E AD&D products and decided I was out. The insane amount of books scared me off.

Fast forward to the release of 5E. I was very interested. I bought the PHB within months of release. Sounded cool. I joined a game a few years later when my kids were older. I didn't want to go away for 4-6 hours a day, leaving my wife alone with a toddler and an infant.

I really wasn't having a good time. I felt things were too easy. I stuck with it for 2 years and then gracefully bowed out.

Now it's 2024, and I'm still interested in D&D. But I want to try new systems all the time. I wouldn't mind a 5E one-shot now and then. But I don't want to be in a multi-year campaign.

So, if you're a D&D-only guy, please stop limiting yourself. Find some online one-shot you can play and experiment a little. I used to be you 30-40 years ago. Now the world of RPGs is far more open to me.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c8f147a0>,rpg,1715437719.0
1imaxka,"On Crowdfunders and Failure, Relaunching WARDEN","Okay, so this happened. WARDEN's Crowdfunder (posted about it [Here](https://sh.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1if6n08/backerkit_warden_the_genreagnostic_d20_rpg/)) plummeted on day 5, and I decided to relaunch it today with a lowered Goal, revamped visuals and campaign stuff, cheaper base game and with freebies.

# [The New Campaign is here.](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/ghost-spark/warden-the-genre-agnostic-d20-rpg)

So, let's do a bit of a reflection, what did I do wrong on the first time? 

# Let's get real

There were a LOT of signs that I was doing something wrong, and that probably was visible to everyone, making the funding just not kick off.

So I think I'm going to go one by one through my mistakes, so you don't need to do the same mistakes as I do if you ever decide to run a campaign.

# Confidence in the product

I failed to create confidence in the product itself being effectively done. If you checked out the playtest document, you might have noticed that all the parts of the game are already written! But if you didn't, you were kind of left with my word on that. 

So, in the relaunch, I showed some preliminary bits of the layout I have done, and it also roughly shows what the book itself will look like when you get it to your hands. This is super important!

The layout also gives context to the art that already exists for the game, and helps people ease into what the game will roughly look like eventually.

# Too high a goal for funding

You know, looking from afar, asking 15k€ for a TTRPG sounds like a laughably small amount to ask. However, this robs the project from its context. Yes, there's currently a running Backerkit for the Legacy of Kain Mörk Borg hack that is doing ridiculous numbers. But that is a product with an existing fanbase. Two existing fanbases, in fact.

To me, the ""Funded in X minutes"" schtick is silly and kind of gauche. I didn't want to ""game"" the system so I could gloat about the speed of funding. I wanted the amount I ask to be realistic to the game I wanted to make.

However, this fails on two levels: 

First, I am not established enough. I am no John Harper or Tom Bloom, I don't have a fanbase to speak of who would help the project get to that amount. To be honest, Pathwarden, my best-selling game to date, hasn't actually accrued half of the amount I was asking! It's still very niche!

Second, I was thinking too big. I wanted WARDEN to be competitive with ""big boy games"" like Call of Cthulhu, Shadow of the Demon Lord, and yes, including Pathfinder 2e and D&D. This was the minimum I set for myself, which is quite unrealistic without outside funding or previous successes.

This underlines the biggest takeaway from this: **NO ONE WANTS TO PLEDGE FOR A FAILING PROJECT.** The game was dead on arrival because of this.

# Price point

After I launched Pathwarden, I felt like I set the price point for the game too low, as the game, even in PDF, is technically worth more. So WARDEN's PDF version cost twice the price of Pathwarden. This fails to take into account that generally, people balk at paying more than 20$ for a PDF. 

Do I think that is kinda unfair? Yes. But that's the established price point. As I went checking around the PDF price of many other trad games, I noticed they were all mostly in the same range, including Genesys and PF2, my two biggest inspirations for WARDEN. I somehow completely missed this fact as I did research.

So I lowered the price to 20€ for the PDF for the relaunch. It's simply the way to go.

# Being smart

If I was smarter, I would've used the tools I have to make contributing to the Backerkit more enticing. Especially if you're outside of my regular audience (which I do have, it's just very small). What is the tool in this case? Well, I do have a somewhat known game called Pathwarden, and slapping the PDF as a freebie basically doubles the worth of the PDF Pledge, without any extra overhead cost to me. 

It does hurt the future sales of that game, but getting this project out of the gate is way more important.

# Not enough visibility

So, a problem I had was that I made a project, without really contacting anyone in advance about publishing anything about it. I guess part of this is just not being established enough, meaning no one asks and no one cares, so I felt a whole lot of stress about it.

This time, I've already contacted a lot of people who might be able to help me carry this thing through.

# Bad timing

Launching a campaign on Backerkit during Zinequest is a silly, silly mistake to make. All eyes are on Kickstarter. Now, this is something I can't really fix (I cannot use Kickstarter due to country limitations), and this campaign was actually postponed for two months due to the holidays being a terrible time to run a Crowdfunder. 

I also didn't predict a massive recession, stock market drop, and a certain presidency also looming on the background, making people much less willing to spend money on silly elfgames. 

So in short, I just had really bad luck.

# Checklist

So, if you're like me and want to make a Crowdfunding project, here's a quick checklist to remember:

* **Confidence:** Build confidence in your product by showing what it looks like when finished, and by stating things clearly to show that you understand the scope of your project.
* **Scope:** Remember to keep the scope of your Crowdfunder realistic. You may overestimate the amount of funding you *actually* need to finish the game. This goes double if you plan on doing boxed sets and physical goodies (I avoided these for a good reason!).
* **Money:** Study the price points of other projects and products, and try to think about a realistic ratio of funding with the current reach that you have.
* **Worth:** Make the pledging worth it by giving a good deal, it's best to do this with previous products if you have any to give out, or maybe some extras you're planning on doing anyway. Remember that digital goods are free to give out!
* **Goal:** You want to make a project that can get funded fast. Cut scope as necessary! No need to speedrun the funding itself, but if it languishes too early, people will stop supporting it! Remember, no one wants to pledge for a dying product, even though the money doesn't leave their pocket unless you succeed!
* **Visibility:** Seriously, send those emails, to news outlets, relevant youtubers, whatever. I haven't gotten replies yet, but I'm trying my best to actually get people on board to get this project forward. 
* **Luck:** You can never account for all the variables that influence the campaign. So it's better to double check and make everything as foolproof as possible. Don't leave stuff hanging on luck. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c8f2cad0>,rpg,1739206841.0

1fpxet8,Do People Actually Play GURPS?,"I’ve recently gotten back into reading the Malazan series and remembered how the books are based on their GURPS game. 

I’m not experienced with the system but my understanding is that it is rather crunchy. Obviously it is touted as a universal system so it tends to pop up in basically every recommendation thread but my question is this: does anybody actually play GURPS? I would love to hear from people who have ran games using it or better yet, people actively running a game using GURPS. 

Edit: golly, much more input here than I expected. I’m at work so I can’t get into things much but I appreciate everyone’s perspective. GURPS clearly has much more of a following than I expected. It seems like GURPS can be a legit option for groups who are up to the frontloaded crunch and GM’s who are up to putting it together but perhaps showing a bit of its age compared to many of the new systems in the indie scene.

1hcey7m,"A perspective on D&D 5e that I have recently come across: 5e more as a ""social platform"" than as an RPG","I do not like 5e that much, but here is a perspective on the game that I have recently come across.

A long-time GM of mine, whom I played multiple years-long games under, moved to a different city as of late. They actually switched to DMing 5e as a system, and plan on sticking with it, because they find 5e to be a vastly superior platform for meeting and establishing rapport with new people and communities. Even one of the ""more successful"" non-5e RPGs, like *Pathfinder* 2e, is significantly worse as a platform for forging new social bonds, let alone a more obscure system.

This applies both in real life and online. 5e players and 5e communities are supremely more accessible and bustling than those of any other RPG.

Under this perspective, 5e might not be the best RPG, but it is far and away the best ""meet new people and forge bonds with them"" social platform among RPGs.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c9ad7e00>,rpg,1733984527.0

Having to look up a rule every five minutes and explain it to the one player who didn’t read the basic combat rules ahead of time, monster statblocks having so many numbers, half of which I only use in very specific situations, having to use a complex table every time I want to set a DC, and each turn you have players spending five minutes to decide what to do with their three actions… it’s all just a bunch of busywork that seems to add a level of nuance that doesn’t really seem to add much. I mean, I’ll keep running this game to see what it really has to offer, but I don’t think I’ll keep running it long term.

Compare that to Masks and some other more rules-lite games. Everything just flows, you can explain every rule in a few seconds and understand it in under a minute. And all of the unique mechanics are right there on the character sheet so nobody gets confused. Never mind that in PBTA games, the DCs are already set which speeds things up even more. And the lack of specificity lets me just whip up a ruling in a few seconds.

That’s why I like rules lite games over crunchy games.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c9f57290>,rpg,1711548364.0
1j14yrs,Free PDF with purchase,"I'm noticing an interesting split with companies that offer ""free PDF with purchase"" and those that don't.

It seems the older a company is, the less likely they are to offer a free PDF. These are my observations from the company I have dealt with:

'Old School' publishers

* WoTC/Hasbro - PDFs don't exist at all. Which is stupid.
* Paizo - PDFs cost extra.
* Troll Lord Games - PDFs cost extra, but they offer Print+PDF bundles at a discount.
* R. Talrorian Games - PDFs cost extra, but they participate in Bits and Mortar
* Chaosium - PDFs are free with purchase if you buy the book off their website. My attempts to get a free PDF from a retail purchase got denied. But they do participate in Bits and Mortar.
* Steve Jackson Games - PDFs cost extra. No Print+PDF bundles.

Newer Publishers:

* Arc Dream Publishing (Delta Green) - Show proof of purchase and they'll unlock PDFs on DriveThruRPG
* Mongoose Publishing (Traveller) - Show Proof of Purchase and they'll add PDFs to your account on their website
* Stellagama Publishing (Cepheus Deluxe) - Free PDF with purchase
* Independence Games (Clement Sector) - Freee PDF with purchase
* Zozer Games (Hostile) - Free PDF with purchase
* Sine Nome Publishing (Without Numbers) - Free PDF with purchase
* Catalyst Game Labs (Shadowrun) - Free PDF via emial with proof of purchase
* Modiphius (Star Trek Adventures) - Unlocked PDFs on DriveThruRPG with proof of purchasse
* Goodman Games (Dugeon Crawl Classics) - DriveThruRPG codes are printed in the book.

I'm sure there are other 'old school' publishers that offer free PDF with purchase. I just haven't bought from them. But there's definitely some kind of shift in mentality between older and newer publishers.

I never expect a free PDF. But I do expect a discounted PDF. Steve Jackson Games now sells all their GURPS stuff on Amazon as POD soft cover books. And most of the color soft cover books are $50. Every book is also available as a b&w softcover book for $30. But neither option includes a PDF. If I wanted to buy a softcover color copy of GURPS Magic, that would cost me $50, and then I would need to pay another $30 to buy the PDF. I'd happily give warehouse23.com another $10.00 for the PDF, but I'm not paying $30 for after spending $50.00 on the book.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c9f8f2c0>,rpg,1740850665.0

Absolutely fantastic book, with the same B/X-lite approach used by Mörk Borg, great flavor art and very fun character generation tables. The idea of swashbucklers and iniquitous sailors snorting undead bones pulverized into ash as some sort of recreational drug lends itself to many interesting storytelling beats. The “Dark Caribbean” setting is also a lot of fun *but* as with many of the Borg games, I wish it had been sketched in more detail. Anyways, seems like a very fun game which I can’t wait to run.

But then I joined that one Cyberpunk campaign and my expectations changed. It's a campaign where our backstories actually matter, we have ties and conflicts with factions, meet npcs from our backstories, we actually live in the Night City.

Now playing generic DnD is just dull to me. The gm has a script, my character has a backstory that has no importance, since we will never meet anyone who knows me, never do anything connected to my character, just navigate this premade story pretending to be this character, that could be a completely different one just as well.

I am gming my own campaign this way, having my PCs deeply tied to the world, having them meet friends or enemies from their backstories, my players love it, but I would love to play too and finding a good gm and party for it is just so difficult.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ca21e360>,rpg,1718064575.0

Both of DW2's designers (myself and Helena) plan to run games of it ourselves, but we also want to see who else is interesting in running or playing DW2 and team up with them. Dungeon World 2's design is well underway, and by the convention we expect to have publicly released a beta version of the game just recently.

GMing DW2 would be on a volunteer basis - we can't pay you or provide tickets or accommodations. Those who GM for us will get access to the alpha playtest (planned for late March) so you have more time to read and play the game before the convention. We can also offer plenty of food and water, and hopefully some gifts as a thank you.

**So if you plan to attend Gen Con 2025 and want to run or play DW2, please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/5KUvqU9izZ8pVHyv7) so we can get in touch.**

**What's Dungeon World 2?**

For those not already aware, [all rights to Dungeon World were bought from Adam Koebel and Sage LaTorra by Luke Crane and John Dimatos in August 2024.](https://discord.com/channels/236959672538628096/236960609218854914/1274036411162562651) They started engaging in the community then and hearing what people would want from a 'second edition' of Dungeon World. Adam and Sage stopped being involved in Dungeon World in any way after this happened.

[In December 2024 they announced that Spencer Moore (myself) and Helena Real (/u/HelenaRealH) will design Dungeon World 2.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/1hl1nkr/dungeon_world_2_announcement_from_luke_crane/)

We've been designing the game since a bit before that announcement, and we are very excited for what we have right now. It's still not finished, but we expect to have closed alpha playtests within a month or two, and a wide-open beta playtest another month or two later. The second announcement above also describes our vision for the game. We can't say too much about the game details yet, but will soon!

We'll keep doing communication updates, but if you want to get emails about DW2 in the future then [we have a form to sign-up for that here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvz-Zme5XOckfIGeBdVWaxk-jteTcNwIBNk3Y0M4o28rkWeA/viewform?usp=dialog)

When I was 12, my cousin, who I only got to see once even other month or so, and my Uncle, asked if I wanted to play a role playing game with them based on Star Wars.  That's how my uncle sold it to my parents.  Its NOTHING like Dungeons and Dragons, its Star Wars.

I mean, sure, as a DM I can make things difficult or create hazards that will counter how meta gamers try to over power the enemies or beg but having to overwork more than I have from homebrewing, scheduling, mapping, etc. kind of takes away from the fun 

Now, I've played a few decent other systems and not once have I seen where PCs are given the opportunity to be supreme god form from the start. It's different if, from adventures and PC hardwork, they have achieved God form ( or whatever).

Sorry for the long rant. Just, kind of seemed like a lot of folks here and outside of the Internet feel somewhat the same and coming from someone whose first experience was 1st Ed. and AD&D that my fiends parents had, it's a little frustrating to see the idea of imagination and adventure be turned into little more than video game, immortal heroes.

I've noticed in recent years an uptick in the western genre in RPGs(hell, I'm even making my own), but what I've seen is that the vast majority of these games heavily feature elements of the supernatural. Frontier Scum, Weird Frontiers, Down Darker Trails, SWADE Deadlands, and others, but there is so little of the regular old western genre that so many of these titles are based on. If you go and look on DriveThru and sort by westerns, you'll see that the most popular non-fantasy/horror game is Boot Hill, which hasn't seen an update since the early 90's. This is also a trend in videogames, too, so I've noticed, in that besides RDR2, all the popular western videogames(Hunt, Weird West, Hard West, Evil West, etc.) prominently feature the supernatural as well.

I know that popular fiction tends toward the fantastical nowadays, but the complete lack of regular old western RPGs is mind-boggling to me, considering how the narrative genre fits so well into the way ttRPGs are played.

Edit: Please don't get me wrong, I do love the weird west genre alot, it's one of my favourites.

1fz0l1c,The Mork Borg phenomenon,"I've had some thoughts lately that I would like to share with all of you, and see if it's just me and my mind behind this. 

Since 2020, Mork Borg has grown from a small indie game to a large-scale phenomenon, with dozens of Mork Borg products being systematically created. I've seen modules, adventure anthologies, beastiaries, spin-off titles, systems based on Mork Borg. They even released an action figure! It feels somewhat strange that a single RPG title got so much attention and grew so large in the span of only a few years.

Don't get me wrong, I have my fair share of MB products. I liked the aesthetic and the parodically dark world it creates, but how is it possible such a simple system based on OSR games to grab such a large portion of the RPG audience? 

One could argue that MB is 80% art and 20% game as Johan Nohr's AMAZING artwork fills every little part of every page, but there's little more than that. The systems it uses are not that unique and fresh, it's just more OSR that we've witnessed in countless other titles. But still, Mork Borg persisted over the rest, with Kickstarter being filled with ""Compatible with Mork Borg"" even more than the titles being ""5e compatible"".

You might ask, why I'm having such thoughts. Well, lately I've been seeing less and less designs based on Mork Borg, thinking that maybe its time is over. It made a huge leap in the market that is now slowly dying, the MB craze being over. And then, what do you know, a Mork Borg videogame is released! 

I am trying to wrap my head around the phenomenon that has been Mork Borg for many years and it still amazes me. Please tell me your thoughts on this. Is Mork Borg going to stay forever or was it just a phase?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2cb2fa150>,rpg,1728396269.0

I liked crafting a world, embodying various NPCs, and responding to the actions of my players. It was far more tiring than being a player, but I felt like I got a correspondingly greater amount of fulfillment from the experience.

1dn70n2,There's nothing like finding a group who is excited to LEARN a game,"The questions from the one user about how much people expect their players to delve into a game's setting or rules. I was surprised to find that almost everyone's answer was ""none"" or ""minimal"". It's incredibly strange to me, as people not bothering to get even the *basic* setting and rules down, not even *skimming* the book, just sound so dispassionate. I'm happy to teach alongside, of course, but they're not even putting minimal effort into understanding the game they're playing?

I wanted to run a game that pretty much requires that players understand the setting and rules to the point of reading half of a 400-page book. They just won't understand what they're actually doing otherwise. You might think, that sounds horrible, I don't want to do that. Most people don't.

But I finally found a group that *does*, and it's amazing seeing those people be passionate about the game they're playing itself. Enjoying the learning process, *wanting* to read more and understand. It's incredibly moving to see their excitement to *play* the game grow as they immerse themselves in it.

I don't expect that in every game. It may not even suit many games. But I also would not trade that experience for the world.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2cb790050>,rpg,1719211006.0

1fagqno,"""Rules light but with lots of character options""","I often see requests for RPGs here that are both

* rules light and

* have lots of character options

I'm never sure what to recommend, because having lots of character options (in my experience) implies more rules.

Games like D&D5E, Pathfinder, and GURPS can give you lots of character options because they have lots of rules for character options to pull on. A character can be better at certain stats or skills, mess with die rolls for attacks/damage/initiative, circumvent or lessen penalties (cover, perception, encumbrance), and they can do those things in broad circumstances or niche ones. And the game rules respond by defining those circumstances and giving the GM ways to interact with them on their side of the screen.

And rules light games (again, broadly and in my experience) have fewer of those levers and buttons to mess with. Bonuses often come in broad categories (a bonus whenever a roll applies to your background), or they might be new ""minigames,"" like a PbtA move that gives you the entire rules for a new ability (teleportation or whatever) right in the move text.

(PbtA in particular seems like a game that, to me, offers a bunch of cool character options, but I feel like I also see people who want ""rules light/lots of character options"" saying no thanks to PbtA specifically.)

I'm offering all this without judgment; I like all kinds of games. I'm just interested in others' thoughts and in being exposed to games I might have overlooked.

* What kinds of ways is rules density tied to character options? 

* Are there games that, for you, deliver on the request of ""rules light/lots of character options""?

* Is there a *kind* of rules or a *kind* of character options that are implicit in these requests?

1gf28qf,"48 hours left on The Between: Victorian monster-hunting, Carved from Brindlewood","tl;dr: [The Between](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/the-gauntlet/the-between) is a game about Victorian monster hunters dealing with supernatural mysteries (and their own pasts) while working to unveil the plan of a secretive Mastermind behind much of the horror afflicting their London setting. It uses Carved from Brindlewood mechanics, a sub-family of Powered by the Apocalypse games focused on collaboratively telling horror-mystery stories together. The game runs using a vast catalog of pre-written Threats, but none of them have official/canonical answers to their core Questions - the players must assemble a theory out of the Clues they’ve discovered, and roll to see how right they are. 

If you like PbtA games with super-specific, evocative playbooks, or want to really feast on a giant ‘menu’ of content to potentially run for your group, you could do a lot worse than this. $30 for a 3-book set digitally, $90 from them in hardcover (with decent rates on international shipping).

\-

For everyone else: Hello, everyone! I’m unaffiliated with The Gauntlet, but have fallen head over heels for the CfB system broadly and The Between in particular. I made [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1fhmvw1/the_between_comes_to_backerkit_in_one_week/) when this Backerkit campaign went live a month ago, but with a little over two days left, I want to highlight the bonus content they’ve already unlocked and what’s still left.

The core rulebook has 6 playbooks (and a 7th potentially unlocked during play!), 11 Threats to investigate, and a Mastermind to serve as the antagonist of your campaign - or at least, its first season. Shadow Society, an expansion book, adds 6 more new playbooks, another 20 Threats, and 3 additional/alternate Masterminds. Suns of Another World has 3 spin-off settings, alternate frameworks with their own 6 bespoke playbooks, plus Threats and a Mastermind unique to each - essentially separate, standalone games of The Between!

* **Ghosts of El Paso:** a Western; local notables trying to protect their town from a season of spirits
* **Unsinkable:** mystery at sea for the passengers and crew aboard a doomed Transatlantic ocean liner
* **Court of Wolves:** protect Louis XIV from the Satanists and werewolves allied against him

You could genuinely play this game for *years* before repeating any material (though there’s a lot of room for replays to go \*wildly\* differently with some branching choices). It’s full of clever, inspirational design. Despite a lot of obsessively-focused design, there’s enough wiggle room that one campaign could be horrifically brutal and grimy, while another could be more like two-fisted pulp with a bit of edge. With my home group, I’ve already got players speculating about “our *next* campaign” and “when *I* run this…”, which feels like some of the highest praise I could pass on. 

Give it a look! I’d love to hear your thoughts, and as a big fan of this game who wants to see it do well, I’d love to field any questions you might have. Their final few stretch goals include:

* 3 more playbooks (a gaggle of low-class henchmen being hunted by a serial killer, an Alice-like woman half-caught in daydream realm, and a chemist experimenting with a serum injected into their body)
* 2 more Masterminds (the vampire queen of a surreal otherworld who seeks to puppet the British monarchy and an aristocratic family of rival monster-hunters)
* a 4th alternate setting (with its own playbooks, Threat, and Mastermind!): **Blood & Coal**, about locals in Appalachia during the early Dust Bowl, fighting to preserve their home from demons

If you're curious, the [current edition of the game](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/360858/the-between-preview-edition) and of [Ghosts of El Paso](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/413131/the-between-ghosts-of-el-paso) are both free on DTRPG through this Backerkit's run!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ccdd0440>,rpg,1730227826.0

*First off, this is a self-promotion post. So, thanks for giving this post a look and a bit of your time.*

A couple of months ago, I released an OSR-inspired tabletop role-playing game of axes, runes, spirits, and legends, called Songs and Sagas. My twitter post blew up in popularity with like 22K views and 500 likes (even more unreal IMO considering the current state of the platform). Anyway.

I was really proud of the core and exploration mechanics I had designed, so I decided to open-license the game and publish a free creator kit and SRD for everyone to use. I then organized a game jam on Itch, and over 100 designers jumped on board, currently working on their own products to be ""Carried in Songs and Sagas"" (naming monikers is so fun \^\^).  

Now that we have 100 participants in the jam, I decided to celebrate by making the game **free for everyone**.

You can download the game on [itch](https://fari-rpgs.itch.io/songs-and-sagas) or go to [songsandsagas.farirpgs.com](http://songsandsagas.farirpgs.com) for more details around the game, creator kit, and what we plan to do next with the system.

Do keep an eye on the [submission page of the jam](https://itch.io/jam/songs-and-sagas-jam) because there are some pretty amazing designers working on their projects including the folks from A Couple of Drakes (Dead Belt, Court of Blades), Andrew Boyd of Pandion Games (Whispers in the Wall, Substratum Protocol), Matteo Sciutteri (Bloodstone, The Breach) and Alan Bahr of Gallant Knight Games(TinyD6, D6 System: Second Edition, SYMA)",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ccd7ecf0>,rpg,1724423463.0
1d7p2bg,"I have a gripe, Girl By Moonlight","No, not with the system. Eclipse is BRILLIANT, the playbooks manage to span damn near every common trope, the setting rules really manage to push each different campaign into a different genre while still maintaining a magical girl feel; to such an extent that it has opened my eyes in ways I wish they had remained shut. I did not need to realize that Neon Genesis Evangelion was barely a step away from hitting the same notes as a dark magical girl show, but now I can't unsee it, ever. So thanks for that.

But my gripe is with the settings.

There's a continuous textual and metatextual pressure to make these settings, and these characters, revolutionary in flavor, that I feel doesn't necessarily vibe with either the original inspirational material or with the threats directly faced in the world. 

Now, I'm no enemy to media featuring revolt. Brinkwood: the Blood of Tyrants is my favorite Forged in the dark game. That game wastes absolutely no time in informing you that each and every one of the rich and powerful are literal bloodsucking vampires, that the only reason they can't go back to being normal humans is that it would involve giving up their power, and that they all deserve to be killed and have their blood fuel the visceral fae masks powering the revolution. But see, that's the core thrust of Brinkwood, the inspiration and intent in a single short statement: Mask Up. Spill blood. Drink the rich.

Girl By Moonlight does not have this core, clear directive. It leans on magical girl media, such as Sailor Moon (about a literal space monarch reclaiming her throne), Steven Universe (about how genocide can be made all better with a song), Escaflowne (where a full third of the cast are some kind of royalty), etc. The repeated insistance that the world is a crapsack that hates them mostly leave me wondering why the PCs would even try to save it; this place seems awful, let the abyss or the leviathans or whatever have it.

Magical girl media is frequently and fundamentally about a desire to defend what currently is. The everyday oppression faced by Usagi Tsukino is having to take tests she's not ready for, not the very real rise of reactionary politics in Japan at that time, and Magic Knight Rayearth is set in a place of light and wonder that these three strangers decide to protect together, not a shitty tyrannical state they... Still decide to protect together.

Girl By Moonlight is an excellent game, but I'm left wondering if the writers have watched the media that inspired it.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2cce91190>,rpg,1717477001.0

1j3zy37,I think im going to kick/shadow ban a player for the first time and i feel kinda bad for it,"For context for the last 2 months i started to run a traveller campaign..i decided to run it online with people from my own country (wanted to speak in my language and not with my horrible accent in English)

So i searched for players (through Facebook)

And after 3 weeks of searching i got 5.,Sadly one of them is a problem player

The player (lets call him ben).  Ben at first seemed fine.. talking to him you understand pretty quickly that he has autism (they way he speaks, hes tone , Extra)

I thought ""well a little challenging, but i work with people with hy functioning autism before i could take my time""..  i was worng

Next few problems arous :

He is a technophob. The man straight refuse to learn the basics of discord or how to feel character sheets *but op you said he is autistic you need to halp him its hard to even non autistic people""

Correct. I did.. multiple times .did even a fully camed solo session with him . The problem is that kind of abeloust techo phobia kills an all hour from the session. We meet ones every 2 weeks .i cant let a player hag an hour every start of session.

So i gave upp on some things, i handled his character sheet , and he rolls through discord (wich took us an hour to try to teach him how to write /roll: )

"" Why didnt you let him to use his own sheet he feels comfortable to use""

Because he cheats . before discord rolling he rolled in person..i trusted him ... untill i notcued he didn't roll below a 10...at all . Its a 2d6 system..you roll alot in traveller .its.... impossible to only get bellow a 10. So i stoped it though thr discord bot

The man is straight upp rud to other players..he cuts them speaking alot of times , quickly gets aggressive, refuse to change his minde. He demands alot of spot light. .and kinda worst of all..he is extremely unseries. Like I dont run hard core noir drama game..there is funny moments.but not to this level.the man straight upp run on cartoon logic because he created a clown(traveller isnt a cartoon game..is more similar to the expanse in the idea that th character are extremely human)

Tbh..i feel shame.. players left the game because of him and the campaign died..its because mainly i felt shame from wanting to kick him(mainly because of autism) so i didn't ..but now i understand that by not doing it i ignored  the  others players..and my self (god i didn't enjoyed it)..

So im going to kick this player..i don't have fun the others dont and man im going to feel shit doing it

But tbh i see no other way

1bvcnm6,"Are you an ""I"" gamer or a ""they"" gamer?","I recently started listening to the Worlds Beyond Number actual-play podcast, and I keep noticing how two of the players most often phrase whatever their character is doing in first person, eg ""I grab my staff and activate its power,"" while another one usually uses third person, eg ""Eursulon stands on stage, looking awkward."" 

I started paying attention to a couple of my own regular games, and realized I'm more likely to use first person — I tend to identify really closely with my characters, if I'm enjoying a game. If I'm saying ""I snarl and leap at him with my claws bared,"" it's probably because I'm identifying closely with my character, and feeling their emotions. I tend to associate ""\[Character's name\] picks up a chair and throws it at the loudmouth in the bar"" phrasing with someone who isn't inhabiting the character so much as storytelling with them as a tool.

Have you ever noticed this in your own habits? Are you more an ""I"" player or a ""they"" player? Does either one sound odd to you when other people do it? Do you think there's any significant difference between ""I smile"" and ""My character smiles"" when you're gaming?

As a side note, sometimes on the podcast, the players use second person, which I find a lot odder. That's what first got me thinking about this. To me, ""You see me walking up to the dais, looking determined"" is kind of weird phrasing for a roleplayer — but maybe more natural for an actual-play podcast, where they're presenting a story to an audience as much as experiencing it for themselves.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2cda77f80>,rpg,1712199862.0
1frzy73,The Twilight: 2000 Problem or: Can a mechanic be too good?,"Hi

yesterday i gmed my first game of Twilight: 2000 and it went...fine. While i would not say that we had a blast, we laughed, planned and had a good time.

But i\`m not sure we should have.

You know, if you flip through the pages of the Players Manual, one feeling is predominant imho: This is not a world i want to explore. This is a world where survival is hard, there are no interesting locations beyond the horizon, just another radioactive crater, and inside its perimeters, there will be no deathclaws, just people trying to shoot you because you have clean water. Also, its a world that resembles the pictures from the news maybe too much. Combat is also deadly (as expected), and the PCs doll a D6 to determine their starting radioactive poisoning...which can never be healed.

Short stories about young people killing soldiers, and pictures of gruesomely wounded people emphasize this impression. There is a reason why the kickstarter of the German version, planned for march 2022, never went online.

So, on the one hand, i get the feeling that this game wants the players to feel uncomfortable, giving them a tiny glimpse of being inhabitants of a destroyed Europe, and being as much as a .... message of peace maybe? as a TTRPG.

But..

Twilight 2000 is on the same time military porn and a quiet well made war game. The largest chapter is the one for equipment, with 10 different drawings (which are well made) of assault rifles alone. You get stat blocks for a dozen different tanks, and a combat system that is not only deadly, but also lightweight, but opens a lot of options for the PCs. One of our core experience was sitting around the map while players plan there next move.

And the game comes with hexmaps. Lots of them. And while the combat is deadly and easy, it can still take quiet some time to figure out ranges, cover etc.

This combination creates two problems, in my opinion:

1. The setting and rules discourage the players from combat, because the results of it can be devastating if something goes awry. But one the other side, combat is, arguably, the most fun thing the mechanics have to offer. So, as a player, you might get into a situation where you don\`t want to get into fight, because it would be the dumbest idea for your character to do, but on the other hand want to fight, because you enjoy the wargame.
2. I think that, for making the players feel the unease their PCs are in, the game needs a zoomed in perspective. You need to describe details, the atmosphere, and there needs to be a lot of player buy in. But, sitting around a map and discussing tactics with your mates is literally the opposite of being zoomed in. I don\`t think that a lot of groups can make the switch from ""Playing a war game"" to ""Playing a modern horror game where the monster is the worst of all: mankind"".

I would love to here if anyone had similar experiences, or found a solution to the dilemma. (Or just explain to me that there is no dilemma at all).

Thanks for the read.

  
Edit: Thankys to everyone for the insights. I think the different answer show one thing about our hobby: That every GM, every Group can turn a game to their own needs. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2cdaa2750>,rpg,1727599390.0
1bvuoqj,Forbideen Lands: Reasons you should (or shouldn't) play this game,"[My fast-paced, video review](https://youtu.be/Z3zdgOQGF_s) of the game for people who don't want to read.

&#x200B;

This is a game that, once upon a time, I saw got heaping tons and tons of praise and several awards for its design.

I was skeptical at first, because I don't adore survival/crafting mechanics in pretty much any game and the game emphasized a focus on ""hex-crawl exploration"" which has always been tiring and kind of boring in my experience.

However a year ago I ran a full campaign using this system, and good god did I fall in love with it.It IMMEDIATELY has an extremely charming aesthetic; they employed veteran fantasy artist Nils Gulliksson to absolutely nail the Golden-Age-of-RPGs vibe of the setting. It presents itself like classic, cheesy, conan comics and nerdy basement posters.

The actual gameplay is weird at first; it comes off as an OSR game but there's a surprising amount of survivability to the characters (I got through the campaign with a total of 3 character deaths). If your characters live long enough they get pretty strong, and learn very useful, cheesy abilities.

Threats never stop feeling threatening, however; no matter how strong your character is, a dragon is absolutely horrifying to fight, and even a simple zombie can still give your character a “this-many-days-until-you-insta-death” clock if they score a single bite on you.

The exploration can feel clunky sometimes, specifically when you want to fast-travel to the next town or you’re traveling SEVERAL in-game days without much physical progress, but when it’s not clunky it’s really charming and engaging. Every character has something to DO doing the travel/camping phases, and everyone gets to feel useful and have numerous chances to roleplay.

I adore this game, and I think it’s the solution for A LOT of people who want “more hardcore DnD but not insta-death, stats-don’t-matter randomness of OSR games”.

# Forbidden Lands

# Publisher: Free League Publishing

**REASONS YOU MAY LIKE IT:**

**Reason #1**

***The setting is a big, immersive sandbox of explorable lore***

Using the default setting is great because of how much history and lore is packed into it. The history of the world is fleshed-out, and throughout the game you’ll find ruins, artifacts and people that give little pieces to what happened before characters arrived. Even the monsters have lore discoveries if players can roll for it or ask the right NPCs.

This is the most “oooh”s and “aaahhh!”s I’ve ever had from players regarding lore in a campaign. The utter satisfaction of getting to say “oh King Doopty-Doo whose zombie you fought in session 2? This his castle” and hearing players go “Oh my god so that means this is his daughter!” is immensely satisfying.

It never has the random kitchen-sink feeling of DnD lore where you succeed a check and hear “The cultists hear worship Orcus!” and it doesn’t matter because the rest of the campaign has nothing to do with that random lore tidbit. It feels very alive and actually satisfying to learn along the way.You know how Elden Ring and Dark Souls give little pieces of the world lore with every item you find in the game? Forbidden Lands has a similar element.

&#x200B;

**Reason #2**

***Old-school brutality with modern progression and survivability***

Because of the dice pool “more damage means less dice for you” system, the game feels very brutal and every bit of damage matters. However, actually killing player characters takes some very unlucky rolls or extremely dangerous situations.

There is the POSSIBILITY of insta-death, but it takes a unlucky rolls for that to happen. Instead of insta-dying like in Borg games, or GUARANTEED eventual-destruction like Blades in the Dark, your characters will usually accrue wounds and physical debilitations (like Kingdom Death: Monster but less often and less devastating) such as a severed limb, or internal damage, that will impact their character but keep them alive. This is a game where players will very often search for any way they can avoid direct combat if they can help it.

If your character survives long enough, you will enjoy level ups and abilities that make them feel decently powerful, and experience actual progression and growth of your character’s abilities.

&#x200B;

**Reason #3**

***SO MANY TABLES!! So much VARIETY***

The game provides tons of random events and tables to roll from for just about every mechanics in the game; it makes everything feel fresh and varied. The story events you experience while traveling are really weird and unique and fun; they may flesh out the lore of the world, or present your characters a new possible side adventure, or introduce a new rival or ally.

Even hunting is done from a table for what kind of animal you find and mishaps occur along the way. Setting up camp can go wrong; you may accidentally walk through a bramble bush that tatters your clothes, or a rogue campfire can burn half the camp down.

If your characters establish a stronghold there’s so many events that can occur: maybe it has a leaky roof or a flock of Harpies inhabiting it when you find it. Rogue bandits or a king’s forces can stumble across it and declare its theirs. A bear can move in while nobody is there. Maybe your hirelings are tired of the terrible pay and simply leave.

It’s as exciting for the GM as it is for the players to find out what’s gonna happen when you enter any place.

&#x200B;

**Reason #4:**

***Immersive gameplay mechanics***

I really feel like it’s worth expressing just how immersive the gameplay feels.

Even when I started playing RPGs, it’s always been weird to me that a DnD character takes a sword in their stomach or an arrow in their shoulder and it doesn’t hinder them at all until they hit 0 HP. In this game, a broken glass bottle can debilitate you enough to make combat feel difficult.

Your characters actually feel hindered by harm, they feel exhausted after traveling without a break for days. It creates new roleplay situations and strategic decision-making for every encounter and travel scenarios.

“If we stop to rest tonight, we may not make it to the town healer in time to cure this poison in my blood; but if we push through and march for two days, we may collapse frome exhaustion.” This is an actual scenario that happened in our game (he collapsed from exhaustion and they had to carry him to the town; he was cured on the last day remaining before he died).

You can’t depend on coin-toss luck in a fight if all your characters are at half-strength; just like real life, it’s unlikely you’ll succeed if you’re all bleeding to death and a group of armed, well-rested enemies comes at you.

&#x200B;

**Reason #5:**

***Immersive survival mechanics that aren’t a burden or bookkeeping***

Your day is tracked in 4 quarters, and each quarter every character decides what theyre doing.Will you all hike another hex space, will you stop to make camp or hunt for food or search for a source of water to fill up? Will you craft more arrows or repair your gear damaged in the last fight? Every character decides what they contribute, so someone is always doing something for the party.Instead of tracking each individual resource in your inventory sheet, it’s all simplified for quick reference and access.

Resource dice are awesome; instead of tracking “okay I have 12 food units which can last us 3 days”, you simply roll your resource die to see if you have less food than you did before you ate. It abstracts “how much water do we have” instead of needing to use units of measurement that you’re constantly erasing.

Your characters need a warm, safe place to camp at night or they may be freezing through the night or ambushed by wandering enemies. You need to sleep, eat and drink every day because its debilitating to be tired, hungry or dehydrated.

The terrain you’re in, the weather and the time of day affect how these survival actions go but it’s all handled very quickly and simply with tables and easy modifiers, so it goes by fast when you want it to, and lasts a second when you want to roleplay or check your party’s condition.

&#x200B;

**Reason #6:**

***VERY friendly for on-the-fly GMing and GMs who don't like prep***

I edited this to mention something another commenter pointed out:

all the tables and random events mean there's a lot of sporadic adventure potential that takes no GM prep whatsoever.

My players have gotten distracted trying to find a home for a baby they found in the woods, exploring a town with a secret cult (that was randomly rolled for in the Adventure Site Generator), and even trying to settle down a tavern they established in a town.

In theory you could run a campaign without any overarching plot, and just having players explore dungeons/towns and looting treasures they find, because every adventure site and artifact has potential lore and adventure behind it.

&#x200B;

**Reason #7:**

***Monsters aren’t just damage sponges and actually have unique conditions***

Almost every monster has a table of special abilities to roll from that can alter the battle drastically. They also all have either a special weakness or condition that’s able to be manipulated:

you can try to hit between the monster’s missing scales (Smaug-style) to lower its armor. Another monster will continuously attack whoever is wearing the shiniest equipment. Another monster will be extremely weakened if you manage to cut off its tail first. Another monster has less attacks-per-turn if you cut off one of its arms.

You get the point.

Monster fights feel climactic, epic and scary. Their special ways they harm the player aren’t the only interesting thing about them; how they INTERACT with the battle and the battlefield adds a fun layer to their encounters.

&#x200B;

**Reasons you MAY NOT like this game:**

**Reason #1:**

***Direct combat can be slow***

If you get in a large scale fight, there’s always the possibility of it taking as long as a DnD or Pathfinder fight can.

It simplifies everything so there’s not that many modifiers or if-else conditionals, and it’s cool that hit success and damage is all calculated by one roll, but if an enemy has armor or youre using arrows it can feel a little clunky. Your non-combat characters (such as druid or Peddler) may not have as much to contribute to a fight besides “I hit them with my stick” which leaves them on the sidelines a little bit if things get very heavy.

There’s a chance combat will be quick and brutal, and end in a couple rounds, but there’s also a chance you’ll all just turn into the DnD Fighter class and continuously roll to attack every turn until someone falls down.

**Reason #2:**

***Messy Rulebook***

I don’t know WHY it’s so difficult for publishers to put ALL THE COMBAT-RELATED RULES IN ONE PLACE.Armor values, drowning rules, movement and actions, ranged attacks, prone attacks are all in far-apart pages/chapters and it means a lot of frantic flipping through pages while your players wait for a ruling. I had to keep my own personal Index page to quick-access all the most commonly-used rules.

&#x200B;

**Reason #3:**

***Magic doesn’t have a great risk-reward ratio***

Magic in the setting is extremely chaotic and dangerous to use;  basically everyone who uses magic in this setting is a DnD wild-mage.

Unfortunately, the level of danger doesn’t scale with the level of usefulness. Whether you’re using something simple like speak with animals or something destructive like fireball, there’s a chance your character can roll badly and severely wound/hinder/KILL themselves.

It would have been much better if the level of threat from magic matched the level of power of the magic being used instead of “use ANY spell and you might destroy yourself”. My magic users used spells as rarely as possible, which felt kind of lame; it felt like they were being punished for their class choice. Next time I run Forbidden Lands I’ll probably homebrew something to make it SLIGHTLY less devastating.

&#x200B;

**Reason #4:**

***Definitely not a “tactical” game***

It has tactical situations, but if you want grid-based, minmax, strategy game scenarios you may be disappointed.

The combat is more strategic than most Free League games, but it still prioritizes narrative and realistic brutality over video-gaminess.

&#x200B;

**Reason #5:**

***The cool discoverable lore is difficult to work with without a published campaign***

In fact, all of the provided lore in the Game Master Guide relates to the published “Raven’s Purge” campaign. If you want to use the setting yourself, it’s going to take a lot of writing and GM prep to prepare an epic campaign with discoverable lore.

The mechanics still work great by themselves, but a big portion of the game’s fun is discovering the world lore as you travel, so without the published campaign to provide context you have to make a lot of stuff up and have your own reasoning for why things are the way they are.

Basically, if you want to run a campaign with this game without a published adventure, I hope you’re into worldbuilding.

**CONCLUSION:**

I adore this game.

It’s one of my top 3 favorite games of all time, and the campaign that spanned a year holds a very special place in my heart. My players had a great time, I had an amazing time, and the story was so epic and classic and cool.Players are encouraged to be bandits and thieves if they desire, or a ragtag band of heroes that saves the world. Either way, it continues Free League’s tradition of “you’re regular people in extraordinary circumstances”.

The vibe is awesome, the gameplay is so much fun, and this is my go-to game when people ask for survival mechanics or low-magic fantasy realism.I can’t recommend this game enough.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2cdacb560>,rpg,1712255301.0
1guschs,What are your biggest pet peeves in the hobby ,"I hate when people think d&d is the only game in the hobby, I even knew someone who would call every TTrpg d&d I ironically 

I also hate when players create their characters with out a gm present, since they can incorporate elements to the story and easily help with the creation with out the players having to go through assumptions 

Also, fucking DLC business model. One of the reasons why I hate V5 is that, in order to have access to all the clans I gotta buy multiple books. In good old day you had one book, 13 clans. Perfect, everything else was to expand the lore from the core book. Now it feels like the company wants you to buy multiple bs and make you waste your time and money on purpose

1i4042g,Why are Moves not Skills?,"# So, you want to know what a PBTA Move is

In a [recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1i3wcgi/what_are_some_elements_of_ttrpgs_like_mechanics/) we saw a tussle about whether Moves are just Skills in a fancy wrapper. There were a lot of explanations being traded, but Moves can still be hard to grok.

## What is a Skill? A Move?
A **Skill** is: 

* A score which gives a bonus to a dice roll 
* When a character attempts a specific action
* Where the result of the roll determines whether the character succeeds or fails
* Where the bonus measures the ability of a character to perform a certain action

You don't need these examples of Skills, but:

* Lockpicking
* Marksmanship
* Bartering

A **Move** is:

* Step-by-step instructions or procedure
* That tells players what to do at certain times
* Which may or may not include rolling dice

That sounds a bit general, doesn't it? Examples of Moves are:

* Profess Your Love
* Act Under Pressure
* Lash Out

## A Venn diagram
The Venn diagram would look like:

* A Skill could be a Move
* But Moves are not just Skills
* A Long Rest could be a Move
* Even ending a session could be a Move

If you wrote the Lockpicking Skill like a Move, it would look like:

> **Break & Enter:** When you *try to get where you're not supposed to be*, roll +Smart.
> 
> * On a 10+, you're in and no-one is the wiser
> * On a 7-9, you're in, but you did it loudly, slowly, or broke something
> * On a 1-6, it won't budge and they're after you, get out of here!

## Hold on, that's very different
Can you kill the skeleton with your sword? That's what rules decide in a traditional RPG. But Moves solve the problem where you want to:

* Codify (turn into rules) ""the story"" (tropes, archetypes, cliches)
* Making the story something players can interact with using rules

This means that, similar to how players understand the possible outcomes when they attempt to hit the skeleton with your sword (making it fair and consistent), players also understand the possible outcomes when they lash out emotionally at their ex-husband. 

Moves are about **codifying storytelling** and **making it accessible**.

## Let's go back to Long Rests
This means if a game with Moves has a ""Long Rest"" move, it might not just be, if you rest for X hours, you regain Z hitpoints, but also: 

* Trading secrets
* Training
* Brooding
* Hearts to hearts

## Fiction first
Because Moves turn the story into rules, they are very strict about the 4th wall. Never say ""I Act Under Fire"", say, ""I run straight through the gunfire"".

This helps because which Move corresponds to which action depends on **intent**. If you're running through gunfire to save your loved one, it might be ""Prove Your Love"" instead. You're not using your Run Through Gunfire skill. You're performing a specific action within the story, and running through gunfire could be...

* Cowardly
* Heroic
* Romantic

Moves focus on the story behind the things you do

## Other characteristics of Moves
Moves usually have:

* Triggers, phrased like:

> When you X, Z.

* No binary success/failure, because just plain failure is boring

> When you X, roll Z. On a result of:
> 
> * A strong hit (10+), [spectacular success]
> * On a weak hit (7-9), [mixed success]
> * On a miss, (6 or less), [opportunity for the Game Master]

* Explicit consequences for failure

> On a mixed success, you convince them, but:
> 
> * They want an assurance from you now
> * You hurt someone close to you
> * You have to be honest with them

* Rules that require the Game Master to give you information 

> On a strong success, ask the Game Master two of the below:
> 
> * What happened here?
> * What sort of creature is it?
> * What can it do?
> * What can hurt it?
> * Where did it go?
> * What was it going to do?
> * What is being concealed here?
>
> They have to be honest with you.

* Interactions with not just NPCs, but other players (often sexual!)

> When you have sex:
> 
> * They get +1 XP but must be honest with you
> * You get +1 History forward

* Rules for incrementing clocks and resources
* Rules that interlink with other Moves
* Rules that constrain the Game Master (they're not a god, just a player)

## So, why not Skills?
If you had a game like *Pasion de la Pasions*, a telenova about dramatic families having sex with each other, have Skills like +10 Yelling where a successful roll would take -5 Hit Points... the game wouldn't make much sense. Instead, you have Moves like this one:

> When you flash back to reveal a shocking truth about another PC, mark a condition and roll with conditions marked. On a hit, the news is staggering; before acting against you, they must act with desperation. On a 7-9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2:
> 
> * You have unequivocal evidence this is true.
> * The shocking truth gives you rightful claim to
something they value.
> * You introduce a shocking new character who has
your back.
> * On a miss, it blows up in your face--hard. The GM
will tell you how.

## Pros and cons of Moves
Moves:

* Make it easy for everyone to engage with the story
* Help make storytelling more consistent, not just up to having a great GM
* Make it possible to play genre fiction games! How else could you do telenovas?

But they also:

* Can feel formulaic or prescriptive 
* Can feel confusing if you've only ever played traditional RPGs

(Moves should inspire creativity rather than restricting it, but anyway!)

1cq8sgt,Why do Game Masters on here view 5E as very taxing? Genuine question from another GM.,"Hey everyone. I know the question as is might seem rude. But as someone who has GMed 5E for the past 10 years (on and off with breaks) and has run other games as well although for certain not as long (primarily Lancer) I don't really understand the sentiment that 5E is heavily taxing for GMs. Maybes its just because it's been such a long time since I really had to think about it. Everything for me feels very automated at this point. I have all these tools and resources I am familiar with that make the process very light for me/ enjoyable regardless of effort. I tend to personally prep for 3-5 hours for each session. This usually provides enough for 2-3 sessions depending on how fast the group is going which often even allows me to not need to prep at all. If anything it can feel like a lot more effort is needed for new games but I tend to not view that too negatively. Learning a new set of rules, finding a new set of tools for GMing etc can be its own reward and adventure. with the added bonus that you get to interact with that community a lot (shout-out to the Lancer Discord server for always being so friendly and patient!). 

But yeah I am primarily interested in hearing your reasoning for it! I might of understood the sentiment back in 2014 when it initially released but I didn't know any better back then since 5E was my first time GMing something.

1cunix6,Non-DnD Games for DnD obsessed kids,"Odd title, but hear me out.

I run a weekly 5e campaign for a group of elementary school kids through my local library's after-school program. 

These kids make my regular group of murder hobos look sane and well-adjusted. They threw an orphan down a bottomless well for funsies. They got access to a Demon Grinder War Machine, painted it with polka dots, and named it the Love Machine of Death. They created Power Word: Divorce and have used it, multiple times. 

It's honestly become the highlight of my week and I can't recommend it enough.

I've since agreed to run some explicitly not-DnD games to give them a taste of other systems and expand their horizons. 3 different games, 2 sessions each, 3hrs per session, with a max of 5 players.

Now obviously the adventures will be censored and de-violenced to a kid-appropriate level. I'm just interested in showing them systems that are different enough from DnD (and 5e specifically).

The shortlist currently includes:  
-Mausritter  
-Pirate Borg  
-Kids on Brooms  
-Mythic Bastionland  
-FIST  
-Trophy Gold  
-Mothership

So, please give me your not-DnD suggestions. Do it for the kids!

1izt4c7,I really hope Draw Steel makes a lot more systems use autohit combat,"i got to play the initial oneshot they released for the draw steel playtests, and i had a million complaints and things i hated about it. all of those were eclipsed by how much more *fun* it was to actually play than all of the fantasy systems i was in campaigns of at the time. every time i'm in a game where someone misses an attack, i immediately think ""i could be playing draw steel instead"".

this post isn't really about draw steel. most of the time i'd rather play other games; the big-damn-heroes epic fantasy isn't really my thing, i don't like the tone it's written in, etc etc. but any kind of vaguely d&d-shaped game is *so much more fun* when you don't have a random chance to miss every attack. i can't stand to-hit rolls anymore. they have upsides, there's plenty of perfectly valid reasons to like them, but none of those reasons come even close to making up for how much of a slog combat becomes when you have all these unnecessary random chances to waste your turn. not just waste your action in a fight, but waste everyone's real-life time.

and every time i see whatever's the hot new D&D-ish RPG picking up steam, i get interested until i see they're just using to-hit rolls again. shadowdark and dragonbane sure look cool, but i know if i played them i'd have to put up with random wasted turns and it just kills my enthusiasm. so i'm just really hoping once draw steel finishes development and gets into people's hands, more designers jump on the autohit train so i can start being excited about new RPGs again.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ce1e1bb0>,rpg,1740697269.0

1hkaid5,Another post about making physical copies of your legally purchased PDFs,"## I Had Some Time To Kill Today

One of the games in regular rotation by my group is Mongoose Traveller 2E. And there a 2 great Bundles of Holding now for Mongoose Traveller.

Another sale that happened this month was a wire binding machine on sale on Amazon for $50.00.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DH27MLXK

So, I bought the machine, printed out the PDF and got to binding.

## Here Is The Finishesd Product

## Some Details On What You're Seeing Here

The pages are printed on standard US Letter 20 lb. Paper. The reason why the pages are not flat is because I used my laser printer to print these, a Brother HL-3170CDW.  It has a pretty short paper paper, so pages tend to curl. It's not very noticable when you print a few pages. But it's noticable, when you print a big stack of pages.

I like the cover to be a little rigid and protected.  So, for the covers, I glued the pages to magazine backer boards used by comic collectors and then wrapped the front and back in contact paper.

## Notes about Wire Binding

The machine I bought is a wire binding, sometimes called a wire-o-binding, machine. The machines come in 2 different pitch sizes: 3:1 and 2:1. 3:1 will only let you bind 120-130 sheets (240-260 pages). If you want to bind larger than that, you need to use 2:1. The machine I bought only does 3:1, which has a maximum wire diameter of 9/16"".

They make combo machines that can do both 3:1 and 2:1, but those gets pretty pricey.

Wire binding has the advantage of lying completely flat and you can also fold it back 180 degress.  Spiral/Coil binding does the smae thing. But with Wire binding, when you fold it back, the folded back pages line up with the pages that are not folded back. With wire/coil binding they're shift up a little.

Amd wire binding is, as expected by the name, made of metal.  It's pretty stiff metal, but if it gets bent, you will not easily bend it back. You're going to be undoing the binding and rebinding it.

## Notes About The Specific Wire Binding Machine

The machine comes with a big box of ⅜"" wires to you started. These are A4 paper, which is what the entire planet besides North America uses. You'll need to use some wire cutters to cut the thing shorter for US Letter-size pages.

1gqz1o2,"Well, I suddenly ran Dragonbane.","You might remember me from such threads as ""Who and What is Dragonbane for?""

Well, tonight my group was expecting to continue into our fourth session of a GMless Ironsworn: Starforged campaign, but one of our players never made it. We assume he was sleeping, as he is insane and wakes up at 4am to play with us every week. It's a wonder this is the first time he didn't show up to a session.

So, with everybody sitting around at gametime wondering what we're going to do, I suggest we each throw a game into a pile and roll a d100. Highest roll runs a game. I had just re-read a quarter of the rules for Dragonbane due to the thread I made yesterday, so I obviously felt completely comfortable running the game with no warning.

Luckily, I rolled a 31 on the D100, so somebody else is going to be running the game tonight. Second player rolled a 21. Alright. Third player didn't have a game ready to run (we're not all going to learn Flying Circus right the fuck now). Last player rolls a 29. I ask if he accidentally rolled a d20 instead.

Nope.

Well, that settles it then, I'm suddenly running Dragonbane with my roll of 31. Thankfully, I purchased the core rulebook module for FoundryVTT when Free League was having a sale ~6 months ago.

Now, the adrenaline starts kicking in a little bit. I have to run a game I read 70% of the rules of a year ago, with no prep, and never having read any adventure for it. The other three start skimming the rules, and I decide it's a better use of my time to pre-read a bit of the adventure in the back of the core book instead of trying to refresh myself on the rules for 5 minutes.

Honestly, it probably would have been better for me to refresh myself on the rules. Not because I needed to, or any big mistakes were made rules-wise, but because the adventure was dead simple to run with entirely new eyes. Good stuff, if not a bit bland.

So how did it go?

Well, the heavily armoured and entirely cocksure Mallard walked right into a trap on the party's way up to the fort where the adventure primarily resides. And, wouldn't you know it, the trap didn't do enough damage to get past his armour. What better way to turn confidence into overconfidence? He proceeded to accidentally run into, and activate, every trap possible.

The Mallard activated the alarm bells for the fort, and the ambush of 6 Goblins was very quickly put down by the martial abilities of the Wolfkin.

After they thoroughly explored the fort, tied the goblin leader to a tree, made friends with the Orc and her hog, and were on their way out with a couple pocketfuls of treasure, the final boss appeared. The nearly-translucent form of a ghostly armoured knight, mounted on horseback, blocking their exit. 

The mallard, wearing the helmet of this old wights slayer in ancient times (because of course), immediately drew attention and ire. And at the same time, he felt the skull he had retrieved from the bottom of the well shift in his bag, looking through him toward the undead.

The Archmaster, behind the Mallard and the Wolfkin, attempted to cast a fireball at the ghost, rolled a demon, and took just enough damage to knock himself out, as he lost control of his power. The Wolfkin attacked ferociously, but couldn't get through the armour of the ghastly knight.

The Mallard took out from his pack the skull he found in the bottom of the well, launched it into the air, and struck it with his battleaxe. The skull exploded; dead dust propelled onto the rider himself.

While this act will destroy the rider soon, the ghost is pissed and goes at him with everything it has before it turns to dust. The rider uses its undead powers to freeze the Mallard in place right before its ghostly form faded to nothingness. Well, that puts things right, right? Well, with the undead now dead, the castle everyone is standing (or dying) in begins to tremble and shake mightily; collapsing around them.

The Wolfkin rushes to pick up the frail wizard and carry him out, but takes just enough damage to go down beside the duck. The duck, having been frozen in place by the undead spell, finally succeeds at the check to break free. He's at a single point of HP from the collapse of the castle around him. He makes the strength check to grab and start dragging both his companions. But rolls a Demon on his acrobatics check to make it over the now-destroyed bridge leading out of the fort.

All the players die. The adventure ends with the two NPC party members, who had made it clear they were going to compeltely waste their share of the treasure, thinking about how all the treasure was still on the bodies of the people a castle just crashed down on.

The game was fun, it was easy to run with zero prep, it was very quick to teach, and it performed admirably in an old-school mini-adventure. There was little rules-confusion, it was easy to find answers quickly by looking where the info should be in the pdf, and the couple things we didn't want to break the pacing to find were easy to improvise. Everybody had a good time. It matched up perfectly to the common sentiment in the last thread.

Am I ever going to play it again? I don't honestly know. There wasn't much exciting about the system. I've only played ~10 out of the 25+ other rules-lite, low prep, OSR-adjascent fantasy games I own. But maybe the next one of those games I reach for will feel worse than Dragonbane, or get in my way somehow. If it does, I could very well see a future where I think back to this session fondly.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ce20cc20>,rpg,1731567070.0
1cwm6ek,Companies that support brick-and-mortar stores by providing PDFs when you provide proof of purchase,"Hello, just wanted to give a shout out to Dire Wolf Games for providing me with a PDF after I purchased a print copy of the Cortex Prime RPG.

After having gone through a similar process with Fate of Cthulhu and Savage Worlds, I thought it'd be nice for potential buyers to know which companies support brick-and-mortar stores by providing PDF copies to go along with your physical purchase. So far in my firsthand experience I have:

* Dire Wolf Games (Cortex Prime)
* Pinnacle (Savage Worlds)
* Evil Hat Productions (Fate, Blades in the Dark, Thirsty Sword Lesbians)

Any others to add to the list? Specifically looking for those that provide a digital copy after you buy the physical. It's not uncommon for companies to sell both together, but that doesn't help a gaming store out.

Edit: Thanks to those who recommended [https://www.bits-and-mortar.com/](https://www.bits-and-mortar.com/) for this. I saw that Dire Wolf and Pinnacle weren't on there, so I sent that link to them to decide on. So I guess I'd really like to see suggestions for companies not already on this list. Great list so far.

1ilpoif,RPG related projects on Kickstarter in 2024 - a report,"My final report for the year 2024 on Kickstarter for RPGs can be found on RPGGeek here:

[https://rpggeek.com/geeklist/280234/rpg-kickstarter-geeklist-tracking?itemid=10360304#10360304](https://rpggeek.com/geeklist/280234/rpg-kickstarter-geeklist-tracking?itemid=10360304#10360304)

Key points:

\* 2024 saw the greatest number of projects ever (1892), beating the previous record in 2023 (1754)  
\* 2024 had the 2nd largest funding total ever (US$64M), beating last year (US$59M) but not the record in 2021 (US$84M)  
\* However, this total is somewhat misleading as 23% arises from a single project: the Cosmere RPG (US$15M). Without that project the total would have been lower than in both 2022 and 2023.  
\* The number of 5E related projects continued to increase (796 this year versus 656 last year). However, the value of 5E projects plummeted (US$19M this year versus US$30M last year).  
\* The large decrease in 5E funding compared to the increase in 5E projects can be partially explained by the large number of what could be described as ""dollar store"" projects placed on Kickstarter last year. 50% of 5E projects last year had a funding goal of <=US$500, compared to: 2023 41%, 2022 28%, 2021 18%. Anecdotally, these projects very often include AI-generated art and are of the ""100 X to add to your game"" type, or small adventures/modules. These projects do fund; 86% of 5E projects funded this year compared to 87% in 2023 and 84% in 2022, so it is unlikely they will go away any time soon.

1hoj914,Is it wrong to “pull rank” as a GM?,"A bit of context, I have been friends with everyone at my table for very long. We are chill, and we communicate our issues with each other like adults.

I am the Default GM at our table. Occasionally, someone else might volunteer to take the seat for a oneshot or mini campaign, but if I don’t set up a session, we might spend 2-3 months without meeting. Though we started by playing D&D, over the years I have moved away from the system, tried out a few others, and eventually settled in one that allowed me to tell the stories I wanted to. 

About half of the table still really likes D&D, and though I used to sprinkle one here and there, but after they recently asked for one I finally decided to say “look, if you manage to get someone to run D&D for that day, I’ll give them the slot, but I am not.” Of course, nobody wanted to run anything on short notice, and they mentioned that they are a bit burned out from my campaign, so the session got effectively cancelled. 

I know I can run/not run whatever I want, but I don’t want to unilaterally kill our regular hangouts (I have little trust of one of them running D&D regularly) so I’m mostly wondering if there was any alternatives I’m missing, or if I was wrong to give an ultimatum like that.

While some of the features sound nice every time I try them they feel like they add so much bloat and end up dragging the game down rather than adding to it. 

When I played in a group a friend ran there were so many sessions that ground to a halt because of tech issues or people not being able to find the thing they need or whatever.

1hnycm8,Why can't I GM sci Fi?,"I've been my groups forever GM for 30+ years. I've run games in every conceivable setting. High and low fantasy, horror, old West, steam punk, cyberpunk, and in and on and on. 

I'm due to run our first Mothership game in a couple of days and I am just so stuck! This happens every time I try to run sci fi. I've run Alien and Scum & Villainy, but I've never been satisfied with my performance and I couldn't keep momentum for an actual campaign with either of them. For some weird reason I just can't seem to come up with sci fi plots. The techno-speak constantly feels forced and weird. Space just feels so vast and endless that I'm overwhelmed and I lock up. Even when the scenario is constrained to a single ship or base, it's like the endless potential of space just crowds out everything else. 

I'm seriously to the point of throwing in the towel. I've been trying to come up with a Mothership one shot for three weeks and I've got nothing. I hate to give up; one of my players bought the game and gifted it to me and he's so excited to play it. 

I like sci fi entertainment. I've got nothing against the genre. I honestly think it's just too big and I've got a mental block. 

Maybe I just need to fall back on pre written adventures.

In practice this has been tough! Even after moving from games like 5e and Pathfinder into simpler prep stuff in the OSR space and then only prepping exactly what I'm gonna need for the immediate next session... It's still not fast enough! Reading a short published adventure,  using a highlighter or re-write read-aloud text, writing notes and updating it to fit in your campaign is the minimum you'll need.

Putting it into a VTT will require you extracting and resizing maps, pre-creating NPCs, setting the dynamic lightning, adding the artwork for monsters etc.
