1i7fiuq,"As of now, no Twitter (""X"") links are allowed on /r/osr.","Hi folks,

Not that there ever were a lot, but as of now, any Twitter (""X"") links are banned here on /r/osr. This counts both for posts and comments. I said originally not to call anyone a Nazi unless they literally had Swastika tattoos, but doing a Nazi salute, twice, in public, then trying to convince people to doubt the evidence of their own senses, is at least the equivalent of that.

This is not censorship. This is editorial control. If you want to create your own subreddit, maybe /r/gaslighting (does that already exist?) or /r/nazisarentreallynazis, you are free to do so, and I won't/can't stand in your way.

If you complain that /r/osr has gone ""woke"", or ever use that term in a non-ironic way, I feel sorry for you. It must be exhausting trying to find immigrants, or people with different skin tones, or folks with alternate sexual identities, to blame the consequences of your own poor life decisions on. And trying to defend it as a ""Roman salute"" or whatnot is just sad.

Penalty for posting a Twitter/X link is an instant ban. We'll have to think about for how long, but I'm thinking at least a week. Penalty for trying to subvert by posting an image of such a post or some other circuitous trick will result in a permanent ban.

regards,

the /r/osr mod team, and me, /u/amp108, personally.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16cae89b0>,osr,1737564380.0

Hey all, first post in this sub. So recently I got into dnd and spoke with my dad about running a campaign. He was telling me about the old days and how he thinks all his dnd stuff is kicking around somewhere. After a bit rummaging, we found it. I think it's so cool looking back at all of this old stuff and comparing what it was like to play back then to 5e. This is now my most prized possession and I shall cherish it forever.

157om2t,Dark Sun OSE Revamped,"
Greetings everybody! 
I am hereby to share my revamped versions of the Dark Sun OSE conversion that I shared a while back. With these new revisions, I went through all the books and reorganized them in 2, the Player's Handbook and Game Master's Guide, making some clear revisions:
 
1- I added new covers, made by the awesome gentleman Alexandre Henriques, with the important disclaimers that these booklets are only for free distribution and not official in any kind (They are and shall always be free)

2- Made some corrections for typos and other formatting issues that I wasn't able to notice initially.

3- The books are now in A5 format, rather than A4, meaning that this conversion now is set into the OSE format.

4- Minimum additions for the player's handbook, as it includes both the genre rules and psionic and magic booklets combined into one!

5- Major additions for the Game Master's Guide, I included 27 New Magical Items from the Dark Sun setting (Adding to a total of 30) and a Wilderness Feature Generator. Now you can randomly generate natural formations from different categories and combinations, from vegetation, hydrography, relief and many more,  randomly rolled depending on the region of the wilderness you find yourself in.

Once again, thank you for all the support, these additions have made these project all the more exciting personally, and I hope you can use them at your table!

17fjy02,"Alexander Macris, the creator of Adventurer Conqueror King, is an active figure in the American alt-right movement. There are enough good B/X clones that one could buy without financially supporting the promotion of a hateful ideology.","I would have made this a reply to his kickstarter post but he has pre-emptively blocked users that were critical of him on this subreddit in order to keep the post as sycophantic as possible.

There's been an organized effort coordinated from the official Autarch discord server to jump on any comments in /r/osr that point this out, as well as to signal boost ACKS 2E prior to the kickstarter launch. The kickstarter post now on the front page was surely also shared there with the intent to generate early, non-endemic momentum. This behaviour is in violation of reddit's site-wide rules and in my opinion would warrant banning any and all Autarch/Arbiter of Worlds content from being promoted on this subreddit, a response many other subreddits have found effective against persistent brigading. This would have the added benefit of reducing the amount of transphobia and antisemitism on /r/osr, as those sentiments seem to inevitably pop up in comment chains about ACKS despite fans' insistence that the game has nothing to do with the politics of its creator.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x175cd2420>,osr,1698172836.0
1hcqil2,Playing Dungeon Crawl Classics with my daughters.,"To be real I've read DCC, even watched some videos but never really sat down to play a game through the first one shot. Asked my girls if they were up for a game, and they said sure!

Got to rolling some characters, 3d6 DTL. Got a human fighter, human cleric of Cthulhu, and a halfling. 

Did a one shot where the temple that the cleric worshipped at was raided by pirate orcs stealing an important artifact. Got the other two mixed in to join by being the hired help to accompany the Cleric.

Approaching the hide out by following the coast line. The hideout located on a cliff face was guarded by a lone orc.

Waiting till nightfall they saw the orcs leave on their ship, and approached it under cover of darkness. They decided to return back to a village they passed up a ways that was also suffering from the orcs.

hrui7u,"Announcement: starting now, there will be a ban on promoting any Zak S content.","Folks,

The circumstances which led me to ban Zak Smith/Zak Sabbath/Zak S from this subreddit now impel me to enact a ban on mentioning his works. I had (perhaps naïvely) believed that a user ban would be enough, but it seems like he has enough sock puppet accounts or minions to keep his presence alive here, especially as he continues to produce new content. Therefore, posts promoting him or his products will be removed; repeat posters will be banned. Comments mentioning him will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but may be removed and might also result in a user ban.

To be clear: I do not know for a fact that the allegations of abuse against him are true, but they come from multiple sources, and to my knowledge not all of them have been refuted (lawsuits notwithstanding). Even if they had all been disproven, though, the toxic manner of interaction which he and others allied with him employ on other fora is not welcome here.

Also to be clear: this is not censorship. This is the exercise of editorial control. Anyone who is upset by this decision is free to post elsewhere, perhaps in a subreddit of their own making. I made this one, and wish to promote a healthier style of interaction between members.

I do not like taking this action. I don't like restricting discussion, and I don't like singling out one person for censure. But I believe, in the end, it will be best for this community, and if the allegations are true, it is the only respectful decision I can make for the women involved.

This post will be locked, as the decision is not up for discussion.

Be good people.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x175b8e960>,osr,1594842132.0

1i0ia9u,Rediscovering a love for “vanilla.”,"I, like many others, have a chronic worldbuilding problem. 

While super fun, and one of the things I enjoy most - a nice tea brew, a pipe, and some notebooks and pens are pretty much my comfort definition these days for my spare time - it also makes things challenging sometimes. 

My constant need to have things feel “unique” or “different” can lead to more building than playing sometimes, or getting stuck in endless loops of notes I’ll never use! 

To combat this, and just to have some fun on my own, I decided to take another run at  a few classic modules solo between my usual game sessions using B/X and keeping things largely vanilla. 

Not worrying about what’s over that ridge or developing the religion beyond “new gods feel like church, old gods feel like Celtic deities” and somehow not concerning myself with the primordial origins of how dwarves came to be nor the specific hierarchical split of all goblinkind…has been freeing. 

Sometimes it feels good to just huck the dice and have a party with a dwarf a wizard a fighter and a cleric in it with good ol basic fantasy names.

Kal-Arath is an old school 2d6 system designed for solo or group play - it leans heavily into its epic sword and sorcery roots and presents a gritty world rife with conflict, where fighting monks offer blood sacrifice to demon khans and horse lords war in giant wooden ships on the endless grasslands of Kal-Arath.

You can play as anything you like - the classless system relies on the choice of attributes and skills, rather than rigid classes; you might play a warrior with a demonic pact allowing him to cast powerful blood magic, or a thief turned fighter like Conan…

Whatever you choose, the second, follow up zine (also included in this Kickstarter) “Valley of the Black Ziggurat” will put your character to the test: a deadly new region to explore, as well as adding new tables to the core book’s region for expanded points of interest, encounters, monsters and much more.

113nmdm,Dear Mods and OSR Redditors,"Dear Mods and OSR Redditors 

I like this subreddit because it is the closest thing to the old G+ forum. 

On G+ people micro-blogged, people posted discussion topics, and people shared links to their blogs and crowd funding projects. 

All these activities were valued. 

In particular, sharing a blog post showed people something they may or may not have known about and/or liked. If the blog post was not your bag, you simply scrolled past. I never considered sharing a blog post to be “spamming”. That presupposes that the posters are selling that which the users do not want to see. I want to see these blog posts highlighted, to see new things. 

I like to see blog posts effectively rated by up/down votes, it throws light on interesting blog post that I might not have taken an interest in. 

I know there is a subset of redditors that hate blog posts, and only want to have discussions. But, **why are they the most important users on this subreddit?**  

Recently, there seems to be a trend on this subreddit to make this subreddit like all the boring subreddits where the mods are uber-controlling, to make this subreddit like all the other uptight subreddits. 

I don’t think blog post links should be ghettoed to a single thread (and we all know ghettoed threads are where things are sent to die), because some subredditors don’t like those kinds of post. It’s not like I have noticed an abusive amount of blog post. 

Please leave this subreddit as it has been for the last 8 or so years, there was nothing wrong with the permissive, embracive culture. Why mess with the winning formula? 

I guess I’m bringing this seeming change in policy to the fore, and the “we only like discussions posts” brigade will downvote this post hard.

They’re an ancient cult of druids/sorcerers who tried to summon their elder god of riot, ruin and vermin, but were “infested” by the god instead. 

Their bodies twisted into the verminous forms they revered and used in their foul rites and now for ages, they themselves have infested the rotting and grim places of the world. 

They are spreaders of plague, haunters of narrow mounds and summoners of vermin and other rat-men from the titanic, twisting and labyrinthine warren-like body of their rotting god. 

I have these in mind as powerful enemies, but with their Skaven-style minions as a major threat to any area, possibly also dominating goblin and other humanoid forces in a region. 

Really, just reskinning Skaven because why not - but I also don’t know much Warhammer lore and love ratmen.

And while she slumbers these last many years, the goblins have grown forgetful on the toadstools that proliferate the shores of the dark pond, and have lost the proper music to awaken her. 

Here, the towering teeth of malachite conceal the imprisoned Blind Seer, punished for ancient crimes to his former lord. 

In the center of this subterranean mycelial majesty is the towering form of the Great One, from whence spring all the other mushrooms, revered and worshiped by the Sporeherders. 

Blue light from glowing crystal clusters illuminates the rocky towers of Archfort - and the remains of what the goblins who guard it call the Man-Road. But why is it here at all? 

This, and many more secrets hidden lie here - and further still, bitter memories stalk the hall and chamber of the Courts of the Cold King. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x176319670>,osr,1732107931.0

I had done some basic worldbuilding stuff, just a few cultural overviews and setting the stage of law and chaos. 

Printed a Dyson map should they go into the dungeon. (They did.)

Winged a lot of the dungeon - these days as long as I have a good idea of what’s there I can lean pretty heavy on the map itself and wandering encounters for a fun delve. Lost one PC to an 8’ tall skeleton guarding the sarcophagus they were there to take a rubbing of for a magi in the city. 

A little hexcrawling on a rumor of wyverns netted (in an honest to god roll on a wandering monster table on the way to scout the wyverns) a fight with a red dragon - 

a smart use of the magic user casting darkness on an archer’s arrow after it struck the dragon led to the young dragons death, but its mature mate came into the battle soon after and roasted another PC and all their allies. 

Anyways thought I’d give folks a Quick Look - there were dungeons…AND dragons. Lots of fun and looking forward to a long campaign. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17705c860>,osr,1728733393.0

11l514k,OSR theory vs reality,"My background: Started playing D&D in 1979 with the Holmes blue box. Played regularly ever since. Witnessed the genesis and growth of the old-school renaissance movement on various forums since it started more than 15 years ago, and participated in many discussions about what made early D&D different from what came later.

And I’m here to tell you that dogma like ‘combat is a fail state in old-school D&D’ is revisionist nonsense. And the fact it gets bandied around so often is proof that the reality of how people played D&D 40 years ago has been eclipsed by theory-craft.

By the time AD&D was published, the great majority of gamers employed a mix of published and home-brew adventures. Adventures like Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, White Plume Mountain, Keep on the Borderlands, and Village of Hommlet flew off the shelves. None of these are mega-dungeons. None of them present a premise of sneaking into a dungeon and liberating it of treasure without alerting the inhabitants. In some cases, putting the inhabitants to the sword to remove a threat to civilization is the whole point of the adventure (G1, the Caves of Chaos). In others (White Plume, Hommlet, the Tower of Zenopus), the scope and layout of the dungeon does not enable the stealthy circumvention of threats.

No, when the party rolled up to the entrance of those dungeons, they were on a search a destroy missions to kill the monsters and take their stuff. Did they use deception and cunning tricks to shift the odds in their favour? Absolutely. Did they retreat from combat when they realized they were in over the heads? For sure. Did many PCs die out of bad play or bad luck? Yep.

But what they did not do is treat combat as a fail state. Rolling dice and killing monsters was the heart of the game, and the default premise of these hugely popular adventures - adventures that taught new players what D&D was about. How Gygax and a few other OGs played in 1975 was already irrelevant to the player-base by 1979. How would we have even known how Castle Greyhawk was run?

It’s cool that the OSR revived old and forgotten play modes and principles. I was part of that early dialogue, when we shared stories of desperate struggles to survive the Caverns of Thracia, or the six-level meatgrinder of a dungeon that our DM in grade 10 made over summer break. And how those experiences contrasted with the heroic, super-powered assumptions of 3.X D&D.

But the message has become garbled and distorted on forums like this, often by people who didn’t play 30+ years ago. Now they’re preaching and enforcing an orthodoxy that would have been absolutely baffling to a bunch of 15 year olds chucking dice in a rec room in the 80s.

Tldr: The OSR principles that get bandied on forums like this are not reflective of how the great majority of people played D&D in the first decade of its publication. They were crafted and championed with the aim of reviving a very narrow approach to play that was - until recently - not widely adopted or even known about.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1771a6f30>,osr,1678209088.0

woongi,Final Revisions to the Dark Sun OSE conversion,"How is it going everybody? I just completed the revisions to the whole OSE Dark Sun conversion. This is a series of improvements and restructuring and additions to all booklets to make the conversion more appealing to both players and DMs who want to play a Dark Sun Campaign.To begin with, the Conversion is separated in 4 Booklets: The Genre Rules (Previously called Character Creation), The Dungeon Master's Guide (Previously called Guide for DMs), The Monster Manual and a separate book for Psionic and Magic Rules. All Booklets in the conversion include printing guidelines for printing them in A5 format, their pdfs are bookmarked for ease for reference and all of them have some additions and changes, listed as follows:

* Genre Rules: This one has the least changes overall, I took out the psionics and magic rules and changed them for equipment, followers and stronghold rules, similar to its equivalent in the OSE Box Set.
* Dungeon Master's Guide: This one had the most additions. Basically I added more tools and tips for DMs for how to run a Dark Sun Game, with tips regarding tracking resources, and explanation to the Athasian Calendar, a series of potential adventure and campaign scenarios for inspiration and a lot of random tables, such as: Trinkets, Settlement Generation, City-State Generation, Dungeon Generation and more! I also moved here the appendix L: House Rules, previously present in the Character Creation Booklet, as it was honestly more fitting to be present here. I am also repeating the rules for equipment present in the genre rules, that way both DMs and Players are able to reference weapons and armor easily on the table.
* Monster Manual: This one didn't have much to add, but I added two monster, the Crystal Spyder and the Zhackal, present in the original monster compendium.
* Psionics & Magic: This one had some additions still in regards to methods for defiling (Like defiling while preparing spells rather than during casting) and Obsidian Orbs, a rather bold invention of mine, basically spell batteries that contain energy for spells combined with sith holocrons from Star Wars, I know, of Apocryphal within the Canon, but I couldn't help to add them because I thought they were so cool!

Now, some of you made the question as to when it would be safe to print the booklets, to which I finally say you guys can do it, as I won't be adding anything else to the conversion that I think is important to enjoy the setting to its fullest, or at least not in the foreseeable future. Rather, I'll slowly work in making the big tome that will have everything in just one book, but the only changes within it will be the referencing of pages, table of contents and bookmarking, so rest assured that your print out of this project will not be missing out of anything. I also made a Character Sheet! This is honestly not my strength,  I feel it's rather simplistic, but I still think it is functional and easy to use, I will not be sending it in PDF, rather I'll send it in PPT format, so you easily copy it and fill it with no issues if you are running a game online. Thank you so much for your support, this has been an amazing experience for me, I'll now take my time to start my own athasian campaign and start working on some other projects I am super excited about. Now is your turn, however go out and have the best games you can and enjoy all the excitement the ravaged world of Athas is capable to provide!

1h6cil4,A Long Overdue Thankyou to the Reddit OSR Community…,"Sorry it has taken so long to say, but Thankyou to all the members here who have done such a great job monitoring the art frauds who have been stealing my work and claiming it as their own. Part of the explanation this Thanks comes so belatedly is because I have been (luckily) busy drawing and painting. So this means I’ll be notified that I’ve been tagged in a post somewhere and it’s a person from this community who has taken the time to appreciate what I do, to remember it, and to my eternal gratification: eviscerate the imposter in the comments. I can only offer art in return, so here’s something I did for The Shrike by Leo Hunt and Joel Hines at Silverarm Press… 

It concerns a part of the game where a young girl and an old man live in a forest of tree sized candelabras, and she believes if she can light the limbs of each one she will be freed of her miserable situation… it’s a really tragic and touching part of the module, and I tried my best to depict her Sisyphean task… perhaps we can extend this to be analogous to the work of this community, trying to keep the lights on in an ever increasingly dim world….

Kelsey Dionne has not asked the mod team (nor has she paid us) to say this. She has been quietly responding to every allegation herself and Im embarrassed.

I’m embarrassed that our normally welcoming community has been hostile and abrasive to her creation; attributing her success to paying off talking heads for good reviews and not her hard work.

Ben Milton has been paid to review ShadowDark, he is the sole person who has been paid to review ShadowDark.

We should be celebrating the success of an OSR inspired game in hopes that it brings more traction to our niche corner of the hobby instead of acting like jealous children.

I don’t want to have to enforce this but conspiracy theorists will be looking at harsher punishments for future allegations.

1hsv5j3,The Highest Level of All,"Fantasy Wargaming is an oddity in my collection. Despite its title, it's not a wargame but an RPG.

About ten years ago, a fellow on a facebook Old School RPG sale page offered it for free, with the buyer paying postage. I had never heard of it before, was curious, so I took it off his hands.

I've flipped through it several times over the years, and read various sections, but this past holiday season, I decided give it a read-through and see if there was anything worth lifting for the OSR campaign I'm writing.

Strangely, Fantasy Wargaming is a novel-sized book rather than the usual oversized RPG publication. Somehow, that makes the rules more difficult to digest; I'm not sure why. There are very few illustrations, but lots and lots of charts and graphs.

The first 100 pages is lore and history; the author draws on various time periods and cultures. Next, is a long article about the fantasy works that inspired his vision: mainly Moorcock and Vance, but plenty of others.

After that, a long section on character creation (one of the photos is a sample character sheet), and a long section on gameplay. Finally, more info on the world.

There are a lot of good ideas here, but every idea sinks under cumbersome and/or too many rules. Creating a character alone might take an entire afternoon. Combat rules have almost too many variations, covering too many situations. Magic is similar. I almost wonder if anyone ever played this game, and if the game is playable at all!

They are not hardy, but their magic is unpredictable, powerful, and deadly. 

Guarding heavy door at ground level are a small group of corrupted horse lords. 

Within, thick incense obscures a huge chamber where three naked youths are chained to an altar ⛓️

If what the villagers told you is correct - There are 5 mystics chanting amid that acrid fog…

It was especially meaningful because her husband was really into D&D, and she didn’t want these minis just sitting around the house not being enjoyed by anyone.

Couple questions: 1) These are pure lead. Knowing what we know now, would people feel comfortable gaming with any pieces that I wash and fully paint? And 2) How fugging sick is that Deathdealer mini, huh?! I nearly lost it when I unearthed that one.

ws3rsc,Why you should splurge and get OSR print products,"You are possibly aware that a new version of 5e is dropping, called One D&D. They are eliminating the concept of an ""edition"" in favor of continuously updating rules, offering an online ecosystem of virtual tabletop services, and revising the core books. They're suggesting it's the last edition of D&D.

I know a lot of people here don't care about WotC D&D, but what I'm interested in thinking about is where WotC D&D is headed and what that means for TTRPG people who've opted out of their Great Reset.

To understand what's happening, it helps to look at academia. Publishers realized their biggest competition was the previous editions of their own books: Students would buy used copies, even of previous editions that were ""similar enough"". In order to make lots of filthy lucre, the publishers realized it wasn't enough to just change chapter titles and shuffle content around. Now they ""rent"" books and put content online behind subscription paywalls. Why? To limit competition. This is anti-competitive. It's about money. It's a way to force people to pay more for their products. Think Microsoft Office365.

Why is WotC doing what they're doing? They are embracing the ""product-as-a-service"" model and eliminating the competition from their own past book releases (as well as vertically integrating the whole online ttrpg experience to eat Roll20 et al's lunch). The point is that 5e is too big and well established to ""kill"" in one shot with a new 6e, so they have to move that massive player base to a new model while simultaneously making the existing 5e books obsolete. They are transitioning D&D to a model where there are no books or terrain or dice and everything is on your device. You get an account, you log in, everyone has their virtual table top open. There is nothing in meatspace. No dice, no pencils or paper, no books, no minis. You will be able to get the books for a few more cycles (7-10 years), and after that they will be ""deluxe slipcase"" editions for like $300 or a starter box set that is mostly about getting people acclimated to the online product. But no one will play D&D as an ""analog"" tabletop game anymore.

So once a sufficient number of people are plugged in to this new product, they'll quietly stop with the books. Why publish books? A $30-50 book sits on your shelf forever. The d&d service will be, whatever, $8-15 a month plus the texture packs and add-ons and supplementary content. That's more money a year than a copy of the PHB anyway, which you can resell (of course, most 5e players don't read it anyway, so what do they care if it gets taken away?). Enjoy renting your hobby, forever, you poor sucker.

Even if I'm wrong and WotC wants to keep a robust publishing business going in principle, the post-5e crowd is going to be functionally and mechanically illiterate because they will spend all their time relying on the app and the DM to offer their choice sets and resolve outcomes. Demand for the books will dry up, and WotC will be OK with that: Newspapers don't really want to print the things anymore, either, except at exorbitant rates.

You know the 3.5"" floppy icon that is used as the ""save"" symbol in lots of software, even though no one has used a floppy disk in decades? You're going to have a button that looks like a 20-sided die, you press it, and a random number occurs, and young people will be like, ""What is that funny looking icon?"" 

I am pointing this out to say, please buy print OSR products. First, the creators benefit from your support. But the ""OSR"" experience might increasing refer not just to the rules system or play experience but to the physical reality of the experience. Dice, pencils, paper, minis, humans looking at each other, books. A real shared experience that isn't a commercialized thing intermediated by WotC but a spontaneous and creative experience. Whether you use theater-of-the-mind or minis, that's about to vanish with D&D in the next 5 to 10 years, and D&D is like 90% of the ttrpg market.

If you own the book, no one can take it from you. No one can quietly change your digital copy because they don't like the mechanics or ideas. It's a piece of real art that you can appreciate in a world where everything is disposable and companies see it as their right to edit culture whenever it's profitable or convenient for them to do so.

In the future, digital things will die constantly. They will be even more disposable than the cheap plastic garbage that has flooded our lives and environment. D&D rules will become an ever-changing set of patch notes of nonsense. Competing products will rise up and die out and nothing will mark their coming or going, like so many dead digital worlds whose servers have been shut off forever.

But if you have the book, it was real. It happened. And it can happen again, just the way the author intended and the way you remember. You just need some dice and friends and imagination.

1d192xp,Just ran my first session of Keep on the Borderlands for an 8 player in person game using B/X.,"I made a d8 table of hooks or one sentence backstories for each character that wouldn’t make or break the campaign - just give them a decent reason to be there and work together. 

All opted to play fighters except one elf. 

I changed up quite a few things from the module as a few OGs at the table had run it before and I wanted to surprise them. 

Mine became more a story about the corrupt Curate working for the Master of a horrible and nameless cult, and a slaver conspiracy run by the Guild House in the keep. 

A few dumb moves by players got the elf killed in their first combat, so he immediately switched to playing one of the NPCs they’d hired and barely missed a round of fighting. 

Great time. It’s always a fun challenge running a table of that size for me and keeping things moving and organized.

10ueymv,Opinion: D&D Forgets It's Horror Roots,"Sword & Sorcery was often horror with swords.  The authors were contemporaries and friends of Lovecraft and even used and expanded on his lore in their works.  Conan faced unimaginable creatures that shattered the mind to think about.  Robert E Howard and Clark Ashton Smith were writing the same stuff as Lovecraft, just in a different setting.  This was what Arneson and Gygax grew up reading.

The first fantasy game that would become D&D was conceived by Dave Arneson after a weekend of watching horror movies.

The first players to enter the first dungeon walked a little way in, heard some disturbing noises, said ""Oh, hell no!"" and ran out.

A dungeon is a horror movie more than a fantasy movie. It is dark and it should be terrifying.  Role playing is mostly about the actions a character does in these very dangerous situations, not the voices.  I think play loses a lot of flavor when the horror element is lost and the players aren't behaving as terrified individuals would in that situation.

My idea of a perfect dungeon crawl moment is the beginning of ""Aliens"".  They walk in cocky and then drive out petal-to-the-metal screaming and don't stop until someone pries Ripley's fingers off the accelerator.  That's a moment your players will never forget.

197ab9h,Re: AI artwork vs. Human Made,"Not trying be overly preachy re: AI, buuuut…

It’s not even about whether it is right or wrong from a moral standpoint, I’m sure most of you who may not do artwork can understand how difficult it might be for some of us who have made our livelihood this way to see ourselves start being replaced. 

I’m just talking about how it feels - it might be that in a few months or years, handmade art has just become a niche product or a luxury item…that feels like a major potential bummer. Seriously. 

In the meantime, there are so many rad creatives in the RPG and game scene - sometimes it doesn’t hurt to just ask. 

This piece is one I did for free to replace an AI cover I saw here on Reddit. 

I’ll do free art when I can make the time for those who are too broke to afford it - and hopefully, just having artwork made by humans on the cover of your project will generate more interest in it from those to whom that is important.

s7bq1j,Reaffirming r/osr’s support for diversity,"The mod team of r/osr wants to publically reaffirm our support for LGTBQA+ people. Men and women, black, latino, asian, or any other ethnicity. Religious and Athiest/Agnostic. We, the mods, support you and will react appropriately if you experience harassment in our subreddit. We expect the community of r/osr to do the same, to treat everyone on the reddit with respect and equality. If you are uncomfortable with this, I would suggest you either find a reddit more supportive of your beliefs or keep them to yourself. I say re-affirming because this has always been our (unstated) position and we have had the rainbow dice as our banner for awhile now as a subtle statement of this.

If anyone on this site is experiencing harassment, please do report it AND message the mods. We want to know about it AND track it. Do not call it out and say “I’m going to report you”. We have banned people from r/osr and have the option to go so far as to present it to the reddit admins - who can ban someone from reddit completely.

Without diminishing the above, I do want to point out that we strive to treat everyone equally. We support diversity - and the rules are the same for everyone. You do not get to be rude because you are Athiest. You do not get to break the self promotions rules because you’re Asexual. You do not get to be distruptive to the community. Please remember that respectful arguments and disagreement are NOT harassment. It may feel like it, and I encourage you to reach out to the mods if you think you’re being harassed in any sense. But if people are arguing with you, please consider that it may NOT be because of your status, but because your opinion needs reevaluation. We’re all human and sometimes our emotions get the better of us.

Thank you again to the r/osr community. The mods all know how awesome a community you are. Keep up the good work.

To anyone who is even remotely interested, I wholeheartedly recommend it!

184peia,PSA: LotFP has sexual violence built into the core rules,"Lamentations of the Flame Princess has >!rape, genital mutilation!< and sexual violence built into the core rules/mechanics, in the random tables in the ""Summon"" spell. Following Rules as Written, you may be ""forced"" (or at least asked) to roleplay through these acts of sexual violence.

Why post this PSA? I believe, due to the nature of sexual violence and its affect on people and society, that anything containing sexual violence should be clearly labeled as such. Especially with RPG's, where you might be asked to role-play through sexual violence, I believe that it needs to be explicitly cleared with everyone involved.

I regularly see people recommending LotFP along side Basic Fantyasy RPG, OSE, Swords & Wizardry, etc, without making it clear that LotFP has these components of sexual violence built into its core rules, and the others do not. I think a lot of people must not be aware of this, and so I'm posting this so people are aware and can make their own decisions fully informed. Again, this is not just part of the setting of LotFP, it is part of the Core Rules.

For me, it's important that I can hand a player or potential player the ""Core Rulebook"" or ""Players Handbook"" and NOT have them exposed to descriptions of >!rape or genital mutilation!<. I have friends that have been >!raped, and some that have been molested as children!<, and these kinds of descriptions and reminders are traumatizing to them. So it's important to me that they are clearly labeled.

LotFP states ""18+ Explicit Content"", but I'm guessing most people (including me), expect it to mean more ""sexual content and innuendo"" and less ""sexual violence"". I wish Raggi was more clear about what is meant by ""18+ Explicit Content"".

Just to be clear, in order to trigger these mechanics you need to have a character cast the spell ""Summon"", fail a check or two, and then roll just right on the random tables for the spell. There is a good chance most people playing LotFP have never seen these mechanics in action. Also, as a side note, the ""Summon"" spell encourages human sacrifice, in that it will provide a bonus to the caster for some of the random rolls.

The section in question is in the free ""LotFP Weird Fantasy Role-Playing - Player Core Book:Rules & Magic"" (file name LotFPRulesMagicFreeNoArt.pdf)? Here is a quote from that pdf, from under the Summon spell in the Spell Descriptions (pages 134-143, the exact quote coming from pages 141-142 in the subsection 6:""Lust of a Betrayed Lover""):

""All characters within the local area (to be deter- mined by the situation) roll 1d6. Those that roll a 1 are at fault for the situation. All characters not at fault will become allies in the drive to hunt down, subdue, >!and mutilate the genitals !<of all who are at fault. After this is done, all who are not at fault must make a saving throw versus Magic. Those who fail will seek to kill the parties at fault, and all who stand in their way of doing so. The effect ends only when all of the characters at fault have been dealt with, although they will not be hostile with any of the characters present who are not at fault , even if they were hostile or longtime enemies before Summon was cast. If nobody is at fault, then things will get ugly. All characters become obsessed and fixated on one random other character in the vicinity, and >!will attempt to have sex with that character!<—at any cost. The character will first attempt to subdue the subject of his obsession, to unconscious if he can or death if he must, before>! having his way!<. Male- female pairings will result in conception, and 10% of male-male pairings will as well. The offspring will be an otherworldly creature—use these Summon charts to determine exactly what, assuming a 1 HD creature—which will do>! 1d10 damage to a woman carrying it as it is born, 2d10 to a man!<. The effect ends for a character when >!his lust is sated!<.""

It currently is linked from [lotfp.com](https://lotfp.com) and is on DriveThruRPG

Edit: I kind of feel like those who are saying ""It's LotFP and Raggi - It should be obvious what it's going to contain"" are being purposefully obtuse. I wouldn't be surprised if LotFP is in the top 20 OSR games recommended by people on this site - but it's the ONLY game commonly recommended that contains any sexual violence in the core rules. Hence this PSA post.

Edit 2: I really dislike moralizing regarding violence in games, because I feel it leads to silly and pointless quagmires. That said, there are real world scenarios where violence can have a  pragmatic purpose. For instance, defending ones family from a murderer, or defending your country from a conquering force. But there is never a scenario where sexual violence is pragmatic - it is always sadistic, meant to tear down, subvert, violate and destroy. That is why it's treated differently.

Edit 3: This post got way more attention than I expected. I want to make it clear, I am opposed to censorship and support Freedom of Speech. This wasn't a ""call to action"", but if I was going to make a suggestion or request, it would be that when you recommend LotFP, include a warning that it contains sexual violence. You can link to this post if you want.

fyh6z4,"Announcement: Any future ""Zak S won a lawsuit"" posts will be deleted.","Folks,

A little over a year ago, first-hand accounts of abuse of women by Zak Sabbath/Zak S/Zak Smith appeared in various places over the web. This has led to at least one lawsuit, but, to my knowledge, not all of the accusations have been refuted. I do not claim to know the veracity of these accusations, but they come from multiple sources and are not, on the face of it, unbelievable. Due to an overabundance of caution, then, I made the difficult decision to ban Zak from this forum, a ban which remains in place today.

**But, to get to the point:** regardless of whether or not the accusations are true, posts about someone being sued by Zak are not ""industry news""; the OSR is only barely an ""industry"", for one thing. For another, and more importantly, announcements about someone paying Zak S money do not help anyone play their games. They do not lead to productive discussions, nor do I see any indication that they have changed anyone's mind on the subject. Therefore, any such posts will be deleted from hereon in. Anyone making multiple attempts to post them will be banned.

On a related note, any ""I owe Zak S an apology"" posts will be deleted if the person posting it did not make an accusation on this subreddit.

Anyone accusing me of fascism is welcome to create their own blog or subreddit praising Zak S to the high heavens. If you do, please pay close attention when jackbooted thugs do *not* break down your door and arrest you. But note also that using such abusive language is a bannable offense.

oe5jx0,This sums up old school play perfectly.,"I had an exchange with a player in my weekly White Box game that sums up the old school experience perfectly. The elf wizard (whose player was accustomed to 5e) had obtained a strange potion and wanted to know what it was. Here’s what happened:

Player: So what do I have to roll to know what this potion is?
DM: There is no roll. What do you do to figure out what this potion is?
Player: Oh. Well, first I look at it. What does it look like?
DM: The glass vial is round at the bottom with a long, thin stem holding in a cork. It’s filled with a murky black fluid the consultancy of honey.
Player: I uncork it and smell the fluid.
DM: A horrible, pungent smell exudes from the vial. Make a saving throw!
Player: Uh oh! Umm, I fail.
DM: You vomit a little on the cobblestones.
Player: Ewww. Okay, are there any plants around?
DM: There’s a flowerbed nearby.

12tots7,Why I replace the d20 with 3d8 in every d20 system I run.,"I originally implemented this houserule last year as part of a combat overhaul I was writing for 5e. I’ve since come to use it in any d20 system I run, and it has a huge number of benefits (many geared more toward OSR) that I wanted to share for others to consider or even try. As a disclaimer: I’m not saying this way is better, despite how much I prefer it, or that using a d20 is somehow worse. Every table runs things differently, and it’s hard to exaggerate the d20’s success in ttrpg. But, this simple replacement changes the feel of a game so drastically, I have to put forth an argument for it.

# The 3d8 engine:

* Any time you make a check that requires a d20, roll 3d8 instead, using the sum as your base roll and adding modifiers like normal. Positive circumstances or ‘advantage’ adds a d8, negative circumstances or ‘disadvantage’ subtracts a d8.
* For attacks, every natural 8 rolled adds a damage die, and two or more natural 8s trigger “critical” effects (automatic hits, status conditions, etc). If you’d like, you can say 2 or more natural 1s trigger fumbles as well.
* To compensate for the higher average roll, add between +2 and +4 to all target numbers/DCs (I do +2, more might be suitable to your table).

# The math:

Here’s what this does to the probabilities (skip this part if you don’t care about the math).

* Most importantly it turns the flat 5% distribution for any roll into a bell curve, where middle or average rolls are more likely, while rolls at the highest and lowest ends of the range are less likely.
* It gives you a wider range of rolls (3 to 24), and increases the average roll from 10.5 to about 13.5.
* There’s a 3 in 8 chance of getting some extra damage, but a 3 in 64 chance of a crit (plus a little extra with the \~1% from rolling all 8s), ~~about 4.8%~~ \[edit:  ≈4.3%, thank you u/emarsk\] (very close to the original 5%).

# What this does to your game:

The first and greatest factor is an increase in **player agency**, directly due to the bell curve distribution of rolls. With a normal d20, your +2 or +5 or whatever modifier can very easily be washed out by an unlucky roll. You need a very large modifier to be sure of your ability to tackle larger challenges, which is why games like 5e require so many buffs and bonuses to give players confidence to run their characters. With more consistent, average dice rolls, **your players will develop a more natural intuition of what they can do and expect from their stats**.

However, with the extra swingyness of damage from every d8, **combat becomes more exciting and engaging**, despite most rolls being more consistent. Furthermore, it makes it more **deadly** (read: risky and exciting!) because of the higher overall damage output from both sides. **Martials get a much needed buff** next to their spellcasting counterparts, and spellcasters aren’t as powerless when they run out of spells.

DMs can also **more easily predict and control the difficulty of their encounters** without a string of bad (or very good) luck derailing the fight (as often at least). Also, advantage and disadvantage change both the average and the range, making them much more tactically significant, and affect the amount of maximum extra damage dice you may receive on natural 8s/crits. This all gives DMs more control both when prepping and on the fly.

Lastly, **character progression feels more significant**. With a d20, getting another +1 to a stat moves only the range, but you’re barely more likely to roll a higher roll than you were before because every number in that range is just as likely. By moving the peak of your bell curve, your +1 matters more because those higher DC checks are much more consistent now.

# Preemptive rebuttals:

*Why not 2d10?* The bell curve is stronger with more dice, and crits would become very rare for rolling two 10s, and remove the chances of triple or quadruple damage. (You might find this beneficial and do this instead.)

*Why not 3d6 or 4d6?* I found the crit chances to be far too swingy on d6s, but you might want that and are free to use d6s instead.

*What about my favorite hand carved unicorn horn d20 I sold my car for?* You can still use a d20 for completely random things like initiative or death saves (if using those things). I’ve even been suggested that spellcasters use a d20 to preserve the unpredictability of the arcane.

*Doesn’t adding up more numbers every roll take up more time?* It does, and I’ve noticed the effect to be more extreme for newer players, but you get used to it. I think the benefits are worth the learning (bell) curve (budum tss), and I’ve even introduced this system to people entirely new to ttrpg with little complaint.

*What about \[insert some math knowledge here\], your numbers are wrong!* Look, I’m not here to write a math thesis, I’m here to play ttrpgs with my friends. Regardless of the exact percentages, the feel of my games are changed in a way that works better for how I run them. I’m much more interested in hearing about how you tried it and the effects it had than arguing about math on the internet. I’m sure something I said about the math somewhere was off, I did my best to double check my numbers, but months of playtesting has made me confident in how the game itself is affected and that’s what I’m really posting about. **I welcome polite corrections to my math**, I want them even, but I’ve seen people get very rude over it, so please do so kindly.

Let me know what you think, and best wishes to anyone brave enough to endure my drivel of a write up.

y6i3sx,My 5E Group Hated OSE - a post mortem.,"I'm pretty bummed out right now. After just 3 sessions I am pulling the plug on a new OSE campaign I started with friends just last month.  I'm not really sure the point of this post except to share my experience and some lessons learned.

I'd been wanting to run an OSE campaign for awhile but my friends love 5E and had no interest in it. A few of them adamantly said they will play nothing else but 5E.  ""Why do we need to learn a new system?"" was the common response.  I finally got to a point where I decided to just say ""hey, here's what I'm running... join if you'd like to.""  This was probably the first mistake but I was actually somewhat successful as people were interested in playing more D&D and so I sold it as this is D&D but an older version with lighter rules (more rulings, less rules).  The ""5E or nothing"" friends passed on it but I did get a few friends to commit to playing.

The campaign was set in the Wilderlands of High Fantasy and I scattered a bunch of level 1-2 dungeons (Hole in the Oak, Incandescent Grottoes) and mega-dungeons (Castle Xyntillan) around a local area of the map.  I put a couple plot hooks out there to lead the players to the dungeons.  This is where things started to fall apart.  This group in particular had very little player agency and they immediately became paralyzed by the number of choices.  Coming from 5E, they expected me to clue them in on the ""best"" choice.  They wanted me to spoon feed them the optimal choice.  This was the first sign that this wasn't going to work.

Eventually they chose a quest that would bring them to the Hole in the Oak dungeon. However, as luck would have it, they took a path through the dungeon that caused them to awaken the Spectral Hunter and Hounds as their first combat encounter (an extremely hard undead monster for 1st levels).  I emphasized running away and this being a nearly impossible fight at this level.  They made it out alive (shields were shattered) but this left an incredibly bad taste in their mouth.  This was definitely another big mistake on my part. Looking back, I probably shouldn't have triggered this encounter.  I did roll on the reaction table and gave the party a chance to negotiate a way out before combat began but everything went against the players that I felt I had to go through with the combat.  This group really did not like unbalanced encounters or the difficulty involved.  They were not prepared for the difficulty level.  When people say old school D&D is like Dark Souls, they ain't lying.

The next session the party went back to town and had to ""lick their wound"".  They hated how long it took to heal (spending a full day resting to recover 1d3).   They had burned a lot of resources (torches, rations, splintered shields) exploring the dungeon and had very little to show for it.    They sold what little treasure they did find and then had to replenish their supplies.  They started complaining about the mundane activities at this point... managing rations... managing torches... retainers.  They hated all of it.  They did not care for the micromanagement aspect at all or the verisimilitude that these systems provide. Planning for the adventure was not fun to them. They wanted to get straight to the adventure/dungeon and the narrative.

Wilderness travel was a mixed bag with them actively disliking the mechanics of it  (weather, checking lost chance, encounters, eating rations).  One friend commented that if they actually get lost and they spend a whole session wandering aimlessly he would quit.   At this point I realized that they all had no interest in ""emergent"" gameplay and really just wanted me to hand a narrative story/adventure to them.   Even when cool randomly generated map features came up they didn't bother to explore them and instead stuck to the ""quest""/narrative.  They stayed on the rails even though I was giving them a sandbox.

After this last session,  everyone had just about had enough.  The OSR play style was not jiving with them.  One by one they all agreed it was not for them and tapped out.  I've come to realize that this is a very passive group from a player agency perspective and they really want the narrative, on rails story to be handed to them for them to respond to rather then driving it themselves.  To me, this is the biggest difference between OSR games and 5E.  The play style is remarkably different and I understand that now.

I hope this post may be interesting to some of you and that you can learn from my mistakes.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17b2b0e30>,osr,1666030092.0

dn1mx5,Rules about self-promotion,"Hi folks, just wanted to let you know what does and doesn't count as ""spam"" for the purposes of self-promotion here. This is both for the benefit of would-be promoters, and for us the mods, so we don't get overwhelmed by ""this is spam"" alerts for things that aren't really spam.

Communities like this exist in part because there are products for it, and products exist in part because there is a chance of a (probably small) profit from them, and profits exist in part because people know of the product, so, with that in mind, here are **The Rules:**

1. You are allowed to announce your blog or product *once*. An exception can be made for things like, e.g., Kickstarter, for an announcement within 48 hours of the funding deadline or once the product has funded. (EDIT: or contact the mods if you are uncertain.)

2. You must make a full disclosure that you are promoting your own work *in the post title*, such as ""I put up my new adventure on drivethrurpg"", or ""I have a new blog, I hope you like it"".

3. It would be best if you already have a presence here on /r/osr, but second best would be to become a regular, making productive posts and comments about works or ideas that *aren't* your own stuff. This is a fuzzy rule, I understand, but if the *only* things we see from someone are self-promotions, there is a good chance subsequent entries will be blocked, or the user will be banned.

4. This should go without saying, but the work must be germane to the topic of OSR-style gaming.

5. Feel free to post updates to your blog weekly, but no more frequently than that.

6. Rules for posts also apply to comments; if your product or blog *really* relates to the topic at hand, feel free to link, but rickroll-style responses are *verboten*. (Rule #2 also applies here.)

7. In general, this subreddit has a ""two strikes and you're out"" rule, but blatant and deliberate disregard for the rules counts as two strikes.

While not a rule—yet—we'd appreciate it if anything that deals with excessive gore, explicit sex, or other adult topics were labeled ""NSFW"". 

We also reserve the right to unlink any post or product that has as its aim the marginalization of anyone based on social category: age, race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion—you know the drill. (People who call this ""censorship"" are probably not smart enough to be members or /r/osr.)

In short, be transparent, don't overdo it, and we hope your work reflects well not only on yourself, but the OSR community in general. Good luck!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17b6f7b00>,osr,1572028283.0

10pj3o1,Labyrinth Lord 2.0 is changing into a completely different beast now!,"Interesting developments in **Labyrinth Lord 2e**. According to Dr. Dan Proctor in the LL2e Private FB Group:   

>""One of the things I said a few months back is that **Labyrinth Lord** doesn't need to be a clone anymore. The situation is different than in 2007. There are many clones. There's no need to preserve the old rules.  
>  
>**Labyrinth Lord**'s path ahead is expanding beyond being a clone. To offer an interpretation that is more of myself, not constrained by someone else's canon.  
>  
>The **OGL** issue that's been on all of our minds has made that vision clearer. I'll be releasing 2e as a stand alone game, not connected to the **OGL**. Since I wanted more breathing room for LL anyway, this has benefited the project. It will be a game to play or take ideas from for other **B/X** games.  
>  
>**Labyrinth Lord 2e** will have procedure and rule differences, new and/or completely reworked spells, and totally different presentation of monsters. Those that overlap **B/X** are mostly rewritten to be closer to their folk origins, sometimes deviating in my own way. **All magic items, with some exceptions, are completely replaced in 2e.**  
>  
>Character classes are similar to B/X, with some notable differences. **Clerics are removed, their spells were replaced or reworked and folded into all of the spells. Some spells didn't make the cut, so don't have analogs. So the new classes are brownies, elf-like people that average 4' to 4.5' tall, who combine elements of spell casters and thieves. And cyclops, large people with one eye. Very tough fighters, kind of filling a barbarian role. The other classes are intact, if tweaked.**  
>  
>I've now finished writing and reworking analogs of all spells from **LL** and **AEC**. This number of spells opens the possibility of specialist mages.  
>  
>My goal when you read **Labyrinth Lord 2e** is to make you feel like you're rediscovering the game. **Monsters don't do what you expect them to. Spells are familiar but different. Magic items are different and have a different personality.** Classes are similar but you have some more options.  
>  
>Now I continue to edit and rewrite the rules. I will probably add some more magic items and monsters, maybe a few spells. I'm hoping to have a playtest draft ready in February. I don't want to rush that, especially because this is more than just a revision.

us0829,"I've never had more fun playing DND in my life, and I have no one to gush with.","While I was always interested in DND, I never got the chance to play until a friend introduced me to 5e 5 or 6 years ago. Since then I've run 3 full-length campaigns with the same loyal friends. like many of you, though, I'm sure, I've become burnt out with the Mary Sue archetypes and the bloated, boring combat.

Recently a group of coworkers expressed interest in playing DND, and I knew this was my chance.   


I introduced them to OSE. We hung out, had some beers, rolled 3D6 down the line, and everyone was into it. I took a tip from RuneHammer and explained to them that this was a sacred ritual; a right of passage for all true table-top gamers. We had a BLAST making characters, seeing how the dice would roll.

I used a few dungeons from Gavin as inspiration and crafted my own 1st level OSR tutorial dungeon, complete with giant spiders, deadly traps, naive and helpful kobolds (in exchange for some coin) and a discovery-based narrative that lead to the reawakening of Lolth, the Spider Queen.

Just one coworker was a 5e vet, the other three where total newbies. The 5e vet tried to take a rest after the very first encounter, and I encouraged them to think twice about trying to stay the night in a dangerous dungeon without supplies. Spiders were lurking. They got the point, and from there, it was full immersion.

One of the players got his head caved in immediately. He triggered a trap and failed his save. I felt terrible, he was playing a gentle-giant aspiring botanist  gargantuan. From a previous encounter and skill check it was already clear he was the party's strong man. Seeing his head cave in from one careless step really set the tone, and he was a total champion about it.

We had a spare cleric ready to go and he was back in the game the next room, and he picked up the transition perfectly.

They used problem solving, creativity, cunning, equipment and wits to solve puzzles, disarm traps, ward off giant spiders, and get the treasure. They got their EXP and all 4 of them are ready for more. The 5e vet said he had ""an amazing time.""

I fucking love the OSR, guys. My regular 5e group shows absolute zero interest, but honestly, I don't know how I could ever go back...",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17b8e9cd0>,osr,1652832858.0
tt0k5k,Decided to fully embrace the OsR and now I’m playing the best dnd of my life.,"Like a lot of folks I skipped 4th Edition D&D, and returned to the hobby with 5th Edition. It really felt like D&D had returned to its roots and hooked me right back in. Since then I’ve exclusively DM’d 5e and mostly had a blast. Eventually I started to get this nagging feeling that something was missing. I was growing tired of the narrative focused, super heroic style and started yearning for the old school style of adventuring for gold and glory. Like a lot of people I started hacking the system apart trying to find ways to manipulate my players into playing something that honestly they weren’t all that interested in. 

  I eventually learned about the OsR scene, but I just couldn’t commit to some of the, what I considered “antiquated rules”, and ended up playing a watered down version. Of course this didn’t work and I went back to 5e. I once again hacked and slashed until I thought for sure I had the perfect osr 5e experience. I was wrong. It quickly devolved into superheroes but with this time without the narrative that holds it together. I went back to the drawing board and started absorbing everything I could about what made osr tick. I eventually realized that the systems I criticized before like gold as xp had very specific reasons for existing. They completely change player motivations and lead to the exact gameplay experience I was looking for. 

  At this point I was all in. I didn’t just want osr, I wanted the most osr, osr, ever. I wanted Blackmoor. I wanted a large group of players, a massive hex map, and a persistent world with meticulous time keeping. I wanted domain play, high lethality, lack of balance and a focus on exploration. I went to work and built a world. At the same time, like a sign from the dice gods, Questing Beast released a video literally detailing the exact thing I was working on. Anyway this is getting long, so long story short I did it. I now have an open table group of 26 players and growing, (m hoping to hit Gygax’s number of 50 players) and I’m playing the BEST games of dnd I’ve ever experienced. It has the exact feel I was trying to achieve. I have players exploring the wilds. Forming organizations. Building taverns. Forming adventuring guilds.

12u2j1j,On improv GMing,"I have been a full improv GM for a few years now. I think some systems and settings are particularly good suited to this approach, even for running long campaigns. I really dig it because it surprises myself as a GM and allows space for some amazing spontaneous creativity from everyone involved. I know its not everyone's cup of tea but I have grown to become addictive to it and the fact that it diminishes session preparation to just a 1-2 hours before players show up is definitely a big plus. 

Is anyone else from the OSR community doing improv gming or I am a lonely weirdo on this? 

Would love to show a few pointers and share techniques if anyone is interested in trying out this approach. I have studied Clown and improv acting in the past so that has been super useful for my experience.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17bd650a0>,osr,1682085318.0

Love how B2 makes their captains unique with different HD, weaponry, armor, and so on. We always did this back in the day - no such thing as a straightforward or easy orc fight.

1h0si5d,The Ruins of Bitterfort,"
On the banks of the Hardrun River, the Bitterfort used to be men’s foothold against the often dangerous Wyrdwood. 

Those days are long gone now, and relegated to the past - trees and brambles now grow through the stones, and new denizens have taken up residence.

A group of militant and particularly brutal orcs, led by a Wyr captain await a special group of guests - the Dréadh coven of Black Hill. 

An evil ritual is underway to the Wyr’s dark lords - and even grimmer plans to recover a lost relic from the ruins of Fallenstar.

Beyond the fort, the remnants of Elfgate Bridge - once said to be the entrance to the Underworld kingdom of Alberon and Tanía…

Men would trade goods and safely traverse the Man-Road, and all prospered. 

Those days, too, have fallen into nothing more than sorrow and legend.

zx3pk5,A Grognard's Principles for Prepping and Running OSR Games,"I've played a lot of OSR games, and with it, I have crafted some guiding principles that have served my games well. Hope this can be of help, and invite discussion of what principles others follow.

# Preparing For a Session

## 1. Your first session should start just outside the dungeon entrance

  * __Reason__: Having the first session begin directly outside of the dungeon immediately gives the players a clear objective—explore the dungeon. This lets the session hit the ground running as players will jump immediately into action. Not to mention, this gives your preparation a clear end point.

     * Really, any clear objective and confined location should work since it simplifies prep to one location so the players can immediately jump into the meat of the game.

## 2. Ask what your players will do next session

 * __Reason__: Sessions are best when you have good preparation, so leaving things ambiguous as to what the characters will do session can lead to a lot of wasted prep. Be upfront with your players and say what they decide is what you will prepare, so no changing minds last second. They will understand and it will make your game world all the better.

## 3. Only prepare for the next session

 * __Reason__: Over-prepping is more likely to burn you out than help you. __Broad stroke ideas are enough for hooks to leave your players. They do not need to be fleshed out until they will be encountered in the upcoming session__.

## 4. Sprinkle hooks to adventures liberally around your world. __Each location prepared should have at least one hook to another location__.

 * __Reason__: Doing this will create a web of relationships that make your game world come to life. This will make it easier for players to create their own objectives within the world.

## 5. Factions should have a goal, an obstacle, and a plan to overcome that obstacle.

 * __Reason__: This hits the sweet spot for prepping just enough to have great utility while not over prepping a faction in case your group never interacts with them.

 * Idea from [this GFC DND video](https://youtu.be/-ORbIu5C5UM). All the videos on that channel are well worth watching by the way.


# Dungeon Design

## 1. Follow a Dungeon Checklist for stocking your dungeon
 1. Something to talk to
 2. Multiple routes and branches to explore
 3. Environments that can be altered
 4. Something to kill you
 5. Something to slay
 6. Treasure to take
 7. Something to experiment with
 8. Something hidden


 * Original idea from [Goblin Punch's blog post](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/01/dungeon-checklist.html?m=1)

## 2. Leave hints about other locations within the dungeon

 * __Reason__: This lets the players make intelligent decisions about how they are going to approach exploring the dungeon. You want players to think things like, ""should we follow these scratches or head the other way?"".

## 3. Make sure there are no bland swinging-bags-of-HP style encounters

 * __Reason__: Fights where the players and enemies alternate rolling without making a decision more meaningful than ""I roll to hit the monster"" are boring and undesirable. Don't do this, I'll explain more further down.

# Combat Encounters

## 1. Combats are best kept short and sweet

 * __Reason__: The interesting decisions in a fight tend to be made early in the fight. Once the interesting choices have been made (e.g. PCs/enemies utilizing the environments for an upper hand) then the combat should be nearing a close. 
 * __Roll for morale!__ Your enemies shouldn't want to die. 

## 2. Dynamic environments, enemy tactics, or secondary objectives add a good layer of complexity to what could be an otherwise bland fight.

 * __Environment Example__: Environments that have high potential energy are ideal. Locations that contain a cliff on a battle field, or the threat of a falling rocks trap provide the players/enemies an environmental means of gaining an upper hand.

 * __Enemy Tactics__: A goblin gang might jump the PCs then try to get the players to chase them into an ambush; a team of orcs might target and try to kidnap the smallest member of the party. The point is the enemies have a goal beyond take turns rolling dice until they are dead.

 * __Secondary Objectives__: Objectives like ""take that wand from the Kobold Shaman"", or ""protect the prisoner from getting recaptured"" are worth adding on occasion.
 
 * Don't go overboard with this, but do keep it in mind.

# Running the Dungeon

## 1. State room descriptions in this order: Dimension & Exits, Monsters, then Details.

 * __Reason__: Dimensions and exits of the room first so the players have a sense of space and the mapper can write it down. Describe sensory details of the monsters seen, preferring to avoid stating its name outright. Then describe key details of the room. Use cardinal directions frequently where appropriate.
 
   * Having a standard order for narration helps hit all the important details of a room consistently.

## 2. When moving, count off feet (or squares) moved in a cardinal direction

 * __Example__: ""You move west down the hallway 5ft, 10ft, 15ft—you are standing in the middle of a T intersection with the halls continuing north or south. What do you do?""

 * __Reason__: This makes life easier for you and the mapper. They will be able to more accurately map, and tracking turns used in movement becomes much simpler.

## 3. Frequently restate the current situation and where the players are located.

 * __Reason__: Restating frequently helps keep players from losing their sense of space and surroundings so everyone can stay on the same page. This is especially important to do when entering new rooms/chambers. E.g. are the players standing at the entrance to the room? Or have they entered and are standing in the middle?

# Miscellaneous Things I Recommend

## 1. Use a caller

 * A caller is the player who is designated to state what all the player characters do in a dungeon turn. Other players can of course correct the caller should they misspeak.

 * __Reason__: Structuring conversation through a caller keeps turns organized much better than resolving things as players state what they want to do directly at you, the GM. This might sound unappealing at first, but it works remarkably well for keeping the game moving. Players talk among themselves, and ask questions to you about what they plan on doing. The turn only gets resolved when the caller is done stating what actions are being taken this turn.

## 2. Roll as little as possible

 * __Reason__: Never roll for things that you expect the PCs to be able to do. Unless there is some significant risk (e.g. hp loss) or reason they might fail, then the players should succeed with most things by default no dice being rolled.

## 3. Roll ^almost everything in the open

 * __Reason__: Doing this has numerous positive effects on the table. For starters, it prevents you from cheating your players as a crutch by showing them the consequences of their actions. Enemies won't pull their punches. As a knock on effect (in my experience at least), players see the dice as an antagonist instead of the GM. Even more, rolling in the open has fostered better cooperation between players and the GM at all the tables I have been at.

 * Secret rolls can be kept secret.

## 4. Utilize Procedures

 * __Reason__: Organization of play is key to keeping a steady and enjoyable pace to the game. It's a lot harder to get derailed with it than without it.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17bf233e0>,osr,1672213334.0

1evkr02,Discovering OSR ruined other RPG playstyles for me,"I have a background of about 7 years DMing 5e, but also World of Darkness games, Powered by the Apocalypse-like games etc. As a GM, I've basically struggled from the start, and often my struggles relate to adventure design, specifically making an interesting plot and designing a line through the adventure while leaving enough space and tools to play with to allow for player freedom. My plots never felt interesting, getting players to follow them was a pain (""my character is not interested in that"") and getting ""off the rails"" has always been scary for me, not because I'm afraid of improvising, but because once there's rails, that becomes constraining for that improvisation. And the fear of characters dying, both from players because they are very attached, and from me as it can derail the adventure. 

Discovering the OSR, it just feels more right. No grand plot but an interesting world to explore, from which a story evolves. Players being challenged themselves to be genuinely creative and resourceful and death isn't a nuisance that threatens the end the campaign, it's part of the design. A more player-driven outlook, so no more needing to convince players or characters to go on an adventure.  Admittedly these aspects might not be exclusive to OSR but the point stands. 

Knowing that this way of playing exists, makes it even more draining to prep for other games, and playing in such games can be frustrating. Knowing death isn't really on the table because nobody wants the campaign to end, just suddenly makes everything feel pointless? I don't want to meta game but when the GM clearly prepared a certain plot or adventure line, I can't help but be aware of that fact and have it influence my actions. I can't help but feel like, despite there being freedom within the boundaries of the adventure, there's still a fairly clear limit to freedom, and there's a rebellious side in me that finds that knowledge frustrating, like I'm forced to dance to someone elses tune. 

All of this frankly makes me feel a little alienated from the community at large, because this way of playing is massively popular (mostly due to 5e's success). All my friends play that way and like it, but as I've gotten frustrated with the playstyle, I feel less enjoyment playing or running those games. I wish I could fully share their enjoyment as I once did, because in the end that's the most valuable thing this hobby has given me.

After the rise of G+ ate a lot of the blogger scene, and the fall of G+ then scattered the OSR to the eight winds, it’s really cool to see this subreddit coalesce. Better for discussions than Twitter, searchable, and I won’t say a thing about metabook (nice folks there, but the FB algo and company just wrecks it for me).

1hw6hs5,"Hexcrawls and ""density of content""","Hello guys!
So lately I've decided to get another group to run the game for besides the current group I run.
In the old group I'm running a module called ""Scourge of the Northland"".
For the new group, I'm setting the game in the same world, but in another region. For them I'll be running B2 Keep on the Borderlands.
While trying to make an hexmap for this new group I came across some difficulty with populating hexes.
I spread out some stuff from B2 and added some stuff of my own to the south. So I think that part is decently populated. But I had to make the rest of the hexmap myself (because I wanted it to match SotN's map in size somewhat closely). 
Now I'm faced with some difficulty deciding where to place things.
I have:
- awakened undead crypt
- Dwarven city
- Human and dwarf town
- wizard's tower
- dangerous pass that can be used to enter Northland

But things still feel somewhat empty.
I've tried to make up some rumors to incentivise the players to explore but it still doesn't really feel like it's enough.
Should I just roll for them to get lost and when they wander into another hex I check if I there's a feature there? 
If so should I generate an actual location with things to do or simply ""something interesting"" (like Instead of a village or a camp, just and old runestone or something)? Couldn't that lead to an overtly saturated map?

I want things to feel distant from each other and that making a trip requires preparation. But not so distant as to have everything feel isolated.

Here is the current map for reference.
(Sorry for poor quality).
The northern part is made by me and the southern part is an adaptation of the B2 map.

1f3scds,"B/X is so intuitive, I don't have to really ""prep"" anymore session to session.  ","To be clear, it was a lot of work before the game started.  I run Jacob Fleming's OSE modules with two groups on roll20, and before the first sessions I  uploaded all the maps (world, dungeon, and some wilderness encounters), as well as monster and npc tokens I would maybe need for several sessions. 

But now all I have to do is just roll encounters before a game.  It's all up to the players entirely on where to go and what to do.  I get to use my brain power during the session to run monsters during encounters and describe what's happening.  

No more laying down ""track"" of where players can go or trying to predict their movements.  Oh, you want to abandon the town under siege and go off into the mountains to go hunting?  Sure, you have the rations?  

No more fretting over balanced encounters.  Players  (mostly) approach the world and encounters with extreme caution because characters can actually die. I get to just enjoy listening to them strategize on what to do.  

No more DC nonsense. Roll under for an ability or over for a save.  Me and the players just decide when it's necessary, and often times it isnt unless its stated.  

Dungeon and wilderness exploration is guided by clear cut procedures. 

Combat procedures, in particular, ensure encounters are strategic and dramatic. No three hour slogs.  Characters die, but nothing ever seems unfair or contrived.  

No more thinking of mission hooks.  At first it was gold the players were after to level up, but over time the players, not me, built the story based on their actions.  Treasure is still a top priority, though.  

At the end of a session all I do is make a couple of notes on how the players actions may influence the world, record some of their ideas about what they think is happening and then, before next session roll up a few more encounters.  

I know this whole new dnd book is releasing this month, but I loathe the idea of having to go back and building the game while I'm driving it.  

After a year and half of play on my last 5e campaign I was totally burnt out and frustrated.  After a year and half of play on my OSE campaigns (plural) we are going strong and can't wait for the next session.  

I know I'm preaching to the choir with this but dang, coming B/X OSE was the best decision I ever made in the hobby.   It is a truly remarkable ttrpg system.

Each book is a different nation and gives you anything you want to set up a campaign. Whether it's Dwarves, Elves, Halflings, Vikings, or Orcs Mystara has something for everyone. Add to that the Hollow World stuff and you literally have two worlds in one.

The way it handles characters, exploration, and danger is exactly what I didn’t know I was looking for back then. No rigid classes, just who you are and what you carry. And the game actually trusts you to be creative instead of boxing you into a list of pre-approved actions. It’s wild how much freedom it gives without ever feeling loose or undefined.

I put a party of 4 Level 1 PCs through ‘Barrow of the Bone Blaggards’ by Necrotic Gnome because I know it pretty much off by heart. 5e’s lack of exploration procedures and dungeon turns, as well as how distinctly special and overpowered even a Level 1 party is, was infuriating. Darkvision, cantrips, and many class features just make it a complicated and poor situation.

However, by far the worst offender was the Skill system. I had to shut down players calling for their own skill checks: “You step carefully into the murky chamber-“ “Perception - 11, damn!” “Please, just let me finish and roll when I ask you to.” The players constantly insisted on contextualising everything from the myriad numbers on their sheets as opposed to making in-universe decisions.

The players had a good time, and I didn’t show my frustrations, but it was so disappointing that they couldn’t get the full experience due to the leeway given by a bloated and weak system.

I’ve never felt more vindicated that the OSR/NSR/rules-light space is the place for me. I’ll be sticking with my staples of Cairn, OSE, Vaults of Vaarn, X-Borgs, Into the Odd, and Mothership from now on!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17d8f3f80>,osr,1737287114.0

1fuim30,"💀Deathbringer, at the Laundromat ⚔️🧺","Bought this off of Drivetrhurpg, deciding to give it a shot. Deathbringer created by Professor Dungeonmaster from the YouTube channel Dungeon Craft it is a rules lite fantasy RPG. If you're familiar with Warhammer you can tell right away that it was inspired by the Warhammer Fantasy setting. Or at least that's what came to mind when reading the classes. 

As stated in the beginning it can be a stand alone game but can also be a splat book to add to your table be it OSE for example or even 5e. I liked the idea of Deathbringer dice kind of reminds of DCC in that regard. 

Kiddos assigned points to the stats they felt were important and selected classes. My son of course went with the Deathbringer class which is akin to a fighter, my youngest daughter selected the Plague Doctor.

Next they rolled up some backgrounds my son getting bounty hunter, and my daughter getting outlaw. Finally rolled for misery. We decided to roll for two of them to really flesh out their history. My son getting banished from home and left for dead. He decided that he knew some dark family secret that warranted him being killed, my daughter got owe someone money, and killed someone important. I'm gonna have fun with that one. She basically is a heretic in the eyes of the Church.

xqqedr,Dr. Dan Proctor Announces the Future of Goblinoid Games and Labyrinth Lord,"He wrote the letter in a private Facebook group, so I'm reposting it here: 


""When I suspended Goblinoid Games' social media presence two months ago, it was because I gave myself an ultimatum.

I would write a substantial, totally new product by the first of the year and be well on my way to editing a new edition of Labyrinth Lord. If I didn't succeed in these challenges, I had decided I would close up shop for good. I am near completion of a new solo adventure, currently sitting at around 24,000 words.

In retrospect, maybe I shouldn't have been so hard on myself. I've suffered from moderate to severe anxiety for about the last seven years, amplified by a series of large life changes. The kind of life changes you check the boxes for on a form to determine how much stress you have in your life. At any given time during those years I would probably have three or four big ones happening at once. As a result, all of my hobbies essentially came to a halt. It was hard enough to get by day-to-day, much less write creative content and keep up with the demands of my publishing business. Some of you know I'm a professor, and just performing those duties was challenging enough. And of course Covid.

But I'm happy to say that at this point I'm in a much better place than I've been in years. I've come to terms with many things in my life, and I'm finally in a position to pick up where I left off. I know the industry has changed, and I know many of my supporters have been disappointed with my lack of support for my game lines, Labyrinth Lord especially. I've also let down my publishing partners. But I'm here to tell you today that all of that is coming to an end.
I'm still a one-person, Indy publisher, but in addition to my own efforts I'll be be reaching out to others for partnerships moving forward. I'm very excited for what the future holds, and I hope some of you will join me on this new journey.

To read a little bit more about what I have in mind, please visit my website. It's still under construction but I have some information there about what's next for Labyrinth Lord.

Its an old school homage to classic Sword and Sorcery films, but is also just a straight up Dungeon Crawl with a classic adventuring party as its leads. Theres even cannon fodder hirelings, puzzles and moments comparable to ability checks. 

Im hoping this fits here, because the film is a small indie production and really isnt as well known as it should be. Really to me nails the OSR aesthetic and is a definite recommend.

We also found a game called Hieronymus in our local game store and after reading through the rules, it feels very much OSR.

11bk8gs,The Joy of Using Otter Checks in Dungeons,"Many (all?) of us know the value in the Wandering Monster check. Recently however, I've been seeing value in a check of another sort... the ""Suddenly, Otters!"" Check.

Whenever the party encounters water in the dungeon -- an underground river, a waterfall plunging down into the depths of the Underdark, a tranquil pool in which lissom lamia lasciviously laze -- and linger for more than one turn, I make a ""Suddenly, Otters!"" Check on a `D6`.

1. No otters. 😭
2-5. Suddenly, otters! (`D6+3` otters appear.)
6. A singular otter appears; roll on the _Singular Otters_ table below.

This table will, generally, result in otters appearing more often than not. This is fine because otters are cool and I love them so much. Who doesn't love otters? We need more otters in our D&D.

I find that the party often engages with the otters; rarely, the otters are just there and the party otherwise ignores them; sometimes the party hunts them for food; at other times the party hunts and skins the otters for their pelts. The latter activities all take up precious time, burning through resources such as torches and cranking up those Wandering Monster Checks.

If the ""a singular otter appears"" result is rolled, I make a second `D4` roll on the _Singular Otters_ table.

1. An avatar of Ottar Sathla -- the Primordial Otter Who Roams The Astral Plane -- manifests!
2. A prismatic otter appears, it's fur glistening with rainbow colours. (Such prismatic pelts sell for lashings of gold.)
3. The party has stumbled upon an _Otter Graveyard_, the place to which all otters return to die. What treasures lie beneath the mounds of little otter skeletons... and what evils?
4. Retto the Younger slithers out of the water and asks to join the party; she is a 4th Level Thief, stands as tall as three crucified halflings, and possesses a _Smooth Pebble Of Clam Opening_ which functions as the spell _Knock_ with regard to opening shellfish with one charge weekly.

17qs0sz,Something I learned after switching from 5e to OSR,"I can be so much more permissive with players and I think they love that. There’s no skill checks and OSR is very harsh on them already with it’s danger level. So when I just 
*allow* something my players say they do, I don’t feel like I’m being too easy on them. It also seems to lend to believability of the situation. Why can’t my character just hide in a closet, why would the skillcheck ever fail? 

This feels very freeing as a GM. And WHEN I say something fails they don’t feel bad and I don’t feel bad because I was able to allow so many other things. They don’t feel cheated and like I’m making stuff up just to thwart them. 

You’re faster than the opponents? You escape, no problem. 

You use your one super overpowered early spell?
Great. It works beautifully, but was it the right spot? Who knows. But it was YOUR decision.  And now you’re out of spells. But my player is so happy that their one spell worked instead of just blasting away the same spell 500 times. Every resource used makes them FEEL powerful because there is restrictions.

Running the game like this is what I feel like my fantasy of what being a GM is. Not just the person that describes the random dice roll outcome.

5e does have the benefit of just blaming the dice when things go wrong, but this feels much more satisfying when you’re a relatively competent GM.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17dc7f740>,osr,1699467957.0

Barker, creator of Tékumel and Empire of the Petal Throne, wrote a neo-nazi novel in 1991.","The book was called Serpent's Walk, and was published by the same company that published infamous neo-nazi book The Turner Diaries. This has been known by a few people for a couple of years, or possibly longer. A former archivist for The Tekumel Foundation posted the following in 2020:

""I had had no idea that this book existed until I found the manuscript, the original cover art, the publishing contract, the photocopy of the payment check, and the proof copies of the book in amongst Phil's papers. I secured all this material for the Tekumel Foundation, in my capacity as an archivist, at that time under contract with them, and the last I saw it was all still on their shelves when I did the photo inventory of Phil's collection in their offices in October of 2012 after I did not renew my dollar-a-year contract with them. (I do not judge the data I collect; I set it in the context I find it, and let others evaluate it. My reaction, as it had been when Phil had done things like this in the past, was ""Oh, Phil, WHY?"")""

When I run OD&D I don’t have to worry about stepping on the toes of the rule set, and can get players ready in mere minutes. Despite the smaller number of classes, home-brewing rewards tailor-made for a player’s envisioned character seems easy in comparison to the wealth of innate abilities in 5e.

1h925nb,A 'What' Fiend?,"Laying in bed, bored with bronchitis today, when a post on here gave me a flashback to an old gaming memory. It hearkens back to when 'meta-gaming' was something a lot of people still took seriously. This might get long, but I'm not going anywhere for a while, so let's get started.  

Back in the mid-90s, I was talking with my original DM, the guy who got me into the game and passed away from alcoholism this February at the age of 46. We always took turns DMing, but we never got to play together because no one else in our groups liked DMing. He said we should go see if there were any postings at the local hobby store (local being 45 miles away). So, we did, and the owner of the establishment told us about this group of older guys who were looking for two new members, gave us their number, and sent us on our way.  

We called the number and talked for a while and they agreed to bring us in for a game and see if we were a good fit. We were like 17 and 18 at the time and these guys were all in their forties and had been playing since before we were born. Also, they were all bounty hunters, police officers, and such, so we were very intimidated. Nice guys, though!  

We chatted for a while before the game, asking each other about our experiences with the game, cool gaming memories, and so on. Turns out this group of three players and the DM had been playing since 1977, with the same guy DMing every session. They started a new campaign when 2nd Edition came out in '89, and this game we were taking part in was that campaign, like eight years into it! And they were all only around 10th level. Made us feel like munchkiny power gamers!  

So, during the session, I'm doodling on a piece of paper. I was drawing a pit fiend, and one of the guys said, ""Whoa, what is that you're drawing?"" I said, ""It's a pit fiend...?"" thinking everyone knows what that is, right? But they all got up and bent down to look at it and were just oohing and ahing. One of them asked, ""You've fought one of these before? Did you live?"" And it struck me just how dedicated and hardcore these guys were about D&D.  

Not just the giant hand drawn, framed world map hanging behind the DM's chair, or the fifty page campaign bibles they printed out for us detailing their eight year long adventure, or the expertly painted minis and custom battle mats, but these mother fuckers had been playing D&D for twenty years, and since they had never fought a pit fiend, they didn't even know what it was!  

We explained that we were both DMs too, and we were looking for the game because we never got to play together, and they understood. But one of them said, ""Ah, that must take a lot of the magic and mystery out of the game when you're a player."" And that's when I told him, ""Dude, we've been playing for like six hours now and I've never encountered a single thing I've seen here tonight before. All of your magic items, the monsters we've fought, all of this is new to me, and I've read pretty much every DM's book printed."" They all looked at their DM who was grinning from ear to ear.  

No one said anything else about it after that, we just went back to playing. But I think those guys got a much greater understanding of what an incredible DM they had, and my friend and I got a look at what great players could be. Anyway, I'm gonna go hit the cough medicine and pass out, just felt like sharing a memory!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17de0c1a0>,osr,1733605276.0

1clq22x,The Wrinkled Sorcerer,"By Tim Molloy. This little guy is important to me because he’s the one who started the Painted Wastelands project. I emailed Tim asking to work with him and sent him a sample page adapting this piece of art into an RPG adventure. Tim loved the vibe.

The wrinkled sorcerer is friendly but speaks an alien language. If you smoke ectoplasm from his long stemmed pipe you roll a d6 on a chart and receive your reward. The results are labeled: Bad Trip, Lost in Translation, Deep Sleep, Mind Melt, Incorporeal Touch, and Knowledge of the Ancients. 

This wrinkled scrotum sorcerer is smoking ectoplasm. It’s the foundational “atomic” bedrock structure of everything in the Lower Ethereal Hierarchy. It occurs naturally, responds to will, and can produce visions and other effects if directly smoked or inhaled. Money from the central bank is backed by it.

13kuwpv,"For the love of god, use Dungeon Magazine when looking for adventures.","I won't say they're all suitable for each campaign, but after skimming through 10 issues, each of which had like 4 adventures, at least 1/4 was pretty good. They seem to be fairly setting neutral from the ones I've read as well, but I haven't seen all of them. They are fairly short adventures, each seems like it'd take between 1-3 sessions to complete, but they have a good amount of variety. It's a great way of providing a lot of options for PC's without having to literally design a dozen adventures for an adventurer's job board. They're all available online on archive.org",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17df08470>,osr,1684405633.0

1bjlvaq,"Steelgrave, a neofeudal city","Wanted to share a little progress on my next zine and thought some input could be fun since people here often have killer ideas. 

The map here shows a core area of Steelgrave, a city struggling under feudal tyranny some 100 years or so post “event.” (Whatever wrecked the world)

We’ve been running the game using White Box (though probably switching to Wight Box next week) - it has custom classes to fit the post apocalyptic vibe and the three sessions we’ve had so far have been a blast. 

The players are working on their own gang, staking claim on a tiny headquarters and forging alliances and battling other crews, while trying to avoid ORC patrols and helping out the impoverished and largely hopeless peasantry when they can…and delving into the dangerous tunnels and dungeons of the undercity. Steelgrave is placed on the Outdoor Survival map, so hexcrawling will factor in down the line of the players want to go that route. 

This map is largely keyed, but what jumps out when you look at it? What parts would you want to explore or give you ideas? (I promise I won’t use anyone’s ideas without permission if something hits me or is better or more flavorful than what I have now, I promise!!!)

Map was done by Fern Cliff studio, who I commissioned for the work based on another map he posted here in the OSR sub- they were amazing to work with, highly recommended!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17dfdaf90>,osr,1710962517.0

hpyx28,Rising OSR tide,"Hi. I'm Courtney from the Blog Hack & Slash.

I publish a zine called Megadungeon. It is about Numenhalla, keyed for both Basic and 5e. It has a circulation of around 500 copies. 

I don't think enough people know about cool new stuff (including me) so I sell advertising for OSR/classic style adventure fantasy RPG stuff in the zine. It's 20$ for half a page or 40$ for a full page.

Or it's free.

Free free, no catch, no hooks. 

If you've got something you made and you don't have money, I'll run your ad for a gaming product for free. No cost, no hooks. I'll even shoot you a free copy of the PDF for contributing. If you've got the money, cool! I can assure you it will go towards medication I have to take that I have no insurance for, or food for my 7 year old daughter. I'm just a guy renting an apartment.

If not, I don't care, you make the world a better place by sharing your project. 

Advertisement must be at least 300 dpi and black and white. I'd need to get them within the next ten (10) days. You can contact me here, or at my e-mail (campbell at oook dot cz)
