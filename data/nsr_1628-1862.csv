1gkdm0v,I think too many RPG reviews are quite useless,"I recently watched a 30 minute review video about a game product I was interested in. At the end of the review, the guy mentioned that he hadn't actually played the game at all. That pissed me off, I felt like I had wasted my time. 

When I look for reviews, I'm interested in knowing how the game or scenario or campaign actually plays. There are many gaming products that are fun to read but play bad, then there are products that are the opposite. For example, I think Blades in the Dark reads bad but plays very good - it is one of my favorite games. If I had made a review based on the book alone without actually playing Blades, it had been a very bad and quite misleading piece. 

I feel like every review should include at the beginning whether the reviewer has actually played the game at all and if has, how much. Do you agree?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11458b9b0>,rpg,1730831383.0

4wuhj4,"I figured out why I hated Suicide Squad so much; it was like watching a superhero themed RPG, played by all of the most annoying players ever.","Suicide Squad spoilers ahoy:

...

...

...

First of all, they all decided to play neutral/evil characters, despite the DM announcing a superhero themed game with a heroic plot. DM allows it for some reason, attempts to tweak the setup to allow it on the fly by making them beaten supervillains working for reduced prison sentences.

Deadshot is the one player actually attempting to take it seriously, even going so far as to give his character a back story. He tries his best, but he's not that good at improvising dialogue, so he winds up throwing out cheesy one liners that totally kill whatever atmosphere they've managed to cultivate. 

Flag is the buddy of the DM's that doesn't really play, but agreed to play the PC with the relationship with the BBEG to give the plot a hook, but only if he could play a ""normal"" guy as a character cause he thinks the rest of the group is a bunch of nerds.

Harley Quinn is the only girl at the table. Not actually there to play, just interested in getting attention from the male players by playing a really sexual character, but also acts like a total loon to keep them from getting any ideas that she's genuinely interested in them. 

Joker is the NPC the DM invented on the fly to try and keep Harley's player invested in the game. She doesn't care, and he winds up being a total mess of a character with all of the subtlety of a dump truck.

El Diablo is the guy who refuses to do anything to contribute to the success of the party in combat, because of reasons involving his character being tragic and edgy. When the others call him out, he shrugs and says, ""It's just what my character would do.""

Killer Croc is the guy browsing 4chan on his phone the whole time, looking up only to roll for an attack and say, ""Uh, yeah, I, uh...I'm a lizard guy. I eat people."" before going back to his phone.

Slipknot was the guy who tries to break the setting by going against the plot for no reason. DM kills him out of frustration, the player gets pissed and goes home. 

Captain Boomerang is actually a pretty decently built character, but his player gives him a pink unicorn fetish and an Australian accent to piss off the DM. Keeps bringing it up at weird times.

Katana is that weird guy who's SUPER into anime. Insists on playing a girl, and got all of his attributes from some weird Asian themed rulebook he ordered online from Europe that is actually for a different game. Again, DM allows it for some reason. Refuses to speak English during any roleplay.

The entire plot of the movie, from the Enchantress easily stealing the idol with her brother in it from Viola Davis, to the bland generic minions, to the evil sexy wiggling before the final battle, to every superhero movie clich√©, is the DM trying out that homebrew game he wrote that he was super excited about, then realizing as it goes on that he is actually woefully unprepared and the party is not working with him, so he proceeds to phone it in and just get it to be over with so he can go write Version 2.

The soundtrack is the DM's iPod on shuffle in the background. Is actually the MVP of the game.

EDIT: So people are right, Harley and Katana should be switched, Katana is a girl super into anime, Harley is actually a guy playing a psycho chick. But I'm not changing it, so just imagine whichever is funnier, IDGAF.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x115699fd0>,rpg,1470719082.0
1hw5on3,"To people who started their RPG journey with D&D, what made you finally play something else?","I'm old.  My journey began with AD&D 1E. To me, it was the perfect system. Never even wanted to look at another system. Not even another TSR product. SO many great games I missed out on because of stubborness.

Then I went to college and found a new gaming group. They were moving from AD&D to Call of Cthulhu.  Well, I didn't want to. Why mess with perfection? But my choice was to either play CoC or not play with my friends.

I actually planned to sabotage the game so we could get back to AD&D. But I REALLY liked CoC. I figured by session 3, I could do something to derail the whole thing and then we could get back to the far superior AD&D. Problem is, by the end of session 2, I was hooked enough to buy the CoC hardback.

And I'm more than happy to hop between game systems now and have been doing so since that session in 1990 when they forced me to play CoC.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1151181d0>,rpg,1736293419.0

1geu8aw,"A response to ""polishing same stone"" thread from the perspective of indie RPG creator","This is a direct response to the post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1gbxlye/can\_we\_stop\_polishing\_the\_same\_stone/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1gbxlye/can_we_stop_polishing_the_same_stone/)

I am the author of an indie-rpg called **Slay the Dragon!** and today it came to my attention that my game has been used to start a heated argument which went as far as the post being tweeted by Indestructoboy. I am writing this to share a perspective of a creator being on the receiving end of the stick because and also to share why I think that rhetoric presented by OP is actively harmful to what he wants to achieve.

**By being oblivious to the context, you are actively discouraging foreign authors from attempts to publish abroad.**¬†

In certain countries such as Poland where I come from the access to D&D is not as easy as in USA. It might be expensive, it might be hard to get, and it might not be available in the local language altogether. I created Slay the Dragon to be affordable, have a box set form and be easily accessible due to the generic fantasy theme. The game was warmly received, so I decided to share it with the international audience. By being ignorant to that context and claiming it‚Äôs just another unnecessary take on D&D, you are making it harder for us to do it.¬†

**Instead of complaining about D&D, give few indie games a real shot and you might actually see that a lot of them are more similar to the games you mentioned as ones you like.**¬†

Everything will be D&D if you are so desperate to see it everywhere. I won‚Äôt deny, yes my game is about dungeon crawling, yest it uses the popular d20 die and yes it is written with generic fantasy in mind. But it is also so much more. It actually makes dungeon exploration a mechanic within the game. And it binds this mechanic with combat and other parts of the game via the system of abstract resources. Resources that are abstract in order to bring a little bit of the joy of spontaneous creativity from story games into it. But to get all of that, you actually need to read into the game. Please do not make superficial judgments, just to have something to complain about.

**The post as the one that started the conversation might be enough to bury a project such as us together with all the love and work we gave it.**¬†

It‚Äôs incredibly hard to be an indie creator as it is. For me, publishing my games is a way of sharing results of a process I love. My game didn‚Äôt start as a scheme to make a quick buck. Me and the illustrator of the game who is a dear friend of mine wanted to create something together, and so we did. Hundreds of hours later, we had something we were proud of. But that‚Äôs only a small part of the battle, as we have to reach an audience. And without marketing resources to rival corporations or being in the inner circle of people who like to fashion themselves indie-rpg content creators, it‚Äôs really hard task. So please, for the love of god, think about the consequence of your actions.

1iqxzqn,What‚Äôs been the most high-quality RPG product you‚Äôve backed on Kickstarter? What‚Äôs been the worst?,"I‚Äôve backed over 200 different things on Kickstarter over the years, and have experienced a great number of highs and lows. 

In RPG terms, the various ***City Of Mist*** sets from Son Of Oak studio are of *immense* quality, the physical books and supplements in particular. The depth of the setting and adventures and quality of the tools and such are great. It‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs a relatively difficult game to get a group to try, cause I‚Äôd be on it all the time otherwise. Not the cheapest, but I definitely felt the price had been earned. 

The worst was a ‚Äòmurder mystery‚Äô adventure about a group of women whose husbands had disappeared - blatant and *low*-quality AI art, poorly machine-translated English text, and a dull, non-sensical mystery that flat-out didn‚Äôt work if you spent even a minute thinking about it.

OP: I want a relatively simple, fast playing, but still tactical RPG, that doesn't use classes, and is good for modern combat. The player characters will be surviving a zombie apocalypse, kind of like the movie Zombieland.

Reply 1: Clearly, what you want is OSR. Have you tried Worlds Without Number? It uses classes, but we'll just ignore that part of your question.

Reply 2: For some reason, I ignored the fact that you asked for an RPG with tactical depth, and I'm going to suggest FATE .

Reply 3. Since you asked for simplicity, I will suggest a system that requires you to make 500 zillion choices at first level for character creation, and requires you to track 50 million trillion separate status effects with overlapping effects: Pathfinder 2E. After all, a role-playing system that has 640 pages of core rules and 42 separate status effects certainly falls under simple, right?

Reply 4: MORK BORG.

Reply 5: You shouldn't be caring about tactical combat, use Powered by the Apocalypse.

Reply 6: You cited Zombieland, a satirical comedy, as your main influence, so I am going to suggest Call of Cthulhu, a role playing game about losing your mind in the face of unspeakable cosmic horrors.

Reply 7: Savage Worlds. You always want Savage Worlds. Everything can be done in Savage Worlds. There is no need for any other system than Savage Worlds.

Reply 8: Maybe you can somehow dig up an ancient copy of a completely out of print RPG called ""All Flesh Must be Eaten.""

Reply 9: GURPS. The answer is GURPS. Everything can be done in GURPS. There is no need for any other system aside from GURPS.

1eowcxi,"I'm Andrew Fischer, Lead Designer for the Cosmere RPG. AMA!","Hello, r/rpg! I'm **Andrew Fischer**, lead designer on the **Cosmere Roleplaying Game**.¬†

I‚Äôve worked on RPGs and other tabletop games for 15 years. I‚Äôve led development on tabletop games such as the *Star Wars RPG*, the *Warhammer 40k RPG*, and *Fallout*.

I also worked for many years to pioneer a genre of app-integrated board games that combine physical and digital game systems in products like *Mansions of Madness 2nd edition*, *Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle Earth*, and *Descent: Legends of the Dark*.

When I‚Äôm not designing for the Cosmere, I work as the game design director at [Earthborne Games](https://earthbornegames.com/), a studio focused on creating conscientious and sustainable games such as our critically-acclaimed debut title [Earthborne Rangers](https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos/review-earthborne-rangers/).

# The Cosmere RPG

The [Cosmere RPG](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brotherwise/the-stormlight-archive-rpg) is an original tabletop roleplaying system that encompasses the entire universe of Brandon Sanderson's best-selling novels. While the core mechanic is familiar (d20 + modifier), it's full of twists like the plot die, freeform leveling, skill-based invested powers, meaningful systems for non-combat scenes, and more! The game is launching in 2025 with the Stormlight setting and expands to include Mistborn in 2026, with a steady rollout of new worlds and adventures for years to come!

Our Kickstarter launched last Tuesday has blown us away with the response! Not only can you back the project now, but you can check out our open beta rules at any of the following locations:

* Download the 90-page [Beta Rules Preview](https://legacy.drivethrurpg.com/product/489715/Cosmere-RPG--Beta-Rules-Preview) and [Bridge Nine](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/489721/Bridge-Nine--Cosmere-RPG) tutorial adventure
* Explore talent trees and build your own character on [Demiplane](https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/cosmererpg)
* Download free VTT modules via [Roll20](https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/bundle/32771/cosmere-rpg-bridge-nine-adventure-playset) and [Fantasy Grounds](https://forge.fantasygrounds.com/shop/items/1865/view)
* Join sessions run by professional GMs on [StartPlaying.Games](http://startplaying.games/)

So let's answer your questions! Feel free to ask anything, though I won't be able to answer everything. I'm happy to answer questions about the design and development of the system, the content of the game itself, what it's like to work with Dragonsteel, what it's like to work on tabletop games, and more. To keep the questions as open as possible, this thread will have **spoilers** for all published novels in Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere.

Thanks for having me, let‚Äôs dive in!

**UPDATE:** Thanks for so many amazing questions! I think I'm going to wrap it up there. If you have additional questions, feel free to head on over to the [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brotherwise/the-stormlight-archive-rpg) and ask them in the comments section there.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11511aff0>,rpg,1723305375.0

lmmasq,"REMINDER: Just because this sub dislikes D&D doesn't mean you should avoid it. In fact, it's a good RPG to get started with!","People here like bashing D&D because its popularity is out of proportion with the system's quality, and is perceived as ""taking away"" players from their own pet system, but it is not a bad game. The ""crunch"" that often gets referred to is by no means overwhelming or unmanageable, and in fact I kind of prefer it to many ""rules-light"" systems that shift their crunch to things that, IMO, shouldn't have it (codifying RP through dice mechanics? Eh, not a fan.)

Honestly, D&D is a great spot for new RPG players to start and then decide where to go from. It's about middle of the road in terms of crunch/fluff while remaining easy to run and play, and after playing it you can decide ""okay that was neat, but I wish there were less rules getting in the way"", and you can transition into Dungeon World, or maybe you think that fiddling with the mechanics to do fun and interesting things is more your speed, and you can look more at Pathfinder. Or you can say ""actually this is great, I like this"", and just keep playing D&D.

Beyond this, D&D is a massively popular system, which is a **strength**, not a reason to avoid it. There is an abundance of tools and resources online to make running and playing the system easier, a wealth of free adventures and modules and high quality homebrew content, and many games and players to actually play the game with, which might not be the case for an Ars Magica or Genesys. For a new player without an established group, this might be the single most important argument in D&D5E's favor. 

So don't feel like you have to avoid D&D because of the salt against it on this sub. D&D 5E is a good system. Is it the best system? I would argue there's no single ""best"" system except the one that is best for you and your friends, and D&D is a great place to get started finding that system.

A long-time GM of mine, whom I played multiple years-long games under, moved to a different city as of late. They actually switched to DMing 5e as a system, and plan on sticking with it, because they find 5e to be a vastly superior platform for meeting and establishing rapport with new people and communities. Even one of the ""more successful"" non-5e RPGs, like *Pathfinder* 2e, is significantly worse as a platform for forging new social bonds, let alone a more obscure system.

This applies both in real life and online. 5e players and 5e communities are supremely more accessible and bustling than those of any other RPG.

I‚Äôve read through the pdf and played with some characters, and holy fuck this game is good. The racial system of managing different modular traits is really sick, and the martial classes in this game are actually really good. Also it‚Äôs about bugs, which is based.

It‚Äôs got a really great action economy system with stamina, a resource used to make attacks. Each character has 3 stamina plus 1 for each level in a martial path. You use stamina for attacks, dodging, extra movement, and more. Each attack will cost more stamina for every attack you have already made this turn, so action economy doesn‚Äôt spiral out of control. Your stamina regenerates at the start of each turn

The stamina system achieves a couple of things:

1. It makes martials more defensive, since they have more resources to dodge with

2. It give more strategy in combat, since there is a trade off between defensive stamina use and spending stamina on offence

3. I allows casters more nuanced and balanced control options. Instead of binary save of suck options, most spells will instead drain stamina from enemies, like one spell that grapples targets with vines, with it costing 2 stamina to attempt an escape.

Did I mention natural weapons are good and varied in this game, it has a good alchemist class, a good trap based class, and a good poison based class?


This game has all the things I wish that other chunky RPGs like dnd had.

Even if you‚Äôve never played hollow knight, this is worth checking out.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1170632f0>,rpg,1664457500.0
18wnpg7,MCDM RPG about to break $4 million,"Looks they‚Äôre about to break 4 million. I heard somewhere that Matt wasn‚Äôt as concerned with the 4 million goal as he was the 30k backers goal. His thought was that if there weren‚Äôt 30k backers then there wouldn‚Äôt be enough players for the game to take off. Or something like that. Does anyone know what I‚Äôm talking about? I‚Äôve been following this pretty closely on YouTube but haven‚Äôt heard him mention this myself.

I know a lot of people are already running the rules they put out on Patreon and the monsters and classes and such. The goal of 30k backers doesn‚Äôt seem to jive with that piece of data. Seems like a bunch of people are already enthusiastic about playing the game.

I‚Äôve heard some criticism as well, I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt be for everyone. Seems like this game will appeal to people who liked 4th edition?

Now, I have no problem when an author chooses to do so, but it is thoroughly dishonest and misleading when they list themselves as the artist in the credits section when you can tell the images were done by a program. Hands do not look right, weapons are held the wrong way, the outfits worn by two different people merge together, and a host of other small details show the picture is not right.

I know that PDFs are way more accessible with the advent of places like DriveThruRPG, but for the life of me, I just cannot read PDFs for rulebooks when compared to a physical book.

I don't know what it is, maybe it's OCD or like a focus thing, but there is a world of difference when I'm reading a book on a screen as opposed to reading it in print.  With PDFs, I just really can't focus of stay interested, something tangible is missing. 

The problem is that this had led to situations where I feel like I can't fully enjoy or play games like Rogue Trader or other older games because I need a print copy of the book, and of course lots of out of print stuff is expensive.  So in order to try these games, I feel I have to track down and buy these pricey books in order to physically have them.

l4ynmz,I Don't See How D&D 5e Is a Great RPG for Beginners,"I don't understand how 5e is supposed to be a beginner's game. It's ridiculously verbose and complex, while simultaneously severely lacking in actual content. The core rules are over 1,000 pages spread across 3 different books, and the system is riddled with contradictions and exceptions to the core rule system. And every class essentially feels like it was randomly copy-pasted from multiple separate games, running on different subsystems which further jumble and contradict the core rules of 5e. It's a mammoth task to wrap one's head around for the first time, especially if you've never even played an RPG before.

How exactly is 5e any better or easier for newcomers then, say, Old School Essentials, or Shadow of the Demon Lord? Both of which are far more streamlined and easier to grasp.

As far as I can tell, the only reason people laud 5e as a ""great gateway"" to the hobby is because of its popularity. Which, essentially, is a self fulfilling paradox. It's popular because everyone keeps saying it is. It's got nothing to do with the mechanics at all.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1171002f0>,rpg,1611611791.0

1f0ujq6,The Cosmere RPG base system is everything I wanted from 5.5,"1. It has horizontal character progression: more choices instead of just raw power upgrades.
2. An easy narrative Goals and Rewards system.
3. It's skill-based and allows eclectic or specialized characters by default, including any combination of ""multi-classing"".
4. Makes Initiative a player choice that can be either tactical or narrative-based. (Inspired by Shadow of the Demon Lord)
5. Makes basic Reactions impactful, with plenty of choices and uses.
6. ""Focus"" as a limited resource gives you many options of maneuvers or bonus effects with a balanced cost.
7. They solved the oh-no-hit-so-I-do-nothing turn of dnd martials with ""Graze"" (I don't know if it's new, but it's the first time I see it), so hitting is not only luck-based (you normally succeed on your Strike), but resource-based (if you fail at the Strike, just pay 1 focus to deal your damage-die damage as if you hit, without any damage bonus). Missing and still dealing damage at a cost feels great.
8. An easy and immediate Opportunities and Consequences system that does it's job when needed, without complex gimmicks or hindering the base rolls.
9. It's familiar enough that it's easily picked up, and doesn't alienate players.
10. Only rolling once per test with whatever dice you have to roll (d20 + Damage Die + Plot Die if needed) really makes for fast combats.
11. The Injury system promotes players overcoming challenges and character-story progression, while not heavily penalizing combat or risking easy character death, even at level 1.
12. The Recovery Die keeps resources (health and focus) tight, but still rechargable once per scene.

I also find the respect they've shown to GMs really refreshing; especially the attention they've shown to the Adversaries, with special Traits and Abilities that fit their role and play great at the table (even little details, like the Warform War-pairs moving together with a Reaction is just *chef's kiss*, such an easy way to represent their relationship and coordination). You can easily recognize that some people that worked on Flee Mortals! are also working on this project.

I can see myself home-brewing traditional fantasy Paths just to use it outside the Cosmere, and as far as Roshar is concerned they're doing a great job at adapting the Surges for what we've seen.

I also am aware that while that seems likely, this is sometimes used as an attack on RPG safety tools, which is a dumb strawman attack and not the point of this point.  
What is the point of this post is that, yeah, the BDSM community is generally pretty good about communication, consent, and safety. There is another lesson we can take from the BDSM community. No kink-shaming, in our case, no genre-shaming, system-shaming, playstyle-shaming, and so on. We can all have our preferences, we can know what we like and don't like, but that means, don't participate in groups doing the things you don't like or playing the games that are not for you.

1igs4um,"Do you personally find that online communities increase the pressure to fall in line with the ""community consensus"" on how a given RPG is ""supposed"" to be run and played?","Any given tabletop RPG can be only so comprehensive. There will always be facets of the rules, and practices on how to actually run and play the game, that the books simply do not cover.

Almost invariably, online communities for any given tabletop RPG will gradually devise a loose ""community consensus"" on how the game is ""supposed"" to be run and played. Yes, there will always be disagreements on certain points, but the ""community consensus"" will nevertheless agree on several key topics, even though the books themselves never actually expound on said subjects. This is most visible in subreddits for individual RPGs, where popular opinions get updooted into the hundreds or thousands, while unpopular stances get downvoted and buried; but the phenomenon is also present in a subtler form in Discord servers and in smaller boards.

To me, it feels like the ideal of ""There is no inherently right or wrong way to play a given system"" goes right out the window when someone mentions that they are running and playing the game a certain way, only for other people to come along and say something like ""Yeah, but that is not really how most people play the game"" (i.e. ""You are playing the game wrong""). What matters most, is, ultimately, whether or not the individual group prefers to run and play the game a certain way, but it sure does not feel like it when discussing a game online.

___

I would like to add that I personally find that there is a fine yet very important distinction between ""what the book says"" (or does not say) and ""what the 'community consensus' **thinks** the book says.""

Ofttimes, I see someone claiming that ""You are doing it wrong; the book says so and so."" When I press that person to give a citation, they frequently cannot do so.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x12177b5f0>,rpg,1738597809.0

1f2mk7r,What RPG from the '90s do you think deserves more love today?,"Back in the 90s, I was deep into ttrpg. I was GM - and sometimes player - for two to three games a week for years. Then life happened and I stepped away for 20 years. Fast forward to covid, and like many others, I got back in ttrpg, rediscovering the hobby as if I‚Äôd just stepped out of a cryo-chamber decades in the future.

Against all expectations, playing ttrpgs remotely has been a surprisingly great experience for me. I've been amazed by the massive amount of indie games being published (and I can‚Äôt stop buying and reading them, even though I can‚Äôt possibly play them all). I‚Äôve also fallen in love with some amazing newer games (newer being a relative term in my situation!).

But after showing some of my old books to my son, I‚Äôve been feeling nostalgic and wanted to revisit some classics. And I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on games from the 90s that you think still deserve some love today.

I‚Äôll start with some of my favorites (as a GM):

**Rolemaster (1st and 2nd Editions):**  
Yes, this game earned the reputation of being way too complex, often referred to as ‚ÄúChartmaster‚Äù or ‚ÄúRulesmaster‚Äù. And yes, there are charts. So many charts. For instance, there‚Äôs one full page chart written in tiny font per weapon! There were also incredibly detailed and fun critical hit and fumble charts (we had fun just browsing through them with my players).

So many parameters and so much creativity were baked into the tables. To avoid browsing the rulebooks during my games I had a display book, a binder full of curated charts for every weapon my players or their enemies had.

Seven ‚Äúcompanion‚Äù rulebooks were released, packed with additional or alternative rules, more spells, more skills, more classes, more everything. I had them all, and I used maybe 5% of their content but I couldn‚Äôt stop browsing them and envisioning how each piece could fit in my campaign. I used this system to run my longest campaign during the whole decade, it still has such a nostalgic power over me.

**Paranoia (1st and 2nd Editions):**  
Paranoia was about chaos, death, and absurdity. And it was brilliant. The game was set in a dystopian underground city where The Computer controlled every aspect of life. The Computer, your ‚Äúbenevolent‚Äù overlord, assigned missions, and if you weren't paranoid about your colleagues betraying you to earn favor from The Computer, you were definitely doing something wrong.

One of the things that set Paranoia apart was the fact that your character started the game with six clones. Dying was part of the game. Death could alter the story, reveal secrets, and change the group dynamics. The game encouraged players to come up with the most ridiculous ways for their clones to die. And a lot of fun came from the constant suspicion, double-dealing, and nearly inevitable death.  The humor was dark and biting, and you had to embrace the absurdity to survive (or not!) each mission.

**TORG (1st Edition):**  
I think TORG was one of the most ambitious games of its time. It had this multi-genre, dimension-hopping setting where you could have anything from high fantasy knights battling cyberpunks from the future to pulp heroes fighting off dinosaurs from a lost world.

The game was built around the idea of different realities invading Earth, each one transforming parts of the world into its own unique realm. Each of these ‚ÄòCosms‚Äô had their own rules. For instance, magic could be powerful in one realm but completely useless in another. This dynamic made every game feel fresh and unpredictable.

TORG also included the Drama Deck, a card-based mechanic that added a lot of unpredictability to encounters and created a real cinematic vibe. Players could play cards to boost their actions, create dramatic moments, or turn the tide in unexpected ways. I think a lot of what TORG did was way ahead of its time.

What about you? What is your favorite rpg from the 90s you think deserve a second look today?

EDIT: Fair enough, maybe I should have said the 80s as Rolemaster and Paranoia were released in that decade.

I have a few dozen books. I really like the setting, the core rules, the combat.

I didn't like that it starts to break down ""late game"". At one point combat becomes so trivial, rolling dice is more of a dull exercise than an instrument of luck. You can't miss hots. Enemies can't harm you. Targets evaporate on hit. A clever GM can circumvent around this issue, but it requires significant effort and is easy to slip into it.

The game stopped being my favorite since most new books containing equipment and rules, were bad. They were inconsistent with the core rules (exceptions, conflicts, confusion). They were broken (overpowered or useless), or needlessly elaborate. Even the Companion, which otherwise was a good book, had such bad ones. Some additions were so bad, they seemed like they weren't even played out on a piece of paper, not even mentioning playtested.

This got me annoyed over time to the point I preferred playing other games.

So, what was your favorite game, and why it's no longer?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x120fa92b0>,rpg,1667483249.0
1iez8zj,US Tariffs and RPG book prices,"I thought it might be a good idea for us Americans to know where RPG are printed to know if tariffs might impact book prices.

Here is what I compiled from going through my bookshelf. This is for RPG book products only.

Wizards of the Coast - USA

Troll Lord Games -USA

Paizo - China

Chaosium - Poland

Steve Jackson Games - USA

R Talsorian Games - Canada

Modiphius - Lithuania

 Evil Hat - USA

The Arcane Library - China

Please note. I am not trying to make a political statement. I‚Äôm really pointing out that books printed outside the United States may suddenly cost more inside the United States and it would be a good idea to know that. I assume all books currently sitting on the shelf and in warehouses are going to stay the same price, but if a book sells out and a new print run is ordered, there‚Äôs a very good chance it may cost a little bit more than it did before. 

Please add to the list.

If you‚Äôre looking to buy a rather pricey book, it may be better to get it now than wait 6 months. Also, if publishers try to switch to a US publisher, there may be delays with everyone doing it.

This list is compiled from the books I own. Publishers may use more than one printer. I don‚Äôt know that. I can only tell you what I see on the back and the inside covers of the books that I own.

I hope someone finds this useful. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x12237b4d0>,rpg,1738387102.0

18ibj22,Hasbro's Struggle with Monetization and the Struggle for Stable Income in the RPG Industry,"We've been seeing reports coming out from Hasbro of their mass layoffs, but buried in all the financial data is the fact that Wizards of the Coast itself is seeing its revenue go up, but the revenue increases from Magic the Gathering (20%) are larger than the revenue increase from Wizards of the Coast as a whole (3%), suggesting that Dungeons and Dragons is, yet again, in a cycle of losing money.

Large layoffs have already happened and are occurring again.

It's long been a fact of life in the TTRPG industry that it is hard to make money as an independent TTRPG creator, but spoken less often is the fact that it is hard to make money in this industry period. The reason why Dungeons and Dragons belongs to WotC (and by extension, Hasbro) is because of their financial problems in the 1990s, and we seem to be seeing yet another cycle of financial problems today.

One obvious problem is that there is a poor model for recurring income in the industry - you sell your book or core books to people (a player's handbook for playing the game as a player, a gamemaster's guide for running the game as a GM, and maybe a bestiary or something similar to provide monsters to fight) and then... well, what else can you sell? Even amongst those core three, only the player's handbook is needed by most players, meaning that you're already looking at the situation where only maybe 1 in 4 people is buying 2/3rds of your ""Core books"".

Adding additional content is hit and miss, as not everyone is going to be interested in buying additional ""splatbooks"" - sure, a book expanding on magic casters is cool if you like playing casters, but if you are more of a martial leaning character, what are you getting? If you're playing a futuristic sci-fi game, maybe you have a book expanding on spaceships and space battles and whatnot - but how many people in a typical group needs that? One, probably (again, the GM most likely).

Selling adventures? Again, you're selling to GMs.

Selling books about new races? Not everyone feels the need to even have those, and even if they want it, again, you can generally get away with one person in the group buying the book.

And this is ignoring the fact that piracy is a common thing in the TTRPG fanbase, with people downloading books from the Internet rather than actually buying them, further dampening sales.

The result is that, after your initial set of sales, it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain your game, and selling to an ever larger audience is not really a plausible business model - sure, you can expand your audience (D&D has!) but there's a limit on how many people actually want to play these kinds of games.

So what is the solution for having some sort of stable income in this industry?

We've seen WotC try the subscription model in the past - Dungeons and Dragon 4th edition did the whole D&D insider thing where DUngeon and Dragon magazine were rolled in with a bunch of virtual tabletop tools - and it worked well enough (they had hundreds of thousands of subscribers) but it also required an insane amount of content (almost a book's worth of adventures + articles every month) and it also caused 4E to become progressively more bloated and complicated - playing a character out of just the core 4E PHB is way simpler than building a character is now, because there were far fewer options.

And not every game even works like D&D, with many more narrative-focused games not having very complex character creation rules, further stymying the ability to sell content to people.

So what's the solution to this problem? How is it that a company can set itself up to be a stable entity in the RPG ecosystem, without cycles of boom and bust? Is it simply having a small team that you can afford when times are tight, and not expanding it when times are good, so as to avoid having to fire everyone again in three years when sales are back down? Is there some way of getting people to buy into a subscription system that doesn't result in the necessary output stream corroding the game you're working on?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122936b10>,rpg,1702568891.0
yyigtk,Transformers rpg is honestly kind of heartbreaking [rant],"So I finally got my physical copy of the Transformers RPG last week after pre-ordering it back in February. I was fully aware of what it would be: a kind of low-effort 5E hack with slightly different terminology. But I was fine with that, I rarely run games RAW so I was prepared to tweak and hack and house rule. I figured that there'd be a decent skeleton to work with. Plus I love Transformers: I'm not just some GeeWun nostalgia blinded casual fan, I've kept pace with the franchise for years and love both the deep lore and the great potential for storytelling the franchise has.

I thought it would be *fine.*

But to paraphrase Prime from the banging Cybertron theme, OUR GAMES ARE IN DANGER

(disclaimer, this is all my opinion, if you like the Essence system/5E, good for you, my dislike doesn't invalidate your preferences)

Firstly this book is just a mess in terms of layout. You have to get about 120 pages in before it starts actually explaining rules, so chances are you waded through a bunch of character stuff with zero context for what any of it means. Then usual bloat of more character options and combat rules. Then 80ish pages of enemy statblocks. You want advice how to actually structure and run a game? Here's like four paragraphs they vaguely talk about doing an equal mix of combat, exploration, and social interaction. OKAY COOL THANKS CHAMP.

Alt mode rules aren't awful. I was dreading this but they make the smart choice of generalising vehicle types. But ffs some of the language/terminology choice is so bad. Your alt mode is your ""Origin""? A tank alt mode is a ""Rainmaker""? Oh and no rules for beast modes. We can apparently have a fifth of the book be statblocks but can't have dedicate a page for covering beast mode alt modes - sorry, Origin - rules. Got to have something for the supplemental books I guess.

Characters are just 5E copy paste jobs. 20 levels, with multiple small perks because that's what D&D does so we should do it too! üëç The list of skills is the same. Why the fuck does my Transformers game have Animal Handling and Performance skills in it? Going to be rolling lots of acting checks are we? Is that the intended tone for the game? I have to guess because the GM advice is aggressively minimal. 

I have a bunch of other gripes but I just wanted to get all that out now. Honestly stay away from this one, it's a wreck. But not the cool Wreck 'N' Rule type, the bad kind. 

The good thing is that it's inspired me to start writing my own game based on Unity's ruleset as I think that fits Transformers better.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x122a7f2f0>,rpg,1668773026.0

1ja9fh4,How much does an RPG actively getting new releases affect your interest and ability to play or run the game?,"The grid-based tactical RPGs I have been playing and running the most over the past several months are *D&D* 4e, *Path*/*Starfinder* 2e, *D&D* 2024/2025 (if it can even be called ""grid-based tactics""), *Draw Steel!*, and level2janitor's *Tactiquest*. *Draw Steel!* has yet to fully release, and level2janitor's *Tactiquest* is an indie game still in playtest, so I will set those aside for the following subject.

Between *D&D* 4e, *Path*/*Starfinder* 2e, and *D&D* 2024/2025, my favorite to play and run is *D&D* 4e by far, then *Path*/*Starfinder* 2e in distant second, then *D&D* 2024/2025 in an extremely distant last place. Despite this, of the games mentioned above, *D&D* 4e is the one I have been least active with (not too much, though, seeing how I played a session just a few days ago), simply because it is not getting new releases.

Conversely, *Path*/*Starfinder* 2e and *D&D* 2024/2025 are, in fact, getting new releases, which spark my interest and entice me to read through their mechanics: to the point wherein I have stepped up to DM a game of 2024/2025 to give it an earnest try, despite me finding its PC mechanics and its monster designs dishearteningly boring compared to *Path*/*Starfinder* 2e (and especially compared to *D&D* 4e, which I highly value the PC mechanics and monster designs of).

I read the quickstart and mostly understood the rules, but my understanding of PbtA games is that they are heavily reliant on player agency and players understanding the mechanics and their options, and none of my players came prepared.

Partially due to my inexperience and partially due to that of my players, I ran an entire session of Avatar without any balance actions or combat (lack of combat was largely on them, but I could have found opportunities to force it; maybe I should have interpreted more of their social roleplay as balance actions?). It was all basic actions/skill checks. With very minor modifiers, this basically means the whole session was basically just coin flips to see if an action succeeded.

1erbtmr,"How long does it take to publish your own RPG by yourself? 8 years, turns out! AMA!","Hi there. My name is Josh McCrowell, and for the last 8 years I wrote a game called *[His Majesty the Worm](http://hismajestytheworm.games/)*. It came out last month!

I'm holding a public AMA here to celebrate the release of the game and hold a retrospective about my experiences getting a book to print without traditional publishing or crowdfunding support.

### What's His Majesty the Worm?

*His Majesty the Worm* is a new-school game with old-school sensibilities: the classic megadungeon experience given fresh life through a focus on the mundanities and small moments of daily life inside the dungeon. Food, hunger, light, and inventory management are central to play and actually fun. Tarot cards are used to create an action-packed combat system that ensures that all players have interesting choices every minute of combat: no downtime! If you like things like Dungeon Meshi or Rat Queens, you might find something fun in this game.

You can learn more about the game, and find links to buy either the physical or digital editions, on our [website](http://hismajestytheworm.games/)! **Preview chapters** (over 100 pages of content) are hosted on our Itch page, which is also linked from the site. 

(When it launched, the physical edition sold out within 3 hours. ~~The books are now restocked at Exalted Funeral!~~ Whoops just sold out again. Sorry about that! You can sign up to be notified of the restocks on Exalted Funeral's website.)

### How did you publish it?

Essentially, I worked one day a week on Sundays. I wrote the outline of a game and playtested it with friends. 

I have a lot of skepticism around the way games are currently crowdfunded, and knew I wanted to avoid running my own Kickstarter campaign. Instead, I used **Itchfunding** to fund art, editing, graphic design, layout, copyediting, and other things I can't do by myself. 

I put sample chapters, with very rough layout and art, onto Itch. Mostly, these were put up as pay-what-you-will (PWYW). Every time I accumulated enough scratch to pay somebody (e.g., commission a single piece of art), I did so. 

Part of the above process was doing a lot of self-driven marketing. I can talk about that too.

When the book was basically done, I shopped around for someone to print it for me. Eventually, Exalted Funeral agreed to publish it for me and split the printing fees. Now it's out! Hooray!

So if you want to chat about the process of independently publishing your own game or learn more about the Worm, please ask me anything! 

~~I'll be answering questions from 12:00 pm EST to 5 pm EST.~~

**Update:** Thanks so much for your questions and support, y'all. I need to step away now. During this AMA, *His Majesty the Worm* sold out (again!). You can sign up for my newsletter to be notified of restocks at the website: http://hismajestytheworm.games/

15iy726,"Unpopular Opinion: For me, nothing ruins an awesome and unique looking independent RPG campaign/setting product than the words ""5e Compatible"".","I believe that D&D 5e does heroic fantasy well, but not much else. The exploration and social mechanics, touted as 2 of 3 of the main game pillars, are almost non-existent - skill checks with a sliding scale of success are pretty much the limit of what is achieved in core 5e. Heroic-tier notwithstanding, 5e is not even that good at combat - and I say this as somebody who has had fun playing it regularly since 2012. Gritty combat, epic fantasy, unarmed combat - the list goes on -  do not work in core 5e without some major home-brewing and overhauling.

Despite this, every other product I see advertised seems to try and shoehorn itself into D&D 5e to cash in on its popularity. I see ads for Souls-like settings, a Pacific Rim TTRPG, Lovecraftian horror, JRPG school sims, medieval battle games, etc. and so many of them are confining themselves to the 5e system when there are thousands of other systems out there that do what they want to achieve far better. 

To me, if a developer is creating 5e compatible product that isn't some spin on heroic fantasy, then they have either not researched enough TTRPG systems or are cashing in on 5e's success.

Is it a cardinal sin to want your non-heroic fantasy product to be successful? No, of course not. But I am confident that your product will suffer if you stuff it into the framework of a system that doesn't suit it.

Edit: Leaving it up so that others who search can avoid the mistake I made. It turns out that this is, in fact, a popular opinion.Thanks for the flair, Moderator!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1259ba810>,rpg,1691248371.0

17op1bc,Are we returning to a less D&D dominant RPG scene?,"Dungeons and Dragons is huge. There‚Äôs no denying that. And while the TTRPG industry has experienced a ‚Äúrising tide lifts all ships‚Äù moment, D&D remains, by likely orders of magnitude, the biggest game in the industry. 



But the cracks are showing. Backlash and fatigue against products was shaking even in 2019. Now the the OGL fiasco, the Pinkerton incident, and the confusing ‚ÄúOneD&D rollout‚Äù community sentiment has never been more critical of wizards of the coast. Of course, I‚Äôm basing this on discourse I see on Reddit and Twitter; places known to be loud echo chambers that rarely represent an actual community. That being said, dungeons and dragons players are likely more online than in other communities, and so the critical voices might represent a larger plurality of places than we think. 



I don‚Äôt think D&D is remotely close to dying. There is no ‚ÄúD&D killer‚Äù on the horizon. I will also say this subreddit IS an echo chamber- the Ironsworns and FitD and Delta Greens are not the games that will be the ones peeling major numbers off of D&D. But there are games coming that I think will take larger shares of the casual ttrpg fanbase. Pathfinder2e has already exploded in popularity in the last year. 


Major D&D 3rd party content companies Kobold Press and MCDM both of which have a lot of goodwill, are making their own systems. Critical Role, often attributed to be a major part of D&D5es success, with a massive fanbase, are also among those making a fantasy rpg competitor. 



Is it possible we are returning to eras like the mid-late 1990s and early 2010s where D&D is no longer the clear dominant ttrpg? Is this all conjecture? 



I am curious what people think. And please, I don‚Äôt wanna see just see tired D&D-bashing, we‚Äôve beaten that horse to a pulp.


Edit: I want to be really clear- I don‚Äôt think D&D will ever not be dominant, I am just curious if people think it will be less dominant, and what it would take for the industry to change ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x125ada9f0>,rpg,1699227187.0

1h8v6uq,All I Want for Christmas is a Fantasy RPG that Ticks All Our Boxes.,"Hi everyone, this is a hell of an ask, because it begets so many questions, clarifications, and backstory. 

So, my partner and I have struggled for years to find a good system to play 1 on 1, after we had done so in 3.5/PF1 as newbies 11 years ago. As I got tired of all the bloat, we experimented and they wanted to bring their beloved characters into something else, so the kitchen sink fantasy (as controversal as it tends to be) is kind of our thing. We tried 5e, PF2e, Shadow of the Weird Wizard, and Cypher System. While their was plenty to like about all of them, there were particular instances of each that my partner didn't enjoy: 
- 5e, vancian casting, wonk challenge ratings, lack of choice

- Pf2e: Holy friggen rules and blocks of text, Batman, and vancian casting

- Cypher System: Depending on what you play, you may feel mechanically flimsy early on and the cypher focus felt off.

- Shadow of the Weird Wizard: Found it overall lack luster

Most recently, I tried designing a Cortex Prime  based set of rules but just couldn't get it right.

A rough description: It sounds like option rich, light to mid crunch with little to track would be the right direction with a narrative focus over simple tactics and nitty gritty of normal ttrpg combat. Systems that avoid proprietary dice preferred that can fit an original setting.

This may sound silly and picky but trying to play in our shared setting is a source of joy and important to us, so suggestions would be very, VERY appreciated. Thanks, and happy holidays, y'all.

UPDATE: You all have given me so much to work with, and I am really grateful! I also apologize to those of you who have undoubtedly been like, ""Get a load of this guy!"" Believe me, I genuinely wish there was a simple fix and have even wondered why the hell I am still trying. I have had a really productive talk with my partner about making some concessions and compromises that we can actually move in a direction with this thing we're passionate about, but can't seem to agree on. I personally have tried way more systems than my partner, and even (I won't say how or where) worked in game design for the better part of a few years, which gives me a bit of perspective that many of you have kindly reminded me of, and I admit some of this has been a fool's errand, no doubt. 

I'm currently looking at Savage Worlds, Chasing Adventure, and may need some good recommendations for Forged in the Dark stuff. Alas my beloved Genesys will never get off the ground with my partner, it's just a non-starter, I'm afraid. If anyone has tried Daggerheart, I'd love some input on that - if there's any experience, I know that's in the work. 

Lastly! If you're working on a game, please don't hesitate to mention it here - you burgeoning creators are awesome and doing things I wish I had the time and patience to do.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x126376570>,rpg,1733586356.0

Thus, I would like to ask, when have you ever read an rpg that was greatly different from what you were expecting, for better or worse? I'll start.

Worlds Without Number

What I expected: a fairly (and painfully) generic fantasy piece much like In Nomine's Stars without Number's treatment of that respective genre

What I got: Numenera pt. 2-- Iterum Boogaloo

Heroines of the Last Age

What I expected: fun fun happy cyborg cute catgirlz! also a painfully clumsy and low tech scifi """"coat of paint"""" game much like its already generic fantasy og game

What I got: millions/billions of years old scifi civilizations open world space opera complete with space magic also catgirls

Girls by Moonlight

What I expected: So this is Sailor Moon the game I guess?

What I got: epic examination of the magical girl genre across multiple major presentations; ie mecha pilot magical girls, weird cerebral dream conspiracy magical girls, etc.

Tales from the Loop/Things from the Flood

What I expected: 80s kids on bikes mysteries involving figuring out the weird local goings on in the creepy forest involving supernatural occurrences in the Midwest or New England

What I got: gonzo mad pulp science trip, save all time from collapsing as 10 year olds, encounter creatures from other planets, raise an interdimensional space dolphin, fight a T-rex summoned via time-bending electric piano, help abort an android's reality warping psychic baby, etc. also its set in Sweden

Lancer

What I expected: gritty in the trenches mud and lasers mechs action

What I got: pilot a reality-warping space magic mecha to punch ascending cyborg AI gods/magical fascist dictators/higher-universal meta-beings/plain old opportunistic warlords into submission in a galaxy caught between the promise of utopia and those who would tear it down

Termination Shock

What I expected: a gritty Soma/Alien-franchise style """"low/hard sf"""" game

What I got: an optimistic high scifi game, play the """"fledgeling race"""" in a galaxy full of more progressed civilizations up the proverbial tech tree; make your own path out there and/or find a way to fix your screwed-up dystopic home; also a cheeky exercise in """"taking the piss out of"""" certain poorly-conceived """"transhumanist"""" writings

The killer feature of a game like *Burning Wheel*, in my opinion, is its amazing experience system (Artha). Whenever I encounter any sort of progression system, I immediately compare it to Artha.

With *Star Trek Adventures* I've really found **Threat** and **Momentum** to be killer features, at least as a DM, that allow me to control the pace and flow of a game in interesting ways. I'd say that the **Light Side** and **Dark Side** counter/points in FFG *Star Wars* is another example of a killer feature.

I think about the hobby, look at the books, occasionally write characters and adventures, but cannot see myself playing them. The books have been stacking up. I'm trying to figure out if I should just move on. I have other hobbies and interests, but I'm afraid of giving up on this one for some reason.

I've tried popping into a few games stores over the years to observe and eventually pop into an RPGs. It didn't jive with me at all. I don't mean to be rude, but I couldn't relate to the folks there. Some were dressed up and acting which was not for me and the ones I tried talking to, I couldn't hold a casual conversation with or find anything relatable. I have a small group of friends but they mostly think gaming is too childish for them.

Is this relatable? Should I just be content with what I have and further realize the beauty of reading and writing? Should I suck it up and be brave and just jump into a game? Should I sell stacks of the books and just focus on my favorite?

1ftwbnf,What counts as play(test)ing a tactical combat RPG incorrectly?,"I have been doing playtesting for various RPGs that feature some element of tactical combat: *Pathfinder* 2e's upcoming releases, *Starfinder* 2e, *Draw Steel!*, *13th Age* 2e, and others.

I playtest these RPGs by, essentially, stress-testing them. There is one other person with me. Sometimes, I am the player, and sometimes, I am the GM, but either way, one player controls the entire party. The focus of our playtests is optimization (e.g. picking the best options possible), tactical play with full transparency of statistics on both sides (e.g. the player knows enemy statistics and takes actions accordingly, and the GM likewise knows PC statistics and takes actions accordingly), and generally pushing the game's math to its limit. If the playtest includes clearly broken or overpowered options, I consider it important to playtest and showcase them, because clearly broken or overpowered options are not particularly good for a game's balance. I am under the impression that most other people will test the game ""normally,"" with minimal focus on optimization, so I do something different.

I [frequently get told](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1ftgebr/my_feedback_on_the_13th_age_2e_gamma_playtest/) that it is wrong to playtest in such a way. ""You have a fundamental misunderstanding,"" ""The community strongly disagrees with you,"" ""You are being aggressive and unhelpful,"" ""You are destroying your validity,"" ""You are not supposed to take the broken options,"" and so on and so forth.

Is this actually a wrong way to playtest a game?

15mfiaf,Worst official rpg settings?,"So recently I've been flipping through some old rpgs in my possession when I became inspired to write this post.

Which officially published rpg settings do you consider to be the worst, whether because they're boring, because they're weird (and not in a good way), or because they're just unpleasant to run or to play in?

One example I'll give is Degenesis. It has a unique take on post-apocalyptic, but it suffers from a serious problem in actually describing the setting in any clear terms, to the point where the average GM will probably have to read the books 2-3 times to puzzle out the general overview (ironically the clearest view of pre-apocalypse events is given in the format of a 2-3 page long *timeline*... with whole paragraphs printed in annoyingly small font). And even then large swathes of the setting are basically """"and YOU get to figure out these poorly described yet also critically important to the metaplot plot threads!!11!""""

This isn't even touching the whole """"replacement theory"""" and """"the African menace"""" themes that are present throughout the book (the rpg also seems to assume the default pcs are post-apocalyptic white europeans), with sections on how after white colonizers stopped messing with Africa (mainly due to the meteor strike that caused the apocalypse), all Africa somehow united in a massive empire and are now trying to take over the last bastions of white people in Europe through slavery (uh....) and trade networks.

Another dishonorable mention is Dogs in the Vineyard, since I really can't think of a way to describe it other than """"alt!Wild West, but you're religious puritans who *also* happen to be the only legitimate law because instead of magic and crazy weirdness like some *other* alternate Wild West games, this is one where Mormonism took over America"""", which I think would get no buy-in from any group I typically play with.

As someone who was brought into tabletop RPGs through D&D 5e when it was released as a young teenager, my perspective and experience with tabletop RPGs are through a very homogenized neo-trad/modern and narrative-focused lens, tabletop RPGs as a mechanical backbone for collaborative stories and characters. For me and the majority of people around my age, this is the way we were taught to view RPGs, but it's honestly crazy how much the mindset and culture differed in the earlier days of the hobby.

During NYCC some years ago, I was at a panel about the history of D&D art, and during it, I met one of the nicest old men I've encountered. He used to be one of the players that would play in Gary Gygax's AD&D tournaments and the way he described them was simultaneously amazing and horrifying. The idea of competitive tabletop RPG gaming was intriguing enough as is, but the way he described how he played and the thought process at the table was such a treat, talking about ripping down adamantine doors and scrambling for every last piece of loot before their time was up.

For those who have been in the hobby for a long time, did you notice and/or experience shifting cultures in the hobby? Were you there for the rise (or fall) of any systems, like the big White Wolf boom of the 90s/early 2000s? Have you had any culture shocks when it comes to how the hobby has changed and expectations?

x9hpg0,I'm so tired of other RPG players (rant),"I wish I could GM without having to manage people. It's so hard and stressing not only finding people who play in the platform I want and in the language I want, but also weeding them out.

I've even tried to join games in another language/platform as both player and GM (in pbp format) but one thing or another never truly clicks. Un-moderated mary sues, obvious self inserts, dungeondelving west marches (not my cup of tea), lack of a cohesive theme other than ""generic be what you want dnd"" or people not obeying the theme (most famously by trying to insert shounen tropes everywhere), people recycling unfitting OCs or media characters (easily detectable and very infuriating), game has way too many children gloves on, etc.

Which brings me back to having me wanting to make a table so everything can be in the way I want, but then I'm too tired to open one.

c4d0a1,Controversial Opinion: Creating your own RPG is pretty easy and everyone should try it.,"One mantra that I hear tossed around here and on /r/RPGdesign is that you shouldn't try to make your own RPG unless you are very experienced and have played a lot of RPGs.

This is nonsense.

While playing a lot of RPGs is very helpful (I love reading how other people have solved difficult design problems) you definitely DON'T need to be some kind of expert to start designing. I run games with 10 year olds every week, and got them started on my game [Maze Rats](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197158/Maze-Rats?affiliate_id=379088). Within weeks, they were coming to me with stories of games that they had played at home, DMing for their parents and siblings.

In almost every case, they had immediately begun hacking the rules. One kid even stapled together his own blank pamphlet and had started writing down the rules he'd come up with. Mr. Milton had done it, so how hard could it be?

Did their rules have problems? Probably, but who cares? After a while they would discover those problems for themselves, figure out how to solve them, and *teach themselves game design in the process*.

The idea that RPG design is some ultra-arcane process whose secrets are reserved for only the most dedicated and obsessed RPG fans is *really dumb*. Your game does not need to do anything original. It does not need to solve a particular problem. It does not need to ""innovate"" or ""push the medium forward"". You and your friend just have to enjoy it, and you have to be willing to change course and make corrections as you go. 5th graders can do it. You can do it too.

In the early days of DnD, the assumption was that DMs were not only creating their own worlds and building their own megadungeons for players to explore, but also that everyone was gradually building up their own custom ruleset that worked for them (it was also kind of inevitable, given how confusing the OD&D rules were). Game Design was inextricably entangled with being a dungeon master. The modern perceived divisions between those roles is not healthy for the hobby, in my opinion. They're just rules! Nothing will happen if you make your own!

So make a heartbreaker! Recreate DnD all over again! Make some experimental monstrosity that breaks every rule of RPGs! Enjoy yourself and learn something in the process. No one can stop you.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1338342f0>,rpg,1561327707.0

Me: ""Oh yeah! And His Majesty the Wyrm, a tarot-based dungeon crawler with OSR sensibilities was supposed to come out. I'll swing on over and see about picking that up.""

""Forty dollars? I think I can swing that.""

""Oh. Looks like they're already sold out of the book and only have a pdf which costs...40 dollars? That must be a mistake. It must still be showing the cost of the book+pdf. I'll swing by later and see what the real price is.""

""Oh hey, reddit says there's a Christmas in July sale over at DriveThruRPG. I'll swing on over there and check it out.""

""Oh hey, look: His Majesty the Wyrm! And it's...40 dollars.""

But when you look at the list of artists, collaborators, and 400+ page count, is $40 for a pdf that unreasonable? Compared to academic publishing (grrr...Brill), it's a steal. And yet, for $40, I could pick up two books from larger RPG publishers that probably have even more art than His Majesty the Wyrm. But they have more sales volume, so books like HMtW might require an indie premium.

But I don't think I want to pay that premium. Not yet. It's about the dollar per page amount that Arden Vul is, and I waited for that to go on sale before I bought it. I think I'll do the same here.

1eq48t1,Traveller RPG Review: Mixed Feelings on a Complex Game,"# Traveller RPG Review

*Author‚Äôs Note:* *I use the word ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù in various forms throughout this review.* *When I say ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù* *I am referring to so-called Generic Roleplaying games. These are setting neutral games designed to be used for a variety of settings and play experiences. Examples include games like BRP, GURPs, Cypher, and Fate.*

One of the things you need learn if you intend succeed at an Academic‚Ñ¢, is that to write a good or interesting paper it is always best to limit your scope. Your chosen topic of expertise is always going to be infinitely complex and granular. Arguments and theories can unravel at the slightest of misunderstandings and ambiguities. So, there is always this temptation to just keep writing more: Go further, and further down the rabbit hole until you‚Äôve reached China or Wonderland, so that way no one can disagree with you or poke holes in your argument.

The more you write, however, the more you realize this is a terrible idea.

Writing a review about *Traveller* presents the same temptations and risks as any academic research might. It has a history almost as long as The Seattle Game, it has countless expansions and versions, and hundreds of fan zines and adventures ready to use. It has mechanics that range from using a sensor array, to teleporting halfway across a galaxy with immense psionic power.

Mongoose Publishing‚Äôs [*Traveller 2E (the version discussed in this review)*](https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/products/traveller-core-rulebook-update-2022) has more than 250 pages of rules and stat blocks for running and playing adventures in Charted Space (the game‚Äôs default setting). The core book is one of four books that people tend to recommend for people really interested in diving into the game. The other commonly recommended books for those new to *Traveller* are: *High Guard*, *Central Supply Catalogue,* and *Traveller‚Äôs Companion.*

Over 1,000 pages of material, items, and rules. And this is just the core + recommended books. You could talk about Mongoose‚Äôs entire *Traveller* line of products, including several dozen adventures, box sets, optional expansions, and its semi-regular volumes *Journal of the Traveller‚Äôs Aid Society*. Thousands and thousands of pages.

This is the core of the problem with talking about *Traveller* 2E: There is so much material written for the game, and the game‚Äôs scope is so ambitious that it flirts with genericism. You could never hope to capture the essence of the whole game and all of the different play experiences in a review, unless you wanted to play and test the game for years to come. And by that point anything you write will be out-of-date, and therefore not be an useful review. So, instead, here is what I will be addressing in this review:

* What is *Traveller* and what is it about?
* Is the *Traveller* Core Rulebook any good? How are the rules?
* How good are the supplements? Do I recommend any of them?
* Do I recommend *Traveller?* Who do I recommend it to?

In this review I won‚Äôt be addressing any of the following:

* A review of the complete Mongoose Publishing *Traveller* line. There are simply too review, and I don‚Äôt have that kind of cash.
* The nitty-gritty of combat rules (vehicles or people vs people). I don't have space for this, and these aren't the game's selling points anyways.

With this all said, it‚Äôs time to fire up the Jump drive and get to the review.

# What is Traveller and What is it About?

Imagine *Firefly* or *Cowboy* *Bebop*. A bunch of losers traverse the galaxy in a spaceship as they take up odd jobs in order off last month‚Äôs chicken nugget debt and a ship‚Äôs mortgage.

If you‚Äôve ever been mildly interested in trying out *Traveller*, you will probably have encountered this pitch at some point. It‚Äôs not wrong, per se, but in my opinion doesn‚Äôt really get to the core of what *Traveller* really is. Yes, **Losers in a Spaceship** is a campaign you could run in the game, but *Traveller* isn‚Äôt a game designed around being losers in a spaceship.

Jumping back to 1977, when the first of many *Traveller* versions was put out, the game was an intergalactic sandbox intended for players to make money while playing as (mostly) ex-military free traders travelling around an intergalactic sandbox governed by the rules of physics. You still had a mortgage to pay, and the game was very much in the style of the early 1970‚Äôs simulationist RPG‚Äôs that descended from wargames, such as D&D. 1977‚Äôs *Traveller* is probably the version of the game I‚Äôd most associate ‚Äúhard‚Äù sci-fi of the bunch, considering it literally requires you to use equations for travel time.

[This is not a joke, here‚Äôs a page with square roots.](https://i.imgur.com/vIFLI04.png)

Mongoose Publishing‚Äôs *Traveller* 2E is in the same vein, in many respects. It is a simulationist intergalactic sandbox. It has a rule and a stat block for everything. Many aspects of gameplay are coded and categorized in order to get immensely granular with system interactions and player budgeting.

Still there‚Äôs many tools for adventure and exploring. In fact, it‚Äôs pretty hard to get rich without adventuring, exploring, and making connections. *Traveller* is a game about living in a lived-in world, and the randomness it throws about you. *Traveller* is a game that wants to tell every story in its universe, from a crew of idiots in a Free Trader, to high in the Imperial ranks aboard a heavy battlecruiser, and it wants every role and every decision to matter.

To put it shorter: Mongoose‚Äôs *Traveller* 2E is a 1970‚Äôs simulationist game about traversing a simulated inter-connected cosmos that has been re-imagined and released for the design priorities of the mid 2010‚Äôs. It is much more gamified (gone are the orbital mechanics) while still capturing the procedural and granular ambitions of its 1970‚Äôs forebearer. And much like many sandbox games, you don‚Äôt have to use every rule (or so the community claims.) This statement is mostly correct, but I‚Äôll be returning to it a little bit later.

# Core Rules and Rulebook

# Rolling Dice and Solving Problems

*Traveller* 2E is a skill-based game that mostly requires rolls of 2D6 + Attribute Modifier + Skill Modifier + Other Modifier(s). This should be familiar to most people who play roleplaying games. However, the core rulebook is also fairly prescriptive of when a certain Attribute modifier should apply to a skill check, and sometimes it isn‚Äôt that straightforward. For example, a **Broker** check in order to buy and sell freight goods on a planet actually doesn‚Äôt involve an attribute as a bonus, but rather a different series of specific bonuses based off the planet‚Äôs attributes.

# Effect and Tasks Chains

A roll might also have an **Effect** modifier applied to it. What is **Effect?** Basically, if you exceed or fail the difficulty of a check you generate **Effect** (up to +3 or down to -3) equal to the difference between success or failure. This mostly comes up in **Task Chains**, which are linked skill checks. Here‚Äôs an example of how a task chain ended up in my game:

The crew of the *E. Honda Odyssesy*, Calliope, Lyra, Nyx, and Odysseus have strange cargo aboard that seems to be messing with their ship in jump space. They theorize that, by playing certain frequencies of sound, they can induce whatever is in their cargo to pull them out of jump space and back into normal space.

This starts with a **Science**- **Physics (EDU)** roll from Persephone (target difficulty 8). She rolls a 9, generating an **Effect** of +1.

Odysseus, who has plugged in his bass and amp into the ship‚Äôs sensors, rolls an **Art ‚Äì Instrument (Bass)** **(EDU)** check, rolling a 5 (target difficulty 8). He adds the +1 **Effect** modifier that Persephone generated, bringing his total up to 6. This is still not enough to hit the difficulty, so his roll generates an **Effect** modifier of -2.

Calliope‚Äôs **Art ‚Äì Instrument (Keyboards) (EDU)** roll is much more fortunate, as she rolls a 15 before the -2 **Effect** modifier comes into play, taking her total up to 12. She generates an **Effect** modifier of +3.

Finally at the end of the **Task Chain**, Nyx rolls a **J-Drive (Int)** check, rolling a 7 (target difficulty 12). With her natural + 2 to **J-Drive,** and the **Effect** modifier of +3, Nyx barely succeeds, and the crew causes an intentional ‚ÄúMisjump‚Äù to thrust themselves out of Jump space.

**Effect** is also useful outside of task chains, since it can be used to represent degree of success. In my game I oftentimes used **Effect** as a **Hold** (from PBTA games) on research checks, and the active player could use to ask me questions that I had to answer as truthfully as possible (with the caveat that I would not answer anything beyond the scope of the check).

Overall **Effect** and **Task Chains** combined with *Traveller‚Äôs* mostly-2d6 resolution system present a fun and engaging core system that is fun while not being over-complicated. Although sometimes I felt like the game got bogged down by some of the required **Task Chains** for things like trading goods (which was also a weird hybrid of 2d6 and 3d6) and preparing a ship to **Jump**. However, the granularity of these checks definitely have a purpose and a place in the game that I will be addressing later.

# Thoughts on Character Creation

If *Traveller* has one killer feature, it‚Äôs character creation. You may have heard the rumor that you can die in *Traveller*‚Äôs character creation. Although to my knowledge this is not true of the version I played (unless you incorporate an expansion), but it was true of the original 1977 *Traveller*. However, PC death is not the reason to try character creation out. No, you will want to try it out because it is absolutely some of the most fun you will ever have.

This is most fun as a group of friends in Session 0. Have everyone listen and talk to each other while each person takes up the spotlight to roll their own special little buddy up.

# The Process of Creation

Character creation in *Traveller* involves a heavily randomized lifepath system, which launches your PC like a chicken from a cannon through a series of career terms (that you can end at almost any time). While you and your PC may have hopes and dreams for their future, you will quickly find them crushed under the weight of Imperialism and Capitalism.

Take, for example, one poor PC from my game: Ms. Calliope C‚Äôthanifix, a Vargr who dreamed of delivering mail for the Scouts and the Imperial mail service. Unfortunately, she rolled up with an **Education (EDU) of 2**, which made qualifying for (and maintaining) any career incredibly difficult. Yet, somehow, she qualified for the **Scout** lifepath. However, when things went well, she suddenly found herself thrown out because her stats were too low to maintain her career. She ended up as a **Drifter**, until eventually she fell into a career as a **Merchant Marine**. With her random assortment of skills, and some dumb luck, she found herself coming out really well. By the time she mustered out at the age of 36, she had a nice career, a healthy paycheck, useful skills, and even a share of a **Free Trader** (the game‚Äôs ‚Äúmascot‚Äù spaceship).

This sounds all nice and interesting, but simply relaying this story does not convey how much of an emotional rollercoaster this was. There was one point where things went so poorly for the character that I laughed so hard I cried.

**I‚Äôm a GM. I never have fun in character creation!**

And then, when Calliope started to have real success as a **Merchant Marine**, we were all on the edge of out seats. We even egged her on to do one more term so that she might finally make that promotion. Also, for some context, keep in mind that every single term Calliope spent as a **Merchant Marine** came with significant risk of getting kicked out due to her poor stats.

And in that final term, when Calliope finally rolled her promotion, **we cheered, and everyone clapped**. Moments like this don‚Äôt happen anywhere else in roleplaying that I‚Äôm aware of.

The rules of character creation are great. If I could roll up every character like this, I would.

# A Label for Everything

One thing that Mongoose (and all versions of *Traveller*) did inherit from the 1977 version is the UWP Code. This annoying 8-digit little code is assigned to every single planet in *Traveller*. Each digit reflects a fact about the world that it is assigned to. For example, one of the world‚Äôs in my game, Luanina, is run by a dictator named Jane Hernandez. Jane syndicates a nightly soap opera that also serves as a vehicle to inform the public about new laws and policies. Luanina‚Äôs UWP code is: D6537BB-6. This means a lot of things, but what is most important to understand is that this provides a general description of the planet. However, just like in real life, players might find that labels are just that: labels. Never judge a book by its cover.

UWP codes are sort of the bane of my existence but are necessary for *Traveller‚Äôs* crunchy trade system. I personally find them difficult to read, and I actually wrote an entire blog post on how I would redesign them for my own purposes.

UWP codes reflect *Traveller‚Äôs* tendency to provide rules, rulings, and labels such that the entire experience is codified. And, at least with the Mongoose edition I ran, I am fairly certain that this is intentional design. As I said earlier, the game is ambitious to the point that it flirts with generecism. But, intentionally designed to do what, exactly?

# Rules and Complexity

Don‚Äôt let my descriptions of the game‚Äôs rules and my experience mislead you, *Traveller* is a complicated game. While many games with the label ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù or ‚Äúcrunchy‚Äù might focus their crunchiness on the abilities and powers of the PC‚Äôs, *Traveller*‚Äôs complexity is an emergent property of its interconnected game systems. Similar to *D&D*, this game is about resource management, and much of its drama comes from conflicted generated by the demands placed on the PC‚Äôs resources. However, *Traveller* differs from a dungeon crawler in that the core resource that is consistently tested and pushed is the player‚Äôs finances.

There‚Äôs a reason that the most common trope in the game is about a rag-tag crew trying to pay off their ship‚Äôs mortgage: *Traveller* is a game holistically designed to generate dramatic tension through incremental taxation on the players economic resources.

This is why every single time players want to go into **Jump** (Method FTL travel) the players are required to do a linked task. This is why combat is fairly deadly without expensive equipment. This is why Brokering and trading for goods while **Jumping** between worlds is a multi-step process. This is why 2 points of damage to a ship‚Äôs **Hull** costs 200,000 **Credits** to fix. This is why any **Jump** takes a week. This is why UWP code‚Äôs exist.

The game is a slow-burn resource management game that encourages the players to take on extra work in order to defeat the math that is going to, inevitably, weigh them down with the Invisible Hand of the Free Market.

And while this core experience might not sound fun if you look at it through a purely analytical POV, it does really start to shape into something interesting and compelling, if you are the type of group that values the drama that granular randomness provides.

This approach, however, is not without its demerits.

# Why I Loath this Gorram Rulebook

For some additional context, there are two versions of the Mongoose *Traveller* 2E rulebook. There is the 2016 original 2E core book which has this cover, and there is the 2022 updated Core Rulebook. I ran the game out of the 2022 updated Core Rulebook. There were apparently some changes between the two versions (but not enough to call it an edition change). The most notable change was the move from [isometric starship](https://i.imgur.com/mqxsWs4.png) maps to [top-down maps.](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj44vmQWFsVm7KscPMobDFEvKZjoDLD1_IpEnYxCU84jrVR7XrmPujbaccLPG-ec8oP2yrmoaRoWjhiP651h75YiGAkXNUYgK9Nmqm3YAHSGlxvZ78KymTyxKdBJw5tiFzvAPKvgju1EJIbhbEXHoX01JLPGlOv7GAqiNS5yucYQaxag9c_i7LVEpDQ/s1350/freetrader.jpg)

While there are good reasons to change from isometric maps to top-down (GM‚Äôs will want to run personal combat on their starship at some point and top-down maps are good for that), I actually prefer the isometric maps as a means to help me and the players grok the starship‚Äôs layout. Whelp, you win some, you lose some. Anyways, back to the topic on hand.

The more complex and granular your rules, and the closer your game swings towards simulationist generecism; the more difficult it becomes to write a rulebook that accounts for all settings, all scenarios, and all styles of play. If you consider that all of this content needs to fit in a certain page count for physical production, this problem becomes even more complicated.

Writing a rulebook ain‚Äôt easy. But still, few rulebooks\* (\*for games published by mainstream RPG publishers) have ever made me as frustrated as *Traveller* when adjudicating and learning the rules. The location of common rules was often unintuitive (and not listed in the Index) and took up significant time during play. Reading through the book just felt like I was reading someone‚Äôs sticky notes left on their computer monitor: One moment, you‚Äôre reading about the rules for low gravity, and then fatigue, and then you‚Äôre reading about the rules for Medical Treatment and Surgery. Then, BAM, another sticky note reminding you that Humans and Animals have completely different rules for health and how random encounters work. ¬†

As an aside: I think that rule (animal vs human health) is stupid. They should all just use health. The only reason human health is calculated in the same way as players is to reinforce a sense of realism. I dislike doing it this way because it doesn‚Äôt really tie into the core **Money-as-resource** gameplay loop, and instead just adds pointless admin from the GM to track.

Rules were often spread throughout the rulebook unintuitively, but none were egregious as the placement of the introductions to **Tech Level** and **Starport Quality**. This will require a brief explanation of the information that exists in UWP codes:

UWP Codes provide the following information, in order, with each digit of the code representing information about the planet that can be found on a corresponding chart:

\[Starport Quality\] \[Planet Size\] \[Planet Atmosphere\] \[Planet Hydrographic Index\] \[Population Level\] \[Government Type\] \[Law Level\]-\[Tech Level\]

So, naturally, **Tech Level** I (the last item in the UWP code) is only introduced and explained on page 6, and **Starport Quality** is introduced on explained on page 257 after the explanations of Planet Size, Hydrographic Index, Population level, Government Type, and Law Level.

While this might seem nitpicky, UWP codes are one of the most important features of the **Money-as-resource** gameplay loop *Traveller‚Äôs* granular rules are designed around. Every planet has a UWP code. Players plan complicated trading routes based on the information UWP codes provide. DM‚Äôs make informed setting decisions based on UWP codes.

Why aren‚Äôt UWP codes explained earlier, instead of in a sidebar on page 248 when they are so vital to the intended gameplay loop? Why is the information that each digit in a UWP code presented in such an unintuitive order, rather than following the order of the code?

*Traveller* veterans probably won‚Äôt see the problem here, but for my group that was learning the game as we played, the work and rulebook-flipping required to understand UWP codes was frustrating and took up valuable time. Even after we learned the basics, the granularity of the charts in each section required us all to flip through the book to find the information we needed, since we could not reasonably expect to memorize every chart.

It felt like every process and every rule necessitated constant flipping, and the poor organization really slowed us down considerably, and our game was lesser for it.

This wasn‚Äôt a group of an RPG-newbie problem or a table either. I have run 12+ different games of varying complexity. One of my players is a professional boardgame and TTRPG designer. The rest of my group are veterans who have played dozens of games between each other. My group has played several games together at this point, and we know how to work efficiently to figure out rules and rules interactions.

The rulebook‚Äôs organizational decisions just served to slow us down, much in the way I complained about regarding [*Star Trek Adventures first edition.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1bizbk5/a_brief_review_of_the_modiphius_star_trek_rpg/)

Do I know how to fix this problem? Slightly. Is it fixable? Definitely. Was it expected due to the game‚Äôs complexity? Yes. It‚Äôs still very frustrating.

# Spaceballs, the RPG Supplements

Mongoose Publishing has, I think, published more than a hundred different supplements and products related to *Traveller* 2E. ¬†Most of these are sourcebooks or adventures. And because I‚Äôm not a Youtuebe reviewer I don‚Äôt get a massive influx of products for free, so reviewing everything Mongoose releases is out of the question. I paid for everything *Traveller*-related I have with cold, hard, cash.

I own the following *Traveller* products. If there‚Äôs a smiley-face next to it, it means I recommend it to people who are interested in checking out *Traveller*, and that it is worth your money. A frowny-face means I did not like the product, and don‚Äôt recommend it.

Generally speaking, I don‚Äôt like a lot of the *Traveller* products I‚Äôve encountered so far. Many of them, especially those from earlier in *Traveller* 2E‚Äôs life, suffer from misguided organization (I could write an entire novel about this, I won‚Äôt), and frankly are not the most useful or interesting. I found the art in most of those uninspiring, and the focus on *Traveller‚Äôs* granular rules a little bit frustrating. ¬†All of the wrong details, in all of the wrong places in half-baked products.


*Author‚Äôs Hot Take:* *If an adventure opens with a UWP, then that adventure is prioritizing the wrong things.*

As far as the adventures go, Mongoose‚Äôs *Traveller* adventures are really hit-or-miss. I really, really hated *The Last Train out of Rakken-Goll*, but the product itself is reflective of my larger issues with the standalone adventures: they often provide the wrong types of information and guidance to a GM that wants to run the game. For example, I felt *Mission to Mithril* lacked a compelling structure that aided the DM (it‚Äôs a bizarrely under-monstered and railroady hexcrawl), nor the level of art I‚Äôd want in order to justify its $20 price tag. However, *Mysteries on Arcturus* *Station* was absolutely superb, and was everything I had ever wanted in an adventure (bonus points for extreme replay-ability).

I disliked *Islands in the Rift* because, similar to *Rakken-Goll* and *Mithril* I felt like it didn‚Äôt provide enough content or guidance to really justify its price tag. Seth Skorkowsky loved *Islands in the Rift*, but I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs influenced by his experience running an absolutely epic campaign based off of it. However, for me, it just didn‚Äôt have everything I would want from an at the price it‚Äôs sold at. I‚Äôd rather pick of [*Winter‚Äôs Daughter*](https://necroticgnome.com/products/dolmenwood-winters-daughter), [*Lurkers*](https://modiphius.net/en-us/products/star-trek-adventures-mission-pdf-023-lurkers)*,* or [*Shadowdark Zines*](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/collections/cursed-scroll-zine) simply because I know that there is going to be a minimum level of quality and usefulness that I know these products will meet.

As for the catalogue-style books (*Highguard, Central Supply, etc.*) I would really only recommend those to the types of DM‚Äôs who love running Generic RPGs such as GURPS. They are page after page of items, and item stats. These never really came in handy for my game, and I personally regret my purchase of them. I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy flipping with item sourcebooks, so I didn‚Äôt really get any personal enjoyment out of these either. I am a little surprised that these are recommended so often for newbies over *Journal of the Traveller‚Äôs Aid Society* (JTAS). These books are a serious financial investment for a product that really only serves a certain style of play.

Catalogues and adventures addressed: where *Traveller* products really do seem to excel are what I call mixed-content books like *Aliens of Charted Space* and the various Volumes of the *Journal of the Traveller‚Äôs Aid Society* (JTAS). The sheer volume of content in these basically assures you will find something interesting and usable in your game. *Traveller* content is at its best when it is providing something novel for your game that helps to convey the game‚Äôs Charted Space setting. *Aliens of Charted Space* was a joy to read (especially to learn about my guys, the Bwap). The volumes of *JTAS* and *Aliens of Charted Space* both provided me with some very cool ships, a useful decent-quality adventure (or two), and some fun setting details. As far as I am concerned *JTAS* volumes are probably the best bang for buck.

Although I cannot afford to read all of them, t is very likely that all of the Volumes in these two series are worth your money. If they look interesting enough to, and I actually recommend to newbie GM‚Äôs that they pick up the two volumes of these that I have in my collection, instead of *High Guard* and the other catalogue books that are usually recommended. These books will serve as a sampler for you to use as you develop a better sense of the types of resources that are useful for you and your playgroup, rather than shelling out $120+ on the typical recommended sourcebooks.

Lastly, the *Referee‚Äôs* *Screen* is excellent, and I can only imagine that the newest version is just as good.

Despite liking *Aliens* *of Charted Space* and *JTAS* (and the consistent improvements to adventures and sourcebooks over the lifecycle of *Traveller* 2E), I still find myself to be a very hesitant buyer of *Traveller* supplements. I‚Äôve been burned by one-too-many *The Last Train out of Rakken-Golls* to really endorse the game‚Äôs product line, despite the occasional temptation. For example[, *Last call at Eneri‚Äôs Cantina*](https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/products/core-adventure-2-last-call-at-eneris-cantina?_pos=1&_sid=9567327be&_ss=r) looks compelling, and the preview art and layout **looks** like an improvement. But is it actually a good adventure? I don‚Äôt know. And I don‚Äôt have the confidence to buy the adventure to find out. And because there‚Äôs not really a robust review community for *Traveller* products in the same way there is for *D&D*, it‚Äôs pretty easy to get burnt on a bad product purchase. In short: I really don‚Äôt like the Russian roulette I have to play when it comes to Mongoose‚Äôs products.

Mongoose, if you are reading, I would actually really love to write an in-depth review of [*Bounty Hunter*](https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/products/bounty-hunter). It looks exactly like the type of product I would value for my *Traveller* game, and the preview pages look promising. As it stands, I just can‚Äôt make a purchase with any confidence.

In short: be careful about purchasing supplements for *Traveller* as a newbie. The various volumes of *JTAS* and *Aliens of Charted Space* are probably your safest purchases if you are looking to get your feet wet with more material without breaking the bank or running into disappointment.

# Do I Like Traveller? Do I Recommend It?

My players and I have enjoyed our time with *Traveller*, despite some of our mutual frustrations with the game. Although, I doubt my current group will be returning to it any time soon. This is partially because we are pretty donezo with the core rulebook, and because ultimately it doesn‚Äôt actually fit the constraints and style of playgroup. My *Traveller* group meets for 3-4 hours, once every two weeks, online, on a weekday, which was to our detriment when it comes to this game. We‚Äôre very roleplay heavy, so this means we have a lot of time between rolls and interacting with the core mechancis.

*Traveller* is the type of game where you want the players to engage with all of the mechanics and processes in order to ramp up the tension between time and monetary resources. Unfortunately, the processes (especially trading) take time. You can automate these things with a spreadsheet (like we did), but at the end of the day the admin work we were doing was really running into the story and the characters in an unpleasant way. This led us to have an unbalanced experience: sometimes a session might be dominated by trade rolls and admin, and the other times it might be dominated by another process or procedure.

However, I don‚Äôt think this is going to be an issue for groups who meet in-person and for longer sessions. Crosstalk, which really only happens in-person, seems like it would address the group-boredom that seemed to occur when my ship‚Äôs **Broker** was dealing with trade rolls. And the longer session times should lead to a more balanced experience with the game.

If my sessions were 5-6 hours long, I probably would not have been frustrated by the uneven and inconsistent gaming experience my sessions seemed to produce. I probably would have been able to explore all of the mechanics with the depth they deserve. However, my constraints are my constraints, and I learned a lot from this experience.

Do I like *Traveller?* Yes. I will probably run it again.

Do I recommend *Traveller*? This is a harder question to answer, I definitely cannot recommend it to everyone. Instead, I want to provide advice on those whose interest is already piqued (or has been piqued by this review):

If you are interested in *Traveller*, buy the core rulebook and *JTAS Vol.1*. Run some adventures that take place in the same system as the planet Hazel (from the adventure *Ship in the Lake* in JTAS Vo.1). ¬†Make sure you give yourself at least 4 hours per session, although 5+ will be better. Try to run it in-person. Make sure everyone at your table is willing to learn the rules to help you run the game.

Run 8-10 sessions.

You‚Äôll know.

**But what if I don‚Äôt want to run eight sessions?**

The people I can recommend *Traveller* for, then, are those people who really enjoy the granularity and modularity of something like *Gurps*, *Cyberpunk: Red*, or various crunchy Generic or borderline-Generic games. I can also recommend it to people who love accumulating things. Traveller has tons of *stuff*. In many ways the game is about *stuff.* If you like games with lots of catalogues of weapons and items, then *Traveller* might be worth a shot.

However, if you‚Äôre looking to tell a space opera, or something like *Cowboy Bebop*, and you run shorter sessions, then I think there are games out there that will better suit your needs.

Want to run *D&D* but in space? Look at [*Starfinder*](https://paizo.com/starfinder) first. Hint: you might want to wait till *Starfinder 2* releases.

Want to run something episodic problem-of-the-week? Look, here‚Äôs [*Star Trek Adventures.*](https://modiphius.net/en-us/collections/star-trek-adventures/products/star-trek-adventures-the-roleplaying-game-second-edition-core-rulebook)

Want to run *Cowboy Bebop* or *Star Wars*? Look at [*Scum and Villainy*](https://evilhat.com/product/scum-and-villainy/) or [*Edge of the Empire*](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-edge-of-the-empire/) first.

However, if you want to run a sci-fi game with a storied history, and the ambition to match the sheer depth of its setting and granularity, and don‚Äôt mind a few paint marks? Try *Traveller*.

Want to tell the story of a small group of space idiots just trying to make it in a world that is too big to care about them? That sounds like *Traveller* to me.

In my opinion, the game is best when it is about stories so small that you could sink into its infinite setting forever and be happy. *Traveller* is a game and a setting that rewards lifetime players. I‚Äôve seen where this game can go, and the beautiful moments it can produce.

Ultimately, between the frustrating, it's insane scope, the time-consuming process-driven core gameplay loop, hit-or-miss publisher support,  and its hyper-expansive setting, it‚Äôs just too much for me. But there are definitely people out there it is for.

This is something I've been thinking about recently. I'm wondering about how some GMs use game systems that really don't suit their play or game style, but religiously stick to that one system.

**My question is, who else out there knows GMs stuck on the one system, what is it, why do you think it's wrong for them and what do you think they should try next?**

1ej2chg,Grumble/Gripe: No more Firefly/Serenity RPG support.,"Old news for most, I guess.¬† Margaret Weis Productions stopped its efforts to develop its Firefly TTRPG back around 2015.¬† No detailed explanation given.

I found out only because I ""inherited"" all the books from someone who had decided to focus on the D&D franchise instead.¬† A cursory search turned up no new material (other than fan-made items).¬† I'll do a more intensive search next week.

It seems that popular TV/Movie franchises inspired some decent TTRPG products -- Stargate (Alderac & Wyvern), Star Trek (FASA), and Star Wars (WEG), to name a few -- that have suddenly stopped production.¬† There is still Traveller, but that's not based on any one franchise.

I have always been more interested in Science-Fiction than Fantasy.¬† TV and motion pictures have filled that need for a few decades.¬† TTRPGs also contributed.¬† Now, all that seems to be left are a few ""orphaned"" products and a lot of B-Grade fanworks.

Bummer.

**\[edit=18\_hours\_later\]**

Lessons Learned

1. RPGs based on specific media franchises are inherently short-lived.  Licenses can be pulled at any time, or simply not renewed.
2. For a creative mind, only the core books of any game are needed.
3. RPGs offering generic rules systems as their primary selling points are a more commercially viable choice, as even the most obscure media franchise can be squeezed into them.
4. No matter how clearly a situation is explained, there will always be someone who misunderstands its content, context, or intent.

I read an AP of the game on another forum and thought that it looked interesting, so I got the book (and the core World of Darkness book once I found out I needed that; this was the first edition) and I was hooked pretty much right away.

However, I‚Äôm sure most of you can agree that D&D 5e is a very flawed system, and I‚Äôve definitely noticed many issues throughout my play. Primarily, I dislike the lack of non-combat and RP abilities given to players and how much of the available content (for players and GMs) feels very uninspired/generic.

Thanks!

UPDATE RESPONSE:  


Thank you everyone for the recommendations! I've just finished reviewing every one of your suggestions and am still weighing my options. The theme that I offered to the rabbis as a driving narrative purpose behind the game is ""empathy of the other"". For that reason, I'm leaning towards Thorny Game's¬†*Sign*.

* **Pathfinder** \- Ultra crunchy combat-focused fantasy with lots of tables & rules for tactics

There was a sexual assault scene on the Far Verona stream a while ago, but I only saw it last night. Nobody was cool with it.

Whenever the subject of sensitivity and compassion relating to the comfort and safety of your friends in your gaming group comes up, there's a swell against it as SJW-bullshit, PC-coddling, or outright censorship.

I don't think that's a helpful take.

Last week I saw announced here a new Kickstarter coming up. I have never backed anything there, so I just went to take a peek.This project had a great concept and great art, so I decied to back it.  


The next couple of days they hosted an AMA on discord, I was weirded out that it wasn't on twitter or reddit as other AMAs I've seen.I joined the call and the actual developers were there! This may seem normal (or not) to you, but please bare with me, as an only DnD player it seemed pretty surreal.They seemed as such passionate and down to earth guys.They told some of the guys in the call to play a game at friday. At that time I wasn't sure if it was an empty promise or not, but I surprised. They were playing with people at the server.I asked if I could join the call and watched the end of the session, then I spent like 2 hours talking with the developers.  


Why I was giving all my money to a big developer like WoTC? They clearly dont give a sh\*t about us as community, even less about us as individuals.I'm not saying all of the WoTC employees are at fault, I'm sure there are some passionate guys out there, but when we support small/new creators we can assure that all of our support goes to the people who actually care, not to some Hasbro executive that is planning on how to charge us for everytime we throw a die.  
(Sorry again if I'm the only one here who realised this just now, Im a noob at TTRPGs as a whole)

1h5zmq9,Is this the best time to be an RPG fan?,"I only started somewhat recently with TTRPGs, have been playing 5e for a couple of years as a player in a fantastic group. Then started GMing for one shots and since this year I'm running a campaign with a newbie group and additional one shots.

Naturally I got into reading, watching stuff. The OSR is fascinating, new books and developments all over the place. There are a ton of interesting articles all over the web.

I treated myself with some amazing books:

- The 5e2024 (player + dmg) edition, which is an excellent evolution from 2014.
- Shadowdark (plus some small adventures), which is great for one shots and open tables as it's full of simple, flavorful and well designed sub-systems, and interesting tables.
- Dolmenwood, which I only just started reading, but it's an absolutely gorgeous, deep setting and is pretty much perfect for the group I run a campaign for.

And those are ""just"" some relatively recent DnD adjacent books... There are other interesting systems, countless adventures that all fascinate me.

As of now my hobby budget is overdrawn and I don't even have the capacity/time to use even more stuff for actual play. But even _just reading_ these books is fulfilling on its own.

Youtube and the web in general is _full_ of great content. There are so many niches, styles and approaches to playing RPGs that all sort of build a interconnected universe of awesome.

I've also recently bought Outcast Silver Raiders, which is a low fantasy satanic scottish vagabond simulator that has it's own system, setting and a whole book that describes literally every location on the map. There's a ton of random encounters, faction play, a lot of quests etc.

I think I love this kind of product, it feels very complete and makes me very excited to run it. I think it's because I, as the GM, also kind of discover and explore the world along with the players, since I deliberately read the location descriptions only if the players decide to go there. I'm also recently trying to cut down on prep time (it was starting to get ridiculous), so these ""ready made sandboxes"" are perfect for me.

lzs60b,Is it valid to enjoy RPG without much role-playing?,"When I was much younger than I am now, I used to really enjoy RPGs. Things I remember liking about them include:

* beating the challenges presented by combat encounters;
* creative problem-solving and investigative work in non-combat situations;
* sense of progression as my character levels up and becomes more powerful;
* (as a secondary consideration) witnessing the story-telling and the world-building done by the GM, and possibly doing some of that myself at my own pace.

At the same time, I specifically did not (and do not now) enjoy role-playing and (for lack of a better term) being charismatic. I prefer to have conversations out-of-character, at least at my end (e.g. I'd prefer to say ""I greet the NPC"" as opposed to saying ""I turn to NPC and say *'Hello!'*""; I don't have a strong preference as to whether GM replies ""The NPC greets you back"" or ""The NPC says *'Hello, traveller!'*"".). I like the fact that I can in principle have an elaborate back-story, but it's important to me that I'm allowed to keep it to a bare minimum (""I was orphaned when I was a child, a wizard took me in as his apprentice, now I'm ready to go adventuring.""). I get mildly uncomfortable when GM asks me to describe in detail what my outfit looks like or how I strike the finishing blow in a combat situation, especially when this has no effect on the mechanics of the game.

I've recently been trying to get back into RPGs, and in several unrelated instances in a row I encountered people who emphasise the role-playing/charismatic aspects of the game over the parts that I personally enjoy, and haven't yet had much luck with finding like-minded people. Since my experience with RPGs is limited and mostly set far in the past, this makes me question: *Is my approach to RPGs even valid?* Is it reasonable for me to hope to find a group whose play-style better fits my preferences, or should I just accept that RPGs are fundamentally different than what I enjoy? Are my preferences a matter of a legitimate difference in tastes, or am I simply being unsophisticated and/or misguided?

(In some basic sense, I'm aware that my preferences are obviously valid, in the sense that anything is valid if everyone involved is having fun. An analogy that comes to mind: There is nothing wrong with liking fast-food more than French cuisine, just like there is nothing wrong with liking Indian cuisine more than French cuisine. However, if I expressed these two preferences, I would expect rather different responses. I'm basically asking whether in this analogy I'm a fast-food enthusiast or an Indian food enthusiast.)

Any insight would be very much appreciated!

Also, just to pre-empt the obvious comment: Yes, I am quite aware that ""RP"" in RPG stands for ""role-playing"" ;)

EDIT TO ADD: I'd like to clarify one point in which I might have not expressed myself clearly. While I do enjoy combat, I also very much enjoy non-combat related activities. I'm not specifically looking to hack and slash. Conducting an investigation or solving a riddle or resolving a conflict are also definitely things I like. I'm just more excited about figuring the solution from 3rd person perspective than in role-playing the interactions that are involved in it.

But they can, with the right toolset, be played solo too. Some are even designed to be played solo from the ground up.

Is it the same? No. Does it provide the banter, and  camaraderie, and collaboration? Not at all.

Either way, it can give you, as a player, one of the things that make RPGs so thrilling; participation in an unpredictable emergent storytelling experience.

I am glad you like PbtA. I am. I love this community and I think it's great that PbtA has such enthusiastic fans. But I swear to Crom, it is a TERRIBLE idea to recommend a PbtA (or PbtA adjacent) game to someone just barely peeking their head out of the Cave of 5th Edition.

It's like if someone in Cleveland said, ""hey, I'm tired of the place I usually eat, do you know any other good restaurants?"" and you recommended something in PARIS. Yes, I'm sure it's very good, BUT IT'S TOO FAR FROM WHERE THEY ARE NOW TO BE A USEFUL SUGGESTION.

RuneQuest. Shadow of the Demon Lord/Weird Wizard. DCC. Pathfinder. There are plenty of games that are still crunchy high fantasy with fun combat systems that AREN'T 5th edition, things that will broaden a 5E player's horizons without making them bluescreen. I know a bunch of you are Apocalypse-pilled, but one of the things PbtA fans seem to love about it is that it is SO VERY DIFFERENT from ""traditional"" rpgs (which 5E clearly is). Maybe - JUST MAYBE - giving someone who only knows 5E a game that requires them to COMPLETELY REBUILD THEIR CONCEPTION OF HOW RPGs WORK is... I dunno, *a little much*.

With all the love in the world, I ask you to be gentle with them. They're trying. Steppin' out of their comfort zone. Please don't throw 'em into the deep end right off.

EDITED TO ADD:

For everyone who said that what's *really* important is to find out *why* someone wants to try stuff outside 5e and *what* they are looking for before deciding whether to suggest a PbtA game, I have two responses to make:

1. This is an *excellent* point, the kind of thing that really moves the conversation forward constructively, and I agree 101%.
2. In my entire time in this subreddit, I have never once seen a PbtA fan actually ask what someone is looking for in a game-rec before jumping in to suggest a PbtA game.

1. The company is very active on social media. Employees of the company appear on podcasts and YouTube channels all the time.
2. The company releases a free DLC PDF every month with new rules, new cyberware, new weapons, new NPCs. I think this is a huge win for keeping people engaged in the game. I look forward to that free DLC every month. And for the people like me that want that physical product, they roll a bunch of DLCs into a softcover book with one new article and sell it as a PDF or a POD book.
3. They released a set of pins through Pinny Arcade. The pins came with 4 new pieces of cyberware on a card. When they found out the pins were not available outside the US, they released a PDF of just the cyberware for $0.99.
4. They sold out of their GM screen. They're still looking for a printer to make new screens. It's been a WHILE since the screens were available. So, they discounted the GM PDF screen to $1.00 until the physical screens are back in stock as a ""Sorry this is taking so long"" gift.
5. They run a Discord server and the people that wrote the game are on it all the time answering questions. Heck, one of the game designers recently did a chat Q&A because his plane got delayed at the airport and he had some time to kill.
6. They go to Pax Unplugged and Gen-Con.

Conventionally, when you write rules for an RPG, you put them into a PDF. With my most recent project, instead of designing the rules to be put in a PDF, I focused on building a wiki.

The advantage of a wiki is that it is very easy to navigate, and if hosted on a website, very easy to share. I used [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) to [make my most recent game](https://ttadventuretime.github.io), which has additional virtues:

1. It uses an index-card system, where you can have multiple pages (""cards"") open at once, and link someone to all of the cards you had open. You can also bookmark and un-bookmark cards. You can have cards composed of other cards, so you can link people to just one particular rule you want to refer to. It just has all sorts of excellent navigation features.
2. You can download the whole wiki as an HTML page for offline viewing, and it isn't a large file.
3. It looks great. I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but honestly think it is easier to design a good looking wiki with this than a good looking PDF.
4. It was very easy to make. I have like 0 programming experience and I didn't have difficulty with it.

I like beautiful TTRPG books and own a tonne - they are fun and part off a long tradition in the hobby.

* Your opponent stat blocks are in sprawling paragraph form in size 8 font? **Pass**.
* Your opponent stat blocks require me to cross reference to a huge library of powers, edges, or spells for rules text? **Pass**.

If you give me a choice between a monster book with 100 monsters in tight paragraph form with spell lists, or 75 monsters laid out nicely with critical stats highlighted and all ability text written out right in the stat block, I will take the latter every time.

Adding a monster/opponent to my session should be as simple as cracking the book and shouting, ""Roll for initiative!"" For all the complaints I had about D&D 4e, the one thing that edition did flawlessly was provide opponent information exactly as you'd want to see it in play, at the table.

Your opponent formatting isn't an afterthought. A stressed GM shouldn't have to retain the text of half a dozen spells or edges in-mind while trying to run an entertaining combat. They shouldn't have to spread sticky tabs through the manual to run all the rules widgets for one monster.

It boggles my mind that even some of today's most popular RPGs don't prioritize this.

1ddj7lw,Some odd advice in the FFXIV RPG - how do Japanese tables handle losing in combat?,"While I wait for my copy of the Starter Set for the Final Fantasy 14 RPG to ship to me, I've been reading through the sample PDFs that Square Enix put out on their website. Most of it is totally standard and normal, but there's a bit that stuck out like a sore thumb to me.

There's a section of the GM's Guide pamphlet that talks about what to do if the party loses in combat, and it has this to say:

> **Handling Party Defeat**
>
>An adventurer‚Äôs life is full of danger. One unlucky turn too many, and they can easily find themself Knocked Out. If all party members are reduced to 0 HP, the party is defeated. Some scenarios include directions for dealing with this situation, but if yours does not, talk with the other players and decide how your group wants to handle it.
>
> Typically, you‚Äôll want to choose from among the following
options, but your group is welcome to come up with exciting
or amusing alternatives instead.
>
> **1. Retry the Encounter**
>Retrying from the beginning of an encounter will let players anticipate the actions their enemies may take, resulting in a better chance of victory. When a party wipes during a boss battle or similarly challenging encounter, you can also lower the difficulty by restoring the adventurers‚Äô HP and MP and allowing them to
retry from the beginning of the phase. Retrying an encounter can be time-consuming. If you‚Äôre nearing the end of your session, it may be best to quicksave and try again the next time you play.
>
> **2. Restart the Scenario**
> Scenarios are often shaped by the adventurers‚Äô actions, and encounters and endings may change depending on the choices that they make. As such, your group can choose to take a party wipe as an opportunity to begin the scenario
anew. It goes without saying that this will take even longer than retrying a single encounter, so you may want to wait until your next session before starting over. When starting a new scenario, players can either prepare new adventurer sheets of the appropriate level, or level up their existing adventurers to match the scenario‚Äôs level.
>
> If a player chooses to continue playing as the same adventurer, have them write down the name of any scenarios they‚Äôve completed in their profile so they can keep track of their character‚Äôs exploits and experiences.
>
> **3. Improvise**
Improvising solutions on the fly might seem like a daunting task, but you can always plan for situations like this in advance. For example, here‚Äôs a good trick to keep up your sleeve:
>
>>GM: Just when things are looking grim for the party, help arrives in the nick of time and revives the fallen adventurers! 
>
> Look at that! An ally swoops in to save the day, and the adventurers recover just enough to continue the fight. It‚Äôs up to you how much HP the adventurers regain, but you can always default to half of their Max HP, rounded up.
>
> When using this option, you may want to come up with narrative reasons to make it more compelling for the other players. Perhaps an NPC the party helped earlier in the story appeared to repay a previous kindness, or an enemy decided to show mercy (or contempt) and let the party live.
>
> You‚Äôll also need to think of a reason for their newfound health. White magic, Potions, or even time bought through a well-placed distraction could explain how the adventurers survived a seemingly lethal encounter.
>
> **4. Skip the Encounter**
> If you‚Äôre running short on time, you can always choose to advance the story as if the adventurers had won the encounter.
>
> Take care not to overuse this option, as skipping encounters can defeat the purpose of the game. There‚Äôs
nothing wrong with dialogue-focused stories if players are looking to roleplay, but encounters in the Final Fantasy XIV TTRPG also make up a key part of the narrative. Leaving the outcome of player choices to chance can take the story in unexpected and exciting directions, and can even create fresh opportunities for roleplay.

All of this advice seems totally insane and borderline heretical to me. Like, can you imagine if in the new D&D edition, the Player's handbook said, *""if you have a TPK, don't worry! Just restart the fight from the beginning so that your players can metagame to victory!""* or *""if you have a TPK, don't worry! You can just, like, pretend that they didn't and keep playing as if they had won!""* People would lose their minds!

But I have to wonder if that's just because I was raised in American gaming culture. Since this is a game written by a Japanese person for a Japanese audience (it credits Yoshiyuki Fushimi as the only designer, from Hobby Japan), it occurred to me that this might be just a cultural difference and that a Japanese RPG player would find this advice completely normal and standard.

Does anyone have any insight into this? Thanks in advance.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1603a2d50>,rpg,1718125401.0

1hhq17h,"What can a grid-based tactical RPG with an emphasis on ranged combat options do to promote aggressive engagements instead of turtling, kiting, and other defensive tactics?","Recently, I have been playing and GMing a certain grid-based tactical RPG in a sci-fi setting. It has an emphasis on ranged combat options. I have noticed that, intentionally or otherwise, combatants are disinclined towards aggressive engagements and instead find a better risk:reward ratio in turtling, kiting, and other defensive tactics. (Grenades and missiles really are not that good in this game, too, in my opinion.) Maybe this is true to real life, but I find that it makes for a boring tactical experience.

I am aware that sci-fi wargames, and at least one grid-based tactical sci-fi RPG with lots of ranged combat, solve this through objective/capture points. These are usually zones on the map that units have to stay inside in order to ""capture"" them or something similar (e.g. hack the terminals). Alternatives include an object that needs to be pushed around the map by staying next to it (e.g. escort the truck), and points that need to be defended from enemy attacks (e.g. protect the towers). Often, these zones are out in the open, making them difficult to turtle in. Objective/capture points also make AoE stronger, for good or for ill.

Are there ways other than objective/capture points for a game's mechanics to encourage aggressive engagements even when there is an emphasis on ranged combat options?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x16080d790>,rpg,1734604127.0
1hspquf,What's your RPG New Year's Resolution?,"What are you hoping to accomplish or change this year? 

For me, I have four:

* **Improve scene descriptions.** I was lousy with describing locations this year, being both rushed yet long-winded. I want my descriptions to be focused, clear, and evocative. I'll prep room descriptions beforehand to get some practice.

* **Make more handouts.** I only made four handouts last year, which is a shame because my players and I love them. Since I run sci-fi, this will probably manifest as ship schematics, planetary database entries, and SpaceNet sites. I already do half the work for these, so I just need to make them nice and presentable to players.

* **Play more solo games.** I've accumulated a lot of solo games last year that I haven't played: HARDCASE, Dead Belt, Outsiders, KUROI, and others I'm forgetting. And new solo games come out all the time. I'll commit myself to playing a solo game at least once a month.

* **Play a new system every month.** Last year, I played/ran fifteen different systems. Nine of those were new to me. I want to bump that up to at least twelve.

1am3ww9,How often do you guys use the official world of an RPG?,"Just wondering, cause I rarely do. Honestly, I rarely use pre-made worlds in general unless A. it's one I'm already intimately familiar with, or B. I'm running a module. The reason is quite simple, I know for certain that if I ran a campaign in the Forgotten Realms or Golarion, I'm going to get a lot of info wrong.

If I'm playing in a pre-made world and someone asks me where Dragonborns primarily live, I'd have no earthly idea, and whatever answer I give would be complete bullshit. Meanwhile, in a world of my own creation, I am the god of the world, what I say is gospel. If I say ""oh, Dragonborn can be found all over the country but they particularly gather around the east coast"", it doesn't matter if what I said was complete bullshit or not, it's now canon lore. There's no official book for someone to use to come in and ""um actually"" me, I AM the book.

Similarly, if I were to run a campaign set in Amestris or Fodlan, I could pretty decently answer any question they have. If someone asked me about the Ishvalans, I could do a moderately good job explaining their deal, their religion, their relationship with the Amestrians, etc. I might get some details wrong, but the overall explanation would be at least 70% accurate. If you were to ask me to explain Forgotten Realms elves, what's said in the PHB is all I could realistically be accurate about, the rest would either be completely wrong or accurate by accident.

I could probably just be confidently incorrect anyways and if anyone speaks up about it go ""Well, now it's this way now, I'm the DM"", but I do not have the balls to do that.

1d46nfd,"Have you ever been ""forced"" to play an RPG had zero interest in and the experience made you love the game?","My online group rotated in a bunch of games, and one that we added was Cyberpunk RED.

But I LOVE the people I game with, so I deciced to ""take one for the team"" and learn this new system that I had ZERO interest in. I was actually debating bowing out of the monthly CPR setting, but staying with the other games.

I asked my wife for the CPR rulebook for Chirstmas and we did session 0 the last weekend in December.

By April 2024, I owned all the books and it's my favorite RPG now.

RED is far less crunchy than 2020, and the VTT helps with the math. The lore is amazing. I love the cyber-psycho mechanic that prevents you from making an unstoppable cybernetic tank.

I'm so glad I tried the game. Makes me think what other games are out there that I dismissed that I may actually love.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x160b6a990>,rpg,1717082652.0
1il17v4,An RPG that allows for deep character customization?,"A friend of mine would like to be a dungeon master for the first time. 
He asked me for help because he would like to find a system for the adventure he has in mind because dnd 5e, which is what we currently use,  doesn't seem to fit. 

Basically it will be the story of a group of adventurers who discover that they are fallen gods and slowly regain their lost strength and power. 

He would like a system that allows a lot of flexibility and freedom in character creation so that we can use any deity we can think of. 

We had tried dungeon world in the past, but he doesn't like the system because it is too light in the fighting part, where he would like more crunch instead. 

I have heard of city of mist. I don't know it at all, but from what I've read around, although the theme is similar, I don't think it's suitable for telling this kind of story, since it should focus more on the conflict between human and mythos. I also don't know how far it deviates from dungeon world as mechanics. 
If any of you are familiar with it please tell me if I am wrong and if it would fit. 

To conclude so what he's looking for is something that leaves a lot of freedom or allows a lot of customization in the character creation phase and his abilities, but has a few more rules regarding combat and exploration. 
So something that is more crunchy than dungeon world, but doesn't get to the levels of pf2e, a system that I know he finds quite complex. 

What would you guys suggest to him? Is there such a thing? Or, in case you can't think of one, what system would you recommend to him that with a bit of reskin would allow a similar result to be achieved?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x160c312b0>,rpg,1739058343.0
1ag63aa,"How do you feel about the dozens, if not hundreds of hidden gems scattered across the much wider sea of DriveThruRPG and itch.io?","Even under the specific context of indie RPGs, some games have vastly more publicity than others. Some games have Kickstarters that pulled in tens or hundreds of thousands of USD, and have active Discord servers with hundreds or thousands of active users; these are the indie darlings that get frequently recommended here and there. Other games never had a successful Kickstarter at all, have a Discord server with a single-digit number of users, and have just a single writer working on them; and that does not stop them from being good. The bulk of DriveThruRPG and itch.io is mediocre, but a rare few specimens are exceptional.

As ever, word-of-mouth is a crapshoot. ""If you build it, they will come"" is a flat-out lie in many cases.

Over the past decade or so, I have come across, played, and run several highly obscure indie games that I have seen virtually nobody else talk about. Some of them have climbed in popularity by now, while others still languish in obscurity. I have also run and played my fair share of indie darlings; while some were good, others did not live up to the hype for me.

What has been your experience with the really, really obscure games, the ones that are all but unknown even by indie standards?

___

It is not **that** obscure (mostly because it is attached to a relatively more well-known system, and I do mean relatively), but one game I have gotten quite invested in as of late is [*Tailfeathers*/*Kazzam*](https://jimbozig.itch.io/tailfeathers). It is a grid-based tactical combat game set in a wizard school.

On the far more obscure end, I once saw an extremely ambitious D&D 4e heartbreaker called simply ""4.5"" (which is, admittedly, un-Google-able). It was hundreds upon hundreds of pages long, and had a wide variety of classes [and powers](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/351756476231974913/1202571577774833695/Encounter_Powers.png). The author had a fully automated framework for it in MapTool. I played through several encounters as a blaster caster. The game was surprisingly enjoyable and reasonably well-balanced, though the author admitted that blaster casters were overpowered in the current version. The monster abilities actually forced a good deal of variety in player tactics.

Sadly, the author lost all confidence and shelved the project, never to be seen again. It was unfortunate, especially since the game was already in a fully playable state. I still have the PDF of the rules, but I do not know if the author would want it to be disseminated, particularly when there were several updates and balance patches planned.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x160c332f0>,rpg,1706775213.0

For me I think having an understanding of D&D is useful for communicating with the many RPG players who are most familiar with it or a similar system and the artwork in those books is top tier.

Basically, I love making stuff. Building little vehicles and structures is hella fun! What could make it more fun is being able to turn what you build into a character/vehicle for a TTRPG. I guess there's not a great way to translate physically built model elements (or digital 3d models for that matter) into some kind of hard ruleset, but I'm curious what systems currently available do mech/spaceship/vehicle customization the best?

I know on the wargaming side, there are some LEGO-themed build-your-own-army games, but it seems a bit niche? Not that this would ever necessarily be super popular I guess, but it wasn't exactly what I hoped to find.
