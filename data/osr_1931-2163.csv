1evkr02,Discovering OSR ruined other RPG playstyles for me,"I have a background of about 7 years DMing 5e, but also World of Darkness games, Powered by the Apocalypse-like games etc. As a GM, I've basically struggled from the start, and often my struggles relate to adventure design, specifically making an interesting plot and designing a line through the adventure while leaving enough space and tools to play with to allow for player freedom. My plots never felt interesting, getting players to follow them was a pain (""my character is not interested in that"") and getting ""off the rails"" has always been scary for me, not because I'm afraid of improvising, but because once there's rails, that becomes constraining for that improvisation. And the fear of characters dying, both from players because they are very attached, and from me as it can derail the adventure. 

Discovering the OSR, it just feels more right. No grand plot but an interesting world to explore, from which a story evolves. Players being challenged themselves to be genuinely creative and resourceful and death isn't a nuisance that threatens the end the campaign, it's part of the design. A more player-driven outlook, so no more needing to convince players or characters to go on an adventure.  Admittedly these aspects might not be exclusive to OSR but the point stands. 

Knowing that this way of playing exists, makes it even more draining to prep for other games, and playing in such games can be frustrating. Knowing death isn't really on the table because nobody wants the campaign to end, just suddenly makes everything feel pointless? I don't want to meta game but when the GM clearly prepared a certain plot or adventure line, I can't help but be aware of that fact and have it influence my actions. I can't help but feel like, despite there being freedom within the boundaries of the adventure, there's still a fairly clear limit to freedom, and there's a rebellious side in me that finds that knowledge frustrating, like I'm forced to dance to someone elses tune. 

All of this frankly makes me feel a little alienated from the community at large, because this way of playing is massively popular (mostly due to 5e's success). All my friends play that way and like it, but as I've gotten frustrated with the playstyle, I feel less enjoyment playing or running those games. I wish I could fully share their enjoyment as I once did, because in the end that's the most valuable thing this hobby has given me. 

Does anyone relate to this experience?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x114042510>,osr,1724017145.0

1j5k9f6,"[PSA] Massive print cost increase coming to DriveThruRPG effective April 1, 2025","[DriveThruRPG](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/browse?ffiliate_id=2150725) and associated sites will soon increase cost of print-on-demand products from 10% to 80%, depending on print binding and location:

**EDIT: UPDATED ANNOUNCEMENT**

***Upcoming Print-on-Demand Book Price Changes – Effective April 1, 2025***

*We always want to keep print costs as low as possible, and it has been years since we passed any price increases through to our publishing partners.*

*However, our print supplier, Lightning Source/Ingram, has announced a price adjustment starting April 1, 2025, that will be reflected on DriveThru sites.*

***Key Changes***

* _Due to increasing supply costs in the US, **Black & White print costs in the US will increase significantly**, from around 20% for low-pagecount hardcover titles up to about 50% or slightly more for large hardcover books, and with softcover titles seeing an even greater increase._
* _**UK print costs for Black & White books will also increase**, but generally only by 3-4%._
* _**Standard Color print costs will increase**, by roughly 12-13% for US printing but only around 3% for UK printing._
* _On the whole, **Premium Color print costs will decrease slightly for US printing but increase slightly for UK printing.**_
     * _Example 1: A 180-page large premium hardcover currently costs $32.10 to print in the US; after April 1, that same title will drop to $27.80._
     * _Example 2: In the UK, the same 180-page book currently costs £20.23, which will increase to £20.93 starting in April._

Above will most likely lead to publishers increasing prices on the books, especially those who use at-cost pricing. I ordered all hardbacks from my wish-list, just in case. :)

I found this discussion quite interesting from the perspective of players and dms who are not interest/do not like OSR

The majority of the arguments go around “new players may find hard to navigate in OSR freedom, both in world building and rules” and also that OSR freedom may led to random stuff happening and players getting stuck in the story without knowing what to do while a storytelling adventure will always keep on track.

If could give 5 min of a look in this thread, what is your general opinion?

Do you agree with some of the criticism to OSR? Do you think most osr systems are bare bones and 90% the same thing just overlapping each other?

1hlgqap,"How to make ""being lost"" and ""finding your way"" interesting in RPG sessions?","Hello

My friend and I recently ran a session for our party in which they broke into a secret hideout made by a spy organisation. 


The conceit of the hideout was that it was underwater and that the ""corridors"" were essentially hidden. There was a map (not available to the party) and these air tunnels appeared to just be normal water and our idea of a ""puzzle"" for the hideout itself was them finding their way. Upon this actually playing out though it was actually just very unsatisfying. The players just went ""I walk with my hands out until its wet"" and we realised this essentially ""solved"" the puzzle. This wasnt an issue it was still a fun session, but its got me thinking, is there a more interesting way to do ""navigating"" in a d20 system than just rolling a dice for a ""navigation check""? This hideout example I think in retrospect was just a much more interesting piece of flavour than it was a useful puzzle, but I have always found it boring when I say ""you're lost in a forest"" I don't really have ways of facilitating anyone figuring something out or navigating in a way which doesnt feel all or nothing to the point where its not a challenge or its insurmountable. 


Has anyone got any recommendations of good blogs on this subject? Or does anyone have any good solutions for making the experience of ""being lost"" feel satisfying as a puzzle type challenge.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1142063f0>,osr,1735056852.0

Names are divided into chapters by either their intended use (e.g. divine names) or how they sound like (e.g. Anglish or Nörslik). The latter are based on how real-world names sound like but do not replicate them entirely (for historical names I recommend [Treasury of Archaic Names](https://www.acaeum.com/jg/OtherCompanies/RPGRealmTreasuryArchaicNames.html) and [The Everyone Everywhere List](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/89285/the-everyone-everywhere-list?affiliate_id=2150725)).

Nothing concrete yet, but I’m considering maybe putting together some thing like this and sort of a retro clone. I’m considering using the original blackmore rules combined with chainmail’s man to man combat.

The top comment has a bunch of discussion about OSR, rules-lite, etc. Do you feel the criticisms are valid? Of course, please don't be toxic; refrain from personal attacks, hand waving because you don't like what's being said.  

I agree with some of the criticisms; I do feel that many indie rules-lite systems miss the point of a rules lite ruleset; they might just throw in a d20 mechanic then cry ""rulings, not rules."" Rules-lite shouldn't mean all theme with a die roll slapped on.

I notice that rules-lite is kind of being conflated with narrative-driven games, Mork Borg was called a retro clone (it isn't), etc. so I do wonder whether some of these opinions are coming from folks who have read but not played some of these games.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x114386db0>,osr,1693946306.0

So, I’ll be running some Dragonlance, but grittier and nastier, sans metaplot. The setting though, more or less, will be a riff on canon.. and maybe some fanon.

Anyway, what I’m hoping for is a suitable RPG that runs quick and smooth, doesn’t have too many moving parts, and is especially friendly to the GM/DM side of things.

Tried 5e, briefly. A bit too complicated for my liking. Not quite gritty enough too. Didn’t mind the simple rules for proficiency, and advantage/disadvantage.

It would be nice to have fighters that pretty much just get better at fighting overall, and surviving of course. Thieves/rogues, maybe just sneak attack / backstab, and general sneakery, but wrapped up in as few class abilities / skills as possible (one is fine).

Just fighters, thieves, wizards and clerics would do. Minimal class abilities for all, preferred.

A thing I liked from DCC was magic being variable, also dangerous. In fact, a stripped back DCC might be damn close to ideal.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1143e7290>,osr,1696648436.0

1gqvepc,Micro OSR rpg length?,"
Greetings fellow ttrpg addicts!

How small should a micro rpg be? 
Where would you personally draw the line? 
I’d think anywhere from 1-10 double sided pages imo.

In my mind all rpg lengths should be “as long as they need be” Granted that can mean a whole hacking lot of things! But generally: Character creation, Conflict resolution, Combat rulings, and a fun few mechanics (DM tips are always welcomed too)

What do you all think?

Thank you for your time and thoughts!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11446edb0>,osr,1731553967.0

1iy4y9i,Lair of the Forgotten Queen - Made for the Shadowdark RPG - Kickstarter Live!,"Hey Dungeon delvers!

I have been having a ton of fun working on **Lair of the Forgotten Queen** and the Kickstarter is now live!!

This is my first time publishing an adventure (or rather, 4 adventures) and I would love your support to bring this project to life!

Plans for this smallish module designed for the Shadowdark RPG include:

* Four (4) dungeons in an easy to read outline format
* Associated maps (blank copy for VTT/players, room keyed for the GM)
* Minimum of 5 monsters, either unique or fun mutations of familiar classics
* Minimum of ~~3~~ 5 unique magic items
* Several minor NPCs with ties to the dungeons
* Rumors and adventure hooks to get the party started

The first 3 dungeons will be loosely linked together, ultimately leading to the 4 dungeon, the titular **Lair of the Forgotten Queen**. The idea is that this module can be used as a standalone adventure, or the way I'll likely use it, just dropping them into an existing game.

A little bit of story:

I would obviously love for for the Kickstarter to be successful, but even if it's not, I'm having a lot of fun, and I'll use the dungeons for my own game!

Hello everyone. I wanted to let you know about a new RPG adventure set in Irish myth and folklore. I recently released it on Amazon for physical books and on DTRPG for digital. It's called **Corruption of the Blood God**.

This a Game Master adventure is written for the *Monsters! Monsters!* & related games rules with a d6 system & saving rolls (e.g., *Tunnels and Trolls*). A rules summary is included in the appendices. It is designed for a party of 3 - 5 player characters of levels 1 - 3 (any class).

*""In a land covered by heather, bogs, mist and rolling hills, the stone circles watch … and whisper. Brave adventurers must learn why do villagers vanish near the mountains of Slieve Blahma? Is this related to recent roadside attacks? And why do some whisper of the god known as Crom Cruach, “the Bloody Crescent?” Clues can be learned from old stones, in passage tombs, from dangerous creatures of fae and the Otherworld, awakened corpses and even from the gods of this land.""*

The Corruption of the Blood God is an RPG adventure set in ancient Ireland with its gods, folklore and mythic creatures, including the Puca, the banshee, the dullahan, a mischievous clurichaun, a Wolf-man of Ossory and many more. Players explore an ancient land to discover clues about a mysterious threat. They can invoke the gods for blessings, such as the sea god Manannán, and the great raven queen known as the Morrígan. There is also an appendix that describes the Irish gods mentioned in the adventure.

This adventure includes 4 pre-generated player characters, 12 settlements, 115 NPCs, 60 random wilderness encounters and 72 rumour, all in \~ 110 pages with a colour interior\*.\*

1gplgdr,"FOREST BURIAL - Solo RPG, Fits in a Gum Case","I’ve been accumulating all of these plastic cases that come with my gum of choice, thinking that I could do something with them. I’ve also been wanting to make a super streamlined 2d6 solo rpg set in a dangerous magical forest. Finally it hit me to put these two ideas together.

[Forest Burial](https://nealyboy.itch.io/forest-burial)

Forest Burial is a solo Tunnel Goons hack made to fit in a commonly available gum case, along with your 2d6. The vibes are inspired by Cairn, Vermis, Princess Mononoke, and Shadow of the Colossus. There is a one sheet version for folks who don’t have or don’t want the plastic cae. It’s available for free right now of Itch, if that sounds at all interesting to you.

Here’s the set up:
You’re another fool on a quest to the center of the forest. The deeper you go, the greater the dangers will become. Ancient powers. Monstrous guardians. Strange landmarks. Villages make terrible pacts. Heroes die.

PS: The side benefit of using a gum case is that it makes your game nice and minty. Not enough minty RPGs in my opinion.

If you like doomed settlement games akin to Kingdom Death: Monster, then you should enjoy the mechanics in this multi session RPG adventure for the MÖRK Borg rules system.

In a world on the brink, a resilient hamlet faces a terrifying onslaught. Flesh-eating flies swarm the village each night, their insatiable hunger a constant threat. Players must lead their community, fortifying the barricade, tending to the fire, and maintaining morale. But their true test lies beyond the hamlet perimeter. Daily, they'll send brave souls into the desolate landscape to confront the evil that has brought this terror upon them.

This adventure started life as something I was playing around with for my RPG group and I never really intended for it to go much further than that. Naturally it escalated into something more, and I've thoroughly enjoyed the journey. I thought I would just share it here in the hope that people give it a go.

However, my group is all 5e players who don't have money to drop on a new rpg, want to learn a new system, and generally enjoy being entertained by a story they can interact with by doing the cool stuff their character sheet gives them. TL;DR: They would have no interest in playing Fantasy Trip.

Should I still get it even if I won't be playing it? If it's a 10/10 system with some ideas I can harvest and some advice on DMing Dungeon crawly games I'll get it, but if especially Into the Labyrinth is just some more system and Melee is the best part, I probably won't.

17qjjg7,"Check out ""Gods of the Forbidden North: Volume 1"" that I made over on DriveThruRPG! A 473-page wilderness hex-crawl in the old-style on the arctic frontier. For Old-School Essentials and B/X D&D!","*Gods of the Forbidden North* is a massive, three-volume mega-adventure series written for the *Old-School Essentials: Advanced Fantasy* tabletop role-playing game by Necrotic Gnome. It details a **campaign setting**, a **wilderness hex-crawl**, a **sprawling underworld** connecting to multiple entrances on the surface, and most importantly, an **enormous megadungeon**.

* **Volume 1**: The first book covers the arctic frontier's settlements, cultures, religions, and its vast wilderness regions. It includes an urban starter quest and five low-level dungeons.
* **Volume 2**: The second book details the underworld below the continent's surface and six mid-level dungeons.
* **Volume 3**: The third book explores Castle Thar-Gannon, its upper halls, mysterious towers, and underground levels. It also includes the Cyclopean City deep under the earth, which leads to the entire adventure's climax: the Tesseract of Time.

The first volume is designed for a **heroic party of 6-8 characters** to begin at **1st level** and reach a minimum of **5th level** by the book's conclusion, although most parties will hit **7th-8th level** if all wilderness encounters are exhausted. Though the mega-adventure was originally designed as a sandbox, it also supports episodic ""adventure path"" play-styles, as well.

To me, the rules are somewhat complex and not intuitively laid out. I’ve thought about creating my own cheat sheet for the game and changing the rules I don’t like, but before I sort through all 152 pages to do that, I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for lighter systems about Rome. Thanks in advance for any recommendations!

I'm very happy to present my latest game: ***Ruthless Heavens, Boundless Fate***! Come [check it out on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1775185920/ruthless-heavens-boundless-fate) now, you can even download a quickstart and start playing it right away!

***Ruthless Heavens, Boundless Fate*** is an epic Role-Playing Game of cosmic adventure and power cultivation inspired by the LitRPG genre. In it, players play as **Ascendants**, powerful characters that due to a combination of talent, luck and sheer determination have become the de-facto rulers of their nations. Unfortunately for them, this means little in the cosmic scale, and they quickly find out that they are at the bottom of the power ladder. Their planet has just been introduced to the Path of Ascendancy by the Ruthless Heavens, and as such the rest of the Nolurian Sector is now aware of its existence. It falls to them to become strong enough to protect their homeland, exploring the sector for new opportunities while sending them resources so they can eventually be strong themselves. Through hard work and fortuitous encounters they will have the chance to do so, while reaching new heights of power and cultivation.

***Ruthless Heavens, Boundless Fate*** features:

* A robust D20 ruleset compatible with most OSR systems and games.
* A gazetteer of the Nolurian Sector, exploring the main locations of interest, such as the Wandering City of Yeross, the different factions and their conflicts, and the motivations behind the mysterious cosmic force known as the Ruthless Heavens.
* Detailed character creation, with 5 different original ancestries, 8 classes, 10 unique lineages, random background generation, and rules to improve your soul, body, and bloodline, which are at the core of character progression.
* A unique skill system with 100 different powers that you can personalize and evolve, combining them into your signature power set of 9 active skills. Found a cool new skill? Replace an old one with it!
* Living Weapon rules to find and evolve your unique artifact, feeding it different resources that you must gather during your travels across the Nolurian Sector, and tailoring its powers to your specific wants and needs.
* Different pre-made locations such as Trials, Hunting Grounds, or Divine Decrees, for you to explore and investigate, each with their different challenges, events, encounter tables, and more.
* Hexploration rules to randomly generate different locations across different planets. 
* Rules to expand your settlement between adventures, with a collection of buildings and facilities that grant your character a series of benefits. 
* The most exhaustive collection of solo rules and tools ever found in a Blackoath game, allowing you to play the game solo or co-op!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1143e58b0>,osr,1715878956.0

tahrx0,What’s the best bit(s) of RPG related advice you’ve read or received? For playing or GMing. Things that radically improved your game.,"For me I think it was the distinction between Intent and Approach for player actions; which I picked up from the Angry GM. I won’t adjudicate anything anymore until I have this info, and as soon as I absorbed the necessity to have it I was surprised to see how often either Approach or Intent are omitted from actions taken by players. 

The result of enforcing it has encouraged a very visceral connection with the fiction of the game world, and empowered player characters.

Another would be that Logic will always trump mechanics. I used to feel that I must either find or create a system that polices behaviour in such a way that no stupid or illogical things can happen. But realizing that most important part of the RPG “engine” is the human mind, or Logic, the responsibility for verisimilitude falls on everyone at the table. (A big reason why I prefer the OSR is the emphasis on the Human Factor)

Since introducing this to all my groups, I ceased constantly running into weird mechanical exploits that abuse or ignore the physics of the setting.

1djth8f,"OTGH: a free, rules-light rpg for on-the-go one-shots!","Hello everyone! After building a minimalist DM kit, i wanted to create a system for it, so i could play simple one-shots anywhere, with people new to the hobby!

My goal was to create a ruleset that is easy to run, that rewards narrative encounters and makes players jump into the adventure as soon as possible: character creation, skill checks and coming up with stat blocks had to be as quick and smooth as possible.

OTGH's characters only have 3 stats, but they keep their depth by rolling different dice depending on how ""in-character"" an action is: a knight might tank damage better than a rogue, but rogues are unmatched in being stealthy! Some characters might have similar sheets, but totally different roles!

The fun twist is that each stat has its own HPs, and different attacks deal different types of damage: an orc charging a barbarian isn't as scary as the same orc dealing BODY damage to a mage. A bunch of cultists might easily break a warrior's MIND, so now the wizard has to defend the party with his arcane knowledge. This mechanic forces the group to work together, to exploit the current enemy's weaknesess: an ogre might be easier to trick rather than to fight. Maybe the warlock had enough of their SOUL attacks missing, and now starts throwing punches?

The system is free on [DriveThruRpg](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/484264/OTGH-a-rpg-on-the-go?affiliate_id=2212730). It contains the core rules, a DM guide, some advance rules (wild magic, summoning minions...), a monster manual full of weird creatures i made and a short adventure to start playing right away. If you can't be bothered making an account, DM me and i'll send the PDFs!

q4jijn,Is random weather in role-playing games too random? Using a simple Markov chain to make RPG weather more realistic,"I originally posted this in r/DnDBehindTheScreen and someone suggested posting in r/osr as you might also find these Random Weather tables useful.

Weather is important in role-playing games. This is especially true in wilderness and seafaring exploration adventures, where poor weather can affect navigation, travel speed, and visibility. Nearly all RPGs provide some way to randomly generate weather. One of the problems with random weather tables is that they tend to be “too random”. Rolling once a day on a random weather table can result in the weather jumping unrealistically between different types (Storm! Cold Weather! Hot Weather! Storm! etc). Real weather isn’t completely random all the time. For example, mid-latitude weather tends to flip between regimes of unsettled stormy weather and regimes of settled weather. When the weather is unsettled things do indeed feel random as the passage of storms and fronts bring rain, snow, and strong winds. But when the weather is settled we can get the same conditions day after day, for example, during a summer heatwave or a winter cold spell (both of which are often associated with anticyclonic blocking conditions). 

**“Less random” random weather using a simple Markov chain**

A different way to create random weather and yet retain realistic variations is to expand on the idea of the weather flipping between “Settled” and “Unsettled” regimes using a method known as a Markov chain. The basic idea is that there is one roll per day to determine if the weather remains Settled or Unsettled, or if it flips to the other weather regime. There is then a second roll to determine the weather type. The second roll is done every day during an Unsettled weather regime to mimic the passage of storms and weather fronts. During a Settled regime, only one roll is made for the weather type, which then persists until the weather flips to the Unsettled regime again.

The tables below describe a method for generating realistic spring or fall (autumn) weather for a location similar to Southern England. Hopefully you’ll find this fairly simple to follow (or at least no more complicated than other RPG methods) - let me know in the comments.

**Spring and Fall Weather Tables**

1. Roll 1d20 each day to determine if the weather remains Settled or Unsettled, or if it changes regime.

|**Roll 1d20**|**Settled Weather Regime**|**Unsettled Weather Regime**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1-15|Weather remains Settled|Weather remains Unsettled|
|16-20|Weather becomes Unsettled|Weather becomes Settled|

2. Now determine the type of weather, which depends on regime:

For a **Settled Weather Regime**:

At the start of the regime, roll 1d20 to determine the type of Settled Weather. The type of Settled Weather persists until the weather becomes Unsettled.

|**Roll 1d20**|**Type**|**Conditions**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1-5|Cool & Foggy|No rain, morning fog then clear, calm, cool|
|6-10|Clear & Cool|No rain, clear, calm or light wind, cool|
|11-15|Clear & Warm|No rain, clear, calm or light wind, warm|
|16-20|Cloudy & Warm|No rain or light showers, cloudy, light wind, warm |

For an **Unsettled Weather Regime**:

Roll 1d20 each day to determine the type of Unsettled Weather.

|**Roll 1d20**|**Type**|**Conditions**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1-6|Clear & dry|No rain, clear, light wind, cool|
|7-11|Rain showers|Rain showers, cloudy, light wind, cool|
|12-17|Rain|Rain, cloudy, light to moderate winds, cool|
|18-20|Storm |Heavy rain, cloudy, moderate to strong winds, cool|

More details of the method can be found in the following [blog post](https://copperpieces.blogspot.com/2021/09/is-random-weather-in-role-playing-games.html).

1daany9,"Doppelsold, the squad based tactical tabletop RPG ","I want to show you Doppelsold, the rules set my friends and I are currently developing together! It's heavily inspired by the video game battle brothers. It is a squad based tactical tabletop RPG game that is played with two players, each controlling three separate characters called retainers. You will fight and die through a harsh medieval world filled with a great variety of monsters.

What makes us special:

* Our Doppelsold ruleset is designed for 2 players and 1 DM, so scheduling conflicts are a goner. I always wanted to play a ttrpg where you can control multiple characters and have a sense of battle between two factions. It is not fun to have one turn and then wait 30 minutes only to miss your next sword hit and have to wait again. With 3 retainers per player, 6 in total you are always in the midst of battle, always can do something, must do something. If one of them gets knocked out or stunned the others can still act. Overall you have more actions to do epic or funny things, it makes the whole game more engaging. You will care deeply for some retainers because they can become heroes and the tales of their deeds will live on even after their gruesome death. 
* Our Monsters are fun to play for the DM and have more than 1 action they can use ;). One of the weak points of the king of ttrpgs is the simplistic monster design that is not very fun to run or fight. Older editions had a more interesting enemy design with different roles and we wanted to revive that but also add to it. The most fun situations arise when you are confronted with a choice. As a player in Doppelsold you will have to make choices every moment of the game. Controlling enemies will be the same. Having a monster where you can choose from multiple actions is fun. Therefore our design goal correlates to that and our monsters have many interesting (and nasty) actions in store.
* We used the concept of morale and routing for retainers and enemies to keep fights suspenseful. It is super intense when half of your retainers flee and the fight seems already lost, but then in a last stand effort they come back and turn the tide of battle again. It is way more engaging and realistic to have enemies flee and not always fight to the death. So Doppelsold gives a more realistic depiction of combat with morale as a factor. 
* Doppelsold Weapons and Spellcasting give the player a plethora of actions from which to choose. As written before, making decisions is fun, therefore players should have options available to them, not only “I attack”.  The gear you will find determines your retainers focus and specialization (class). You can switch out the gear and turn a fighter with shield and sword into a magic focused retainer. Everybody can use every gear, mixing them is encouraged. For these purposes we designed many gear cards you can easily print. (They are very pretty!)

Here's where I'm at right now:

* It will be a d6 system similar to Maze Rats, but probably not 2d6. I'm going for a flat distribution rather than a bell curve, to make the math more transparent and easier to calculate.
* Some of my favorite parts from Knave, like item slots, will be moving over.
* Melee attacks will automatically deal damage, minus armor ratings, similar to what we see in Into the Odd. Maze Rats *sort of* did this already, but armor was so high that attacks would frequently deal 0 damage, which slowed things down.
* 36 weird, flamboyant character archtypes, like the Lantern Witch, Cauldroneer, or Skeleton King. Each gets a few fun abilities as they level. Definitely some inspiration from Troika here. HP remains fairly low and lethality remains high.
* A hugely expanded toolkit section. This was one of the big selling points of Maze Rats, so the goal is to make it even better.

1ck41j7,Slay & Plunder (OSR Sword & Sorcery RPG) Open Playtest,"For those who are up for some playtesting, I have an OSR game that is ready for outside input. It's called, Slay & Plunder. The rules are structured around B/X and should work well with other game materials that share the same lineage.

The major differences are the explicit setting, which is inspired by sword & sorcery fiction as well as  Germanic and Slavic folklore, and the dice mechanics, which are unified around the venerable d6. Specifically, a 2d6 on-or-under roll is used throughout. It's simple and consistent. It's also a natural fit for descending AC.

Other features of the rules include the following:

* Very fast character creation; not Troika fast, but fast.
* All four classes are available; cleric, fighter, magic-user, and thief.
* XP from monster kills > XP from loot. Leave no survivors.
* Spell point magic system.
* Slot based encumbrance.
* Variable weapon damages and features.
* Some entirely new (and some slightly tweaked) spells and monsters.

*Edit: To make the game more accessible, the ""Grimm"" bit has been removed. There's still plenty of bloodshed for those who are good (or not) with a bit of gore.*

I should also mention, there's no artwork and only minimal formatting at this time.

zm3br1,New to actually running OSR - Would it be fine to swap XP for monsters out for XP for gold? (Basic Fantasy RPG),"Hello! I've been scouring this sub a lot lately and I'm familiar with lots of stuff going on in the OSR scene, but my actual experience is running a whopping 2 games of Mork Borg. It was awesome, but it doesn't feel like the system to run a long term campaign (for me). 

A while back I actually played in an OSE campaign and I really disliked it at the time. But that was because I was coming from 5e only and didn't know what I was getting into. There were definitely certain aspects I liked, and it felt more ""true"" to the game because we were dungeon crawling and managing logistics - but I hated how squishy I was and was basically incapable of thinking outside my character sheet. I still like running 5e, but I've got the OSR itch, so to speak. 

I picked up a few BFRPG books and the Morgansfort module, and I'm excited to r read through and get a feel for how old school should be run. The one thing I really liked about OSE and not so much BFRPG was XP - specifically XP for gold. Which brings me to my question in the title. Also, if anyone else has any hacks they utilize for BFRPG, do share.

Anyway, I've been running a long term 5e campaign that I've tried to old school-ify but I finally realized that I should just... play an actual old school system instead of trying to beat 5e into submission. Guess I'm just happy to he part of the crew.

u05zl2,What's your RPG origin story?,"I'm old enough to have played D&D during the '80s, but it didn't work out that way. I greatly enjoyed the Saturday morning cartoon, but my first direct exposure to RPGs in any form came via my lifelong love of video gaming: Dragon Warrior (aka Dragon Quest) in 1989, followed by Final Fantasy in 1990.

Not long after Final Fantasy, I came across a copy of the Moldvay basic book (all by itself) at a thrift store. I was captivated, but wanted more details and some of those crazy dice the book described.  Unfortunately, I lived in a remote ski resort town with nothing even close to a proper game store. 

Eventually, I spotted a full-page D&D ad on the back cover of a comic book and sent the attached coupon in for a free 1990 Mail Order Hobby Shop catalog. A few weeks later, I finally had my dice and was fumbling through my first game with friends, kicking off a Mystara-based campaign that would run through the end of high school.

Around this same time, I also found my way into some local AD&D 1E games run by older gamers who didn't mind having an annoying teen around every now and then. I started reading Dragon magazine (with issue 175, November 1991) and shortly thereafter purchased my first ever brand new rulebook, the D&D Rules Cyclopedia.

g93cuu,Basic Fantasy RPG Appreciation Post,"I hope this isn't flagged as a self promotion - I'm not in any way associated with BFRPG or Chris Gonnerman.  I just wanted to show some appreciation for my favorite basic rpg.

What's good about BFRPG?

It doesn't hurt that:

* It's free,
* all of the suppliments are free
* all of the adventures are free

Does free = good?  Not always, but I think it does in this case.

If you look on the forums of their website, you'll find that they're fairly active, especially in the workshop.  It reminds me an open source community, such as what you see in software development.   The collaborative manner in which they put together adventures and modules is really cool.

Mechanically, it is most similar to b/x, although the changes that they make are changes that I prefer.  The game works, and is very complete, with a lot of quality supplements.

One of my favorite adventures on the site is actually a collection of six or so adventures all written for a competition - which was to write an adventure for the same map.

There is a  lot more I could write, but I'll just say - check it out.

Edit: I want to also mention that the author has a history of publishing free materials, including [several free novels](https://tower.gonnerman.org/fiction/).  Really cool.

Edit 2: I have to admit that I liked the art of some other systems better, at first, but the art of this one has grown on me, to the point that I like it the best - and I like that the artists have retained their rights to use their art elsewhere, if they want.

Hey everyone! I got a new podcast!

Weird Games and Weirder People is the first RPG podcast that’s not about RPGs!
It’s about the weird and wonderful people behind these games!

I sit down with game designers, artists, editors, publishers, podcasters and other creators of the independent RPG scene and talk about being weird, about the weirdness in the world, about art, artists, creativity and ao much more.

And as we talk, as we get to know each other, our passions, obsessions and, why not, philosophy, we get to know their work a little bit better as well!

We already have 11 episodes released with a great list of guests including Donn Stroud, Evlyn Moreau, Alan Bahr, Joey Royale, Ava Islam, and many more.

And we still have many more amazing creators who are coming soon to share a little bit of their weirdness with us, including some “rockstars” of the RPG space like Chirs McDowall, Kelsey Dionnes, Michael Curtis, and many others!

So listen up and get weird with us!

1) we are collecting funds for publishing **Beyond Corny Groń - Adventurer's Guide**: a sandbox adventure setting in a world heavily inspired by legends from the Polish mountains, folk songs of bold highwaymen, and romantic tales about Hidden Things;

&#x200B;

[Front cover project \(with Polish title, but it will available in English too\)](https://preview.redd.it/zrfsyeiyzgg91.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc2c9b5ced6671b803f4a3a94ce59d5f55d2afbe)

2) the purpose of writing the Guide is to capture and present **Polish legends, folklore, and the mood of the Tatra and the Carpathian Mountains**, with a proper dose of **weirdness, whimsy, and adventure** in the form of TTRPG material;

3) to support these efforts, visit [the Nerd Sirens shop](https://nerdsirens.pl/sklep/gb/english/96-corny-gron.html) and buy an already-made and finely printed game, Corny Groń, a solo RPG set among the Polish mountains, where the Guide will lead you very soon. We will send it to you right away and we will use the profits from the sale to pay for illustrations, editing, design, and English translation of the Guide;

[One of the Corny Groń's fey inhabitant](https://preview.redd.it/5l6fa1f10hg91.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=5352901d05126bf2795379c106392fbec4528d76)

4) if, for some reason, you don’t want the printed solo game, or you want to check it out before buying—Corny Groń can be found on the [Nerd Sirens itch.io](https://nerd-sirens.itch.io/corny-gron), where you can also pay for the digital version as much as you think is right. The profits from this sale will also contribute to the budget for the ""sandbox"" Guide.

I’s quite simple, isn't it? As for the other details—the cost of publishing the Guide (the aforementioned illustrations, editing, design, and English translation) in a digital version is around 1000 euros. Any surplus will allow us to fast-start the production of the printed release (we are thinking about hard, cloth binding, and hot-stamping). Otherwise, we will cover the cost of printing from what the Guide itself collects later in itchfund.

**The Guide will contain**:

\* a mountain map generator

\* tables for random places and encounters

\* descriptions of folks, creatures, legends, and factions.

At the moment, **the Guide is about 430,000 characters of descriptions, tables, and statistics tailored for use with OSRs** (Knave, OSE) and other games similar to D&D. To capture the folklore mood, we’ve asked Ala Wiśniewska for some new hand-made linocuts, a sample of which can be found attached. By the way—**when you buy a printed Groń, you can also buy hand-made prints of her illustrations, and they will be shipped together with the printed copy of the game** ;)

**Thank you in advance for all your support for our project**—by buying the solo game, but also by sharing the good news or passing a good word to your friends.

19aabeq,Two scenarios for the Warlock! RPG,"I've written and published on DriveThruRPG two scenarios for the Warlock! RPG by Greg Saunders/Fire Ruby Designs. The Warlock!

It is easy to convert between Warlock!, WFRP, Troika!, AFF2e, and B/X et al.

The newest scenario is [Throne of Bone: The Wight King's Tomb](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/466754/Throne-of-Bone-The-Wight-Kings-Tomb) which is a dungeon-based scenario involving plenty of environmental hazards and fun-house elements with a fun variety of menacing undead imprisoned within. 

The first scenario I wrote is entitled [Drum of Water](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/455252/Drum-of-Water) and is an exploration-based scenario where the players venture across a landscape to recover a lost oracle's writings while encountering a band of hobgoblins.

1aeoo7t,Layout design for a Suburban Gothic RPG,"Hey folks, my Suburban Gothic RPG The Lost Bay is getting closer to its physical release. I've talked about it here a few times, but lately I've been reflecting a lot on the process that lead to its final form, in terms of layout design. I've shared about this in other spaces folks have told me that was useful, so I figured I should share it here as well.

https://preview.redd.it/7uftqhjvwkfc1.jpg?width=2910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e65a6566f86af59943bdfda940e64daf108d078

  
The Lost Bay tabletop RPG is set in 199X. It hits a Suburban Gothic vibe. You're not kids on bikes. You're young adults, hot messes with weird powers. The setting is a haunted and decaying, stuck in time, where immortals and horrors roam free. The game takes inspiration from both late 80s/90s media (horror, dark fantasy) and urban cultures. Some of the playable classes hint at punks, metalheads, goths. That's why at first I was tempted to lay out the game as a punk zine from that era. That would have made so much sense. But I’ve found this option a bit too prescriptive in terms of mood. I'd like the game to have a strong flavor but to be welcoming to other folks' imagination and cultural references. 

  
Plus, let’s be honest, there’s already one Mörk Borg that draws from punk zines. It’s a stellar book, and I could hardly do as a good layout as the one Johan Nohr did.

  
So instead I picked another (art?) direction. I’ve been parsing instruction manuals from that “era”. Commodore, Atari. Electronic parts catalogs. Simple layouts, lots of whitespace. Grids, grids, grids.

&#x200B;

[References](https://preview.redd.it/45owskb8ykfc1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=a572475c6ab748f526db866dcc9e208cc1729603)

[Playable class spread](https://preview.redd.it/2tgpl3j0ykfc1.jpg?width=2910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6c3c1290477693e399da7d35a867a6761efa757)

  
What I’m trying to emulate is that black and white technical feel, like if The Lost Bay was actually a book from the mid ‘90s, and the copy you have was a badly photocopied, and partially worn out duplicate. Looks technical but it’s a bit corrupted, it’s been mutated by the dark forces at work in the game. I’m still fine tuning things but I’m happy with this balance that gives the books flavor but makes the text readable and fairly easy to structure.

  
Mothership has been another source of inspiration. Its layout design influenced TLB with two things: the choice of having black and white inners, and the way art is used throughout the books. Mothership doesn’t have “spot” art, but only cool, kick ass, explosive art. And this contributes to conveying the mood of the game so much. I’ve decided to follow a similar path, in TLB art fills at least a third of a page, when it’s present it’s super visible and informs notably the text. I hope the Kickstarter campaign will be a success and allow me to commission more art to TLB artist Evangeline Gallagher, because frankly her art does 90% of the layout.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ixlnvto2ykfc1.jpg?width=2910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7abd7396e5a7e1344d6510241392e68b5ff9feb4

  
If the books inners are black and white, the covers are in color. Cloud Empress by Watt has been highly influential in the way TLB covers are designed. With CE, Watt achieves an incredible unity throughout variety and manages to establish a strong sense of what the books are about, right from the covers. The covers are a statement: eerie world,  ‘70s flavored retro future, amazing creatures.

&#x200B;

[Cloud Empress you probably all know](https://preview.redd.it/9njtlhucykfc1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fd05829d2ebcc34512133ce89dd4b97f90e00ed)

  
I’m trying to build something similar with TLB and have the three core booklet covers convey a sense of the game, establishing unified layout structure, headings, and fonts.

&#x200B;

I’m super excited about The Lost Bay going to print soon, hopefully, it’s been a work of years, if this kind of post is useful, I'll try and share something about game design. TLB borrows from many indie/OSR rpgs and I'd be glad to talk about that.

I'm working on something that's very 'low fantasy', non-magical, and I need traps (or trap inspiration). Because of the low fantasy/non-magical thing, said traps basically need to work in the real world (ignoring the obvious questions of why would anyone fill a dungeon with traps...).

So think - 

* Cunning uses of pits
* Mechanisms that shoot / slice / crush
* Acid, water, fire, oil - real world materials
* Pivots / deadfalls, etc

I can think of the components, but my mind isn't devious enough to come up with how to put them *together*, and I'm hoping there's a source that'll help, even if it's like, 50% of the material (e.g. Grimtooth's Traps maybe?).

For those of you who still haven't jumped into **Sacrifice**, my dark fantasy OSR game heavily inspired by **Berserk**, I've just created a PDF bundle! you can now get the core rulebook, plus the scenarios expansion and the first issue of the official zine at a discounted price! [https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/450388/](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/450388/) 

 

**Sacrifice Features:**

* An OSR D20 ruleset easily compatible with other retroclones.
* A classless character creation system, complete with skills, feats and much more.
* As a Branded, your character is above average, capable of dealing with many opponents at once and surviving what would be certain death for others. This makes Sacrifice ideal for 1-on-1 play (one GM, one PC), although standard group play is of course possible, and even solo, thanks to the full set of GM-less rules and procedures included.
* Interesting and rich combat, with critical hit and fumble tables, morale rules, exciting Combat Maneuvers, dueling, and more.
* A feudal, human-centric ruthless world with no magic but full of demonic evil and corrupted institutions, centered around No Man’s Land, a setting strongly influenced by Kentaro Miura’s Berserk, complete with gear lists, bestiary, and a gazetteer.
* Detailed travel and hex-based exploration rules, with encounter tables that change depending on the current hex’s situation: is there a battle going on? Is it a war-torn, devastated place? Is it one of the few untouched corners left in No Man’s Land? Or perhaps you found a pocket of civilization? All these affect what you can expect to find in a hex.

16dvazx,Simplifying Travel and Exploration in My Basic Fantasy RPG game – Seeking Advice,"Hey guys,

I'm just one or two sessions away in my Basic Fantasy RPG campaign from ending the current dungeon and story arc, and I wanted to chat about making travel and exploration a smoother, less complicated experience. Perhaps something inspired by [DungeonCraft's ""The Bone Road""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovuc4CHudGQ), I'm aiming for something simple and engaging without getting into the complexities of a full-blown hexcrawl.

Here's the deal: I'm not looking to slow down the game with intricate details or extensive map-making. Instead, I want to keep things moving while still capturing that OSR feel. So, I'm reaching out for some practical advice.

1. **Dealing with Random Encounters:** How do you handle those unexpected surprises during travel? Any tricks to keep them interesting but not overly complex? Was thinking of creating d30 tables depending on the area being explored. But I guess I'm drawing blanks in this regard.
2. **Time & Distance:** What are your go-to rules or methods for determining travel times between places? How do you keep distances manageable without losing immersion?
3. **Terrain & Navigation:** Do you have any ways to make different terrains and landmarks matter without diving too deep into rules and charts? How about simplifying navigation?
4. **Supplies & Resources:** Tracking provisions can be a pain. Any streamlined methods to handle this without micromanagement?
5. **Exploration Rewards:** What's your approach to rewarding players for exploring without resorting to exhaustive maps or intricate puzzles?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this or on any experiences, and any house rules or systems you've used. Let's brainstorm together to create a travel and exploration system that's both approachable and inline with an OSR feel.

Thanks a ton for sharing your insight, guys.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11521deb0>,osr,1694230910.0
184peia,PSA: LotFP has sexual violence built into the core rules,"Lamentations of the Flame Princess has >!rape, genital mutilation!< and sexual violence built into the core rules/mechanics, in the random tables in the ""Summon"" spell. Following Rules as Written, you may be ""forced"" (or at least asked) to roleplay through these acts of sexual violence.

Why post this PSA? I believe, due to the nature of sexual violence and its affect on people and society, that anything containing sexual violence should be clearly labeled as such. Especially with RPG's, where you might be asked to role-play through sexual violence, I believe that it needs to be explicitly cleared with everyone involved.

I regularly see people recommending LotFP along side Basic Fantyasy RPG, OSE, Swords & Wizardry, etc, without making it clear that LotFP has these components of sexual violence built into its core rules, and the others do not. I think a lot of people must not be aware of this, and so I'm posting this so people are aware and can make their own decisions fully informed. Again, this is not just part of the setting of LotFP, it is part of the Core Rules.

For me, it's important that I can hand a player or potential player the ""Core Rulebook"" or ""Players Handbook"" and NOT have them exposed to descriptions of >!rape or genital mutilation!<. I have friends that have been >!raped, and some that have been molested as children!<, and these kinds of descriptions and reminders are traumatizing to them. So it's important to me that they are clearly labeled.

LotFP states ""18+ Explicit Content"", but I'm guessing most people (including me), expect it to mean more ""sexual content and innuendo"" and less ""sexual violence"". I wish Raggi was more clear about what is meant by ""18+ Explicit Content"".

Just to be clear, in order to trigger these mechanics you need to have a character cast the spell ""Summon"", fail a check or two, and then roll just right on the random tables for the spell. There is a good chance most people playing LotFP have never seen these mechanics in action. Also, as a side note, the ""Summon"" spell encourages human sacrifice, in that it will provide a bonus to the caster for some of the random rolls.

The section in question is in the free ""LotFP Weird Fantasy Role-Playing - Player Core Book:Rules & Magic"" (file name LotFPRulesMagicFreeNoArt.pdf)? Here is a quote from that pdf, from under the Summon spell in the Spell Descriptions (pages 134-143, the exact quote coming from pages 141-142 in the subsection 6:""Lust of a Betrayed Lover""):

""All characters within the local area (to be deter- mined by the situation) roll 1d6. Those that roll a 1 are at fault for the situation. All characters not at fault will become allies in the drive to hunt down, subdue, >!and mutilate the genitals !<of all who are at fault. After this is done, all who are not at fault must make a saving throw versus Magic. Those who fail will seek to kill the parties at fault, and all who stand in their way of doing so. The effect ends only when all of the characters at fault have been dealt with, although they will not be hostile with any of the characters present who are not at fault , even if they were hostile or longtime enemies before Summon was cast. If nobody is at fault, then things will get ugly.

It currently is linked from [lotfp.com](https://lotfp.com) and is on DriveThruRPG

Edit: I kind of feel like those who are saying ""It's LotFP and Raggi - It should be obvious what it's going to contain"" are being purposefully obtuse. I wouldn't be surprised if LotFP is in the top 20 OSR games recommended by people on this site - but it's the ONLY game commonly recommended that contains any sexual violence in the core rules. Hence this PSA post.

Edit 2: I really dislike moralizing regarding violence in games, because I feel it leads to silly and pointless quagmires. That said, there are real world scenarios where violence can have a  pragmatic purpose. For instance, defending ones family from a murderer, or defending your country from a conquering force. But there is never a scenario where sexual violence is pragmatic - it is always sadistic, meant to tear down, subvert, violate and destroy. That is why it's treated differently.

Edit 3: This post got way more attention than I expected. I want to make it clear, I am opposed to censorship and support Freedom of Speech. This wasn't a ""call to action"", but if I was going to make a suggestion or request, it would be that when you recommend LotFP, include a warning that it contains sexual violence. You can link to this post if you want.

Anyway, I'm done here for now. This post is way too long. I'm going to spend my time on things more enjoyable, like looking at the newest settings and OSE adaptations!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11521e4b0>,osr,1701044211.0
16rub4e,Question about creating/porting a custom race for Basic Fantasy RPG (especially from DnD 5e)?,"So I'm getting into TTRPGs. I've wanted to dabble in the OSR scene for awhile, especially since I feel it'll be a bit easier to learn with not many rules to worry about. That and it'll be good for playing solo, as well, if I wanna mess with things by myself. (BFRPG is free and has more support so thus why I'm focusing on the game here). This is more of a question for after when I'm used to handling the basic races. **My main question is this: is there a certain way of going about it? Is there a specific format to follow when creating the text description for a homebrew race?**  


**As for trying to convert an existing race** (offical/homebrew) for, say, DnD 5e, **how would I go about handling things such as traits? Should I simply add an equivalent feature in the ""Special Abilities"" section?** I know I'll also have to keep in mind making things balance so there's nothing wonky going on stat-wise (""oops, I made the wood elves too OP."").   


**So as an example**, I'm considering adding **Burmecians** (a kind of ratfolk from *Final Fantasy IX*). It would be heavily inspired by u/AchilliesFroste's homebrew text (This can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/64hipi/5e_ffix_inspired_race_burmecianratfolk/) or in **link #3**).

p2d45v,Thoughts on Numberless RPG System,"I'm starting to create a numberless RPG system that will use descriptive adjectives instead of numerical stats for both character descriptions and obstacles. Of course there is still dice for determining outcomes semi-randomly.

I just wanted to see if this OSR community is interested and hear your thoughts about the idea, possible pitfalls, pros and cons.

My idea is that it would eliminate the guesswork in converting numbers to narrative elements but wouldn't be so narrative based that there's no basis for logical outcomes.

15jy8hd,Heroic Legendarium is DriveThruRPG Deal of the Day on August 7th,"Hi everybody,

My book of 1E AD&D expansions and house rules The Heroic Legendarium will be DriveThruRPG’s “Deal of the Day” tomorrow (Monday August 7th, starting at 10:00am CST for 24 hours) and the pdf version will be $7.20, down from its normal price of $17.99. 

https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/357539

The book is branded as OSRIC for legal reasons but in practice is pure “Gygaxian”1E, consisting of both my preferred fixes to various known problem areas in the 1E rules (psionics, initiative, weapon specialization, the Unearthed Arcana classes) and a ton of new material in the “old-school” spirit, some adapted from Gygax’s post-TSR games (joss, knacks & quirks, bard spellsongs), some extrapolated from things he said he wanted to do with AD&D but never got around to (new classes - mountebank, savant, etc), and some that’s original to me but strives to maintain the same feel and spirit of the 1978-83 era of the game, plus some essays and design tips. The book was compiled over many years of play and testing so everything in it is practical and play-focused. 

I can just about guarantee anyone who plays or likes 1E AD&D will find stuff here to add to their games, and people who play OSE Advanced Fantasy, Labyrinth Lord AEC, or 2E AD&D probably will as well. 5E players not so much, but maybe the material in this book might inspire you to take another look at 1E? 

Here’s a nice in-depth blog review from last year, so you don’t need to just take my word for it: 
http://vorpalmace.blogspot.com/2022/01/review-heroic-legendarium.html?m=1

Edit: since the “deal of the day” only applies to the pdf version I’ve also manually added a $10 discount to the price of the hardcover version.

17xidtn,"On the Odder Side: An OSR RPG Inspired by Neil Gaiman and ""Into the Odd"""," 

&#x200B;

Hello RPG lovers and fans of the macabre!

I'm thrilled to introduce you to my Kickstarter campaign for ""On the Odder Side"", a dark fantasy tabletop RPG deeply inspired by Neil Gaiman's 'Neverwhere'. Drawing on the framework of Chris McDowall's celebrated ""Into the Odd"", ""On the Odder Side"" employs the ""Mark of the Odd"" system for gameplay that's both accessible and rich in strategic depth. It's an ideal match for both seasoned OSR players and newcomers to the genre.

The game transports players to a surreal, shadowy version of our world, blending the odd and the extraordinary with elements that might feel familiar. It’s a nod to Gaiman's unique storytelling style, where the bizarre becomes the norm.

Since launching on Kickstarter, the response has been phenomenal. We've soared past our initial goals, demonstrating a real hunger for this kind of imaginative and atmospheric play.

As the creator of this project, I am passionate about building more than just a game; I aim to foster a community where fans of horror, fantasy, and role-playing can unite. Whether you're seeking a game with rich, narrative-driven adventures or something that captures the essence of classic D&D with a fresh twist, ""On the Odder Side"" offers something for everyone.

Explore the Kickstarter page for ""On the Odder Side"" and join us on this unique adventure. Your support and enthusiasm are what make this project extraordinary.

Here’s the link to embark on the journey: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pizzagames/on-the-odder-side](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pizzagames/on-the-odder-side)

m2podo,"[knave] first rpg game ever, need some help","Hi all, I want to play first ever rpg session for me (referee) as my friends (players) this week. I have chosen Knave as a system and Tomb of the Serpent Kings as an adventure to play. During my preparation for it I got few questions, that I would like to ask you. I guess some are Knave specific, some are general to osr/rpg genere.

1. Why Quiver exist? I assume that I can keep arrows as any other items in my items slots (and stack them reasonably), so why I need quiver? Does it means that quiver and arrows in it doesn't counts as item in items slots? Can i only have 20 arrows and nothing more in my items slots?
2. How can I recover arrows? I guess in dnd you roll wisdom to collect arrows after fight, it is applicable here to?
3. AFAIK, the only place in ruleset mentioning food is ""after a meal and a full night's rest, PCs regain lost hit points..."", and then shop have table full of different foods and animals. Why should I buy i.e. bacon (10g) instead off travel ration (5g)? I guess i can add some effect to food, but why then basic travel ration exists.
4. Spells could be used only once per day, so for me it makes magic heavy character is useless, cause after each fight this character needs full night rest. Should magic heavy character depends on melee/range weapons most of the fights anyway or I'm missing something?
5. What's the cost of switching weapons/spells? In ruleset you can read that spell book must be held in both hands, but I don't know whats the cost of switching spell books during fight or changing bow for sword
6. There are different traps across whole dungeon, how do I prevent party from examining each square foot of dungeon and rolling for finding traps?
7. I'm used to from computer rpgs that dmg is heavily based on the weapon you have. In Knave all weapons that are listed are available from lvl 1, you can't progress further with your weapon dmg. I guess I'm free to create more powerful weapons, allow upgrading gear talking to blacksmith (adding modifiers etc.), are there some general rules how to make it ""correctly"" (not too strong, not too weak). Or should i rather rely rather on those basic weapons?
8. How to handle light sources in dungeon? I don't want party to go to town every hour to buy more torches, so I guess i need to place some in dungeon too, but if torches are in dungeon, why bother anyway? What happens when all light sources exhaust?
9. Some events outside fight have some aoe effects, i.e. exploding trap, but i thought that outside fight i will allow players to explore dungeon more or less freely, don't track at which exact square is each character. But this way I don't know who is in range of aoe. Should I ask them to place characters at specific places even outside fight?

I have read some other rpg books (old school essentials, whitehack ...), but didn't find answers to this type of questions.  
Thank you for all the answers, if you know any source that will help me with those questions / talk about this kind of problems during your first rpg session, please share it with me :D Thank you all!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x115349d30>,osr,1615468048.0

t0vk9n,"Completely New To TT RPG Players Who Want To Give ""D&D"" A Shot","Hello!

I've got a group of friends who have never played or seen anyone play table top RPGs. Completely fresh to the hobby, only hearing about it from older siblings or other friends. One of them approached me knowing that I've played and DM and asked if I would lead them in the ways of the gaming. I of course said yes. Now my only concern comes in that I don't want to play 5e. They haven't mentioned a system or anything because they truly don't know about this hobby, but for some reason my brain is telling me I should probably start them off with 5e, because that's where I started and where I've started other completely new to TT RPG groups. However it just don't get my motor running like it once did.

I've gotten really into OSR and how the games seem to play and how characters are more grounded than in modern RPGs where they become super heroes. Has anyone had experience running completely new players in an OSR game? How did it go?

I haven't play DCC but I collected a lot of the books and really want to give it a shot. Would anyone suggest not running it for a newbie group? My other system would be OSE.

Reaper’s O5R RPG kickstarter is in its final day. Notes from Reaper:

  
Four Core Classes: Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, Wizard  
Four Core Folk: Human, Proudfoot Halfling, Wood Elf, Hill Dwarf  
Six Ability Scores: Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma  
d20-based Resolution System: The core of DDRPG uses a twenty-sided die. Whenever a character attempts something with interesting success or failure, the d20 is rolled and modifiers added.  
Open Skill System is based on Ability Checks - a character's Background, Folk, and Class define what sorts of Skills a PC is proficient in.  
Renovated Spell System - some spells have been revamped, improving utility and effectiveness; Spell Points allow casters to alter spell effects, increasing damage, number of targets, and degree of effect.  
Dangerous - When Hit Points are exhausted, a creature is likely to die. When Hit Points are reduced below 0, the combatant has till the end of the round to be stabilized or they die. There are no Death Saves in DDRPG.  
Easy to Use - DDRPG is compatible with almost any other RPG product. If you want to add something from a different system, it's easy to fold it into DDRPG's ruleset.   


  
My experience/additional info based on the betas over the last year or two:

  
Much like shadowdark it’s a 5e OSR take in may ways..but I think…seemingly compatible with most 5e material (I don’t feel shadow dark really is)…it’s based more on AD&D and C&C rather than something like BX.  While I don’t think they set out to attempt to fix a lot of the perceived issues some people have with the siege engine and it’s conflicts when dealing with class based skills…I think they do.  
Saves and Skill checks are ability score based checks, either proficient or non-proficient, (add level or 1/4 level) plus ability score bonus.    
Characters have one proficient stat save from their Folk, and one they choose.    
Skill proficiencies are more OSR/open in nature..it’s a combination of the folk, class and background (culture, upbringing and pre-class trade).  The game provides examples of backgrounds to select and their characteristics, but players and DMs could come up with their own.  Based on those descriptions in the book of the type of tasks the players are proficient at, the DM and Players make a game time decision if the task at hand would be proficient for the character.  In practice it’s pretty easy and fast given the examples of the types of tasks each folk/class/background would encompass.  
Spells have been reviewed and rewritten based on input from multiple revisions of TTRPGs and try to produce old school effects while taking some improvements from the modern game.  An example is find familiar…without going into too much detail, caster can share senses with the familiar up to a certain distance, death of a familiar can cause hp loss and another familiar can’t be summoned for one year…makes familiars more companions like they were in previous iterations of D&D rather than disposable tools like in 5e.  
Simplified slot based encumbrance. Movement and distance based on paces so that it works well with either grid or theater of the mind.  Armor with max dex bonus similar to 5e, weapons with some 3e/5e/C&C characteristics like finesse, penetration, versatile..etc.  
Overall the attempt was to take elements from many D&D versions, games like C&C and others and put together a good mix of fast game play at the table with some modern lessons learned.  I suppose it will be up to individual opinion on if it’s the right mix for you..they’ve been play testing it and developing for quite a long time however.  For me I think it will be my go to now if people want to play 5e material or a more modern game with a unified mechanic. I still like C&C but I’ve had too many people voice their dislike of siege engine (Trust me..like many of my other RPGs…I’ll personally still play a lot of C&C).  For years I’ve wanted to merge many of the ideas from 5e with C&C that I like for a game that is more my tastes but I’ve been too lazy to do that…these guys did it for me and they have nice quality traditionally bound and printed books to boot, which would be far better than my printed word doc of house rules.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11534b8f0>,osr,1700334135.0

I've been playing RPGs for more than 15 years now (3.5 and CoC 6e were my first games), and I started diving like a maniac into the OSR and retro-clones and the history of the hobby for the past 5+ years.

I write my own campaigns and adventures that I usually play with the same friends, but since I discovered the OSR, I've been teaching more and more people about the hobby, both in-person and online. Because of this, I've been taking notes of what new players understand and expect from an RPG. I write down notes about what makes sense to them and what doesn't, and I just keep improving the way I approach to new players to ease their experience. I've been a language professor for years, that's what I'm used to.

This mix of teaching the hobby to new players plus learning about the history of the hobby and game design resulted in this game I called ""Crepitant"". It's actually more like a series of system-agnostic guidelines that you can learn to adopt in your own group, but everything came from this idea of trying to ""make sense"" out of the original rules that conceived the hobby many years ago, but also adapt them into something that ""make sense"" for players that are just gamifying a story being told, without being too overwhelming. I didn't want yet another retro-clone, nor a game that keeps teaching the same game mechanics/design choices for ""modern readers"". I wanted to modernize the core itself.

This PDF right here is justa teaser. The final book will be published in 2024, containing guidelines for Players and Game Masters; a Bestiary, and a Grimoire.

If you want to stay up to date, consider following **CREPITANT**’s official [**YouTube Channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl39umVEsog-diVKE1u96xQ) or the author’s [**DriveThruRPG**](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/24027/carlos-castillo-davalos) profile.

But that's it, everyone. Thank you so much for your attention.

*HAPPY NEW YEAR!*

yhmjnd,errant rpg,"I like the concept of having simple mechanics yet a plethora of ""procedures"" as it is called in the book, meaning it is easy to pick up and use, but it covers a wide range of things that may well never come up in play, but should they come, there an out of the box solution for something instead of having to house rule something.

How is that concept to you? Isn't making things up on the spot in the spirit of osr? Part of the reason I entirely skipped anything related to 3.5 is because there were just so many rules, and adnd for that matter now that I remembered it. What is your take on this?

While I'm not too familiar with either of the systems, as I haven't had the opportunity to run them in a game, savage worlds compares to it somewhat. Simple resolution, plenty of modular rules and stuff that cover a wide range of applications and situations. Is errant just osr flavoured swade?

Would you run it instead of a more traditional so to speak osr thing or avoid it? Or blend elements from it into your game?

What is your opinion on it?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11538ac30>,osr,1667155836.0
it4i9s,OSR-Wargaming RPG - Are there any OSRs that focus more on the strategic aspects of play?,"**TL;DR:** How to have a strategic level of play with large armies if your PCs have their own armies?

I've been watching and reading some OSR theories on ""Combat as War, not Sport"", and was thinking how it would be possible to run a more ""wargame"" style of combat with your PCs as commanders of units. After all, how would you assault a keep with tens of thousands of guards with just 4 PCs and some Hirelings? Wouldn't you want to lay siege to it, poison its wells, redirect its rivers, burn their food sources, pillage their lands, and so forth? Aren't things easier if you have an army to do things for you?

Sure, we could handwave all of it and say, ""Your army begins sieging the castle"" and roll some dice - but won't that just be similar to normal D&D with ""roll to spot the trap"" or ""roll to explore the dungeon""?

What do you think? Are there OSRs that handle this kind of strategic level of play? With large armies and maybe miniatures? How would you do it? How could we do it so that the PCs are still the main focus of the campaign?

P.S. I understand we can just simplify it and say ""roll to do this"". But if your players want rules, mechanics, or ideas for it, how would you go about doing it? How can we make it more interactive and ""OSR"" - if the Principia Apocrypha is to be followed with the amount of interaction we need.

**Edit:** To tie it with ""Combat as War"", since you wouldn't balance encounters and you'd assume that the keep they're assaulting has thousands of soldiers - how would you attack the keep then? If 4 PCs can assault that keep, why hasn't anyone done it? Why haven't their enemies done it? What makes your PCs so special that they're the only ones who thought of doing that?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1154578f0>,osr,1600157118.0

Besides more Post-Apocalyptic stories, I've got plans for settings, games, characters, monsters, and lots more random generation stuff... but I'm not quite sure what to tackle first in the TTRPG area.

The core rules are finished, along with a campaign book full of random encounters and a full campaign. The itch link also has a oneshot introduction adventure.

It's a rules light sci-fi based role-playing game based on a streamlined version of the Heroes of Adventure 'engine' (my homebrew fantasy rpg system) and takes its influences from things like Classic Traveller (rpg), Aliens (film) and X-Com (video game).

A quick run-down of the key features of the system:

* Rules light sci-fi rpg (could also be run as a skirmish minis type game)
* d20 vs target number core mechanic
* Skill die system (skills rated from 0, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 and added to your skill check)
* Simple 'traveller' style character creation system with 6 backgrounds
* Resource management aspect
* Equipment slots and token system (things to cut out and stick on your character sheet)
* Mission creation guidance
* Sample Humans, Critters, Droids & Aliens
* A starter mission

14ngagq,"Review of the greatest OSR Brazilian RPG, OLD DRAGON 2."," 

Hail guys. Old Dragon, the biggest OSR RPG in Brazil., funded last year in 48 minutes, and having achieved several goals. 

It was released in its first edition as an attempt by the creators to have the same experience they had before the bunch of combos brought by 3a. Inspired by the Basic Fantasy experience, the authors independently edited and published a book of 150 pages, with four races, four classes and tools to play up to level 20. It was the first OSR RPG in Brazil and had as its main characteristics: unified save roll, separate races and classes, and specializations (explained later) plus 3rd edition number parameters like stat modifiers 17, +4, and ascending armor classes above 30 for the most epic enemies. 

After 10 or 12 years, changing the way RPGs are written and detecting certain things that could be improved over time, the second edition of this beloved RPG from Brazil was announced, with a unique community in the amount of content produced and collaboration between its members. The new edition was successfully funded in less than an hour (48 minutes) in a crowdfunding format, gaining support from 1322 people, in various digital and physical formats, on FC and Late Pledge. 

The Basic Book is provided free of charge in pdf format, in addition to the SRD being free and easy to consult (<https://olddragon.com.br/livros/srd/>), and the physical hardcover book has an affordable price, much more accessible than the original RPG corebooks in the current edition. 

This analysis aims to analyze the characteristics of the basic book (lLB1), free in pdf, and the expanded rules book (LB2). 

The core book (LB1) has rules up to level 10 Corebook 2, Expanded Rules has rules from level 11 to 15, in addition to dominance rules and mass battles.

OLD DRAGON A RETROGOLEM

Old Dragon is not intended to be a retroclone, but an amalgamation of the best options already presented by several editions of the original Rpg up to advanced 2 in search of the best that one has of this experience in a game. So the core of the system follows this d&d like pattern, and that's why I'm going to talk about what it's different from. Starting with its unique and exclusive concept: Specializations.

SPECIALIZATIONS

Specializations are archetypes that represent different hero concepts than the basic four: fighter, rogue, mage, and cleric, but that fit them. Barbarians are fighters, illusionists are wizards, and assassins are thieves. A specialization streamlines the game and makes its application easier. They share with the base class: hit dice, number of spells per day, number of protection rolls, and have a different XP table, presented in the base class table. So you gain time and agility, in addition to having support from the base class for the creation of any specialization. In the core book we have the barbarians and paladins, as specializations of warriors. Scholar and Druid as cleric specializations; illusionist and necromancer as wizard specs and bards and rangers as thief specs. Specializations can be chosen during character creation and while the character is still at first level.

SEPARATE RACE AND CLASS, BUT WITH THAT STRESS FOR THE RACE AS A CLASS

In addition to all these options, specializations give you enough structure and freedom to create your own, and the ones that caught the most attention in this second edition are the specializations that honor races as a class in the BX and Cyclopedia editions. We have the dwarf adventurer, a warrior specialization exclusive to dwarves, halfling adventurer, thief specialization exclusive to halflings, and elf adventurer, wizard specialization exclusive to elves. Each of these specializations represent, in their honor, the most typical and outstanding examples of their class, with powers and abilities that reflect a classic icon of that class. Want race as a class? Use them. And best of all, they do not exclude the use of other specializations. A group can have an elf adventurer, mixed fighter and mage, and an elf warrior, each with their own focus. There are many, good and meaningful character options.

WARRIORS

Warriors have dv d10, with a +1 attack bonus at each level, to a maximum of +15 at level 15, the game's maximum level. In addition, he has the attractive parry abilities, where he is able to sacrifice a shield or weapon to nullify all damage from a successful attack before the damage is rolled. A true hitting machine, but still deadly, like any old school character.

CLERGY

Clerics have seen a huge improvement in how their skills work. Possessor of divine spells, it can replace any previously memorized spell with Cure Wounds, and besides, here's the best version of warding off undead you'll ever see: When performing the turn undead maneuver, the cleric forces the undead to make a morale check. The morale check, like the classic one, is made in 2d6. If the undead fails andthe results fall in equal numbers (1 and 1, 3 and 3, and etc) the undead turns to dust. Goodbye tables. According to one of the creators, this, in addition to speeding up the game, has probabilities strangely coincident with the classic table, being only necessary to adapt the moral value of the living dead, which was done in the bestiary, the third basic book. DV d8.

WIZARDS

Mage is the most misunderstood class in OSR games. A glass cannon that after firing its shot becomes a 1d4 life fret. To remedy this, mages have more starting spells, plus the ability to Read and Detect Spells, making them more useful overall. DV d4.

THIEF ABILITIES

Following the premise of improving what can be improved, and listening to the community, thieves skills have had their tests changed to d6, in addition to the evolution progression of these skills being customizable. The thief takes 2 to each of his abilities, +2 points, and + his Dexterity modifier as starting points. At levels 3, 6 and 10 he gains 2 more points. The maximum level of a thieves skill is 5, and to succeed on a check requires less than or equal. Ranger and bard have different abilities, but with the same mechanical functioning as the thief since they are archetypes that fit under the umbrella of the thief. The DV of thieves and their specializations is d6.

SAVING THROWS

The saving throws have been merged into 3, and a number related to level and class follows. To this base number we add the Wisdom or Dexterity or Constitution modifiers and we have the three saving throws of their respective attributes. To unify roll under tests, saving throws follow this model, and therefore this value increases across levels. All classes start with the base number 5, and a successful check is achieved by rolling a die and getting a value less than or equal to it.

ARMOR CLASS

Armor class is ascendant, and instead of tables and thaco we have the beautiful BA. Unlike some, to succeed in an attack you must have a result greater than your AC. The draw is on the defense.

RACES

The races have a template similar to the advanced second edition, by more classic standards. They all have some benefit on one of the saving throws, in addition to other classic benefits, such as dwarves hitting ogres and the like easier, elves doing more damage with a bow, and halflings with thrown weapons. As humans are the class that have the fewest benefits, they gain an additional 10% of all XP. 

APPEARANCE, FEATURE AND HISTORY

The core book has solid content, not just the basics of character creation, race, class, equipment, combat, and magic. There is a chapter devoted to providing tables to enrich any character, GM and player alike. These options are further enriched with core book 2, which features more customization options, a more detailed background, and an excellent flashback history option, where we discover the character's background during the game, while also filling out some of the character's skills. character.

FUNCTIONAL LOADING SYSTEM

The load system is intended to maintain the need to manage resources, characteristic of the old school, while making it desirable and as simple as possible. The load system assigns a load value to each object that represents its weight and the difficulty of carrying it. Weapons and armor, take up 1, 2 or 3 charge depending on weight/size. Other equipment takes 1 charge per kilo. Coins occupy every 100 pieces, 1 charge. A character who has a backpack adds +5 to his maximum load. A character's maximum encumbrance rating is the greater of Strength and Constitution. Simple and functional, they did it.

INITIATIVE

Test of wisdom or dexterity. Who passed acts before the enemies. Those who did not pass, act later. Ready. =\]

MOVEMENT IN HEXES

The system features a simple version instead of hex distance calculations. Each character has a movement value, usually 9. This value can decrease due to overload. When the system deals with hex movement scale, it considers that a 6km hex costs x movement points. Each character has their movements in points to travel per day. More difficult terrain costs a greater amount of movement points. So, forget about counting distances. You have 9 movement points to spend, and on this table are the movement costs. What do you do?

TEST ADJUSTMENTS

Tired of consulting what the test modifier is, whether +1, +3, +2 depending on each situation? Your problems are over. All tests have unified settings. The adjustments are: easy +2 on rolls, very easy +5, hard -2, very hard -5. An advantage cancels out a disadvantage. This applies to combat, ability checks, and saving throws. Simple guidelines for arbitrating the argument mentation and narrative development of a task that has significant consequences for the game.

MASTER'S SECTION

This section has extensive solid material for GMs to run their games, especially useful for beginners, and excellent content for reviewing their games based on common sense and fun. Here is the clear adage of ""change the rules if it makes your game more fun"". A generator of dungeons and adventures that make you play easily even without preparation.

MAGIC ITEMS

Not just the classic old school items, but also guidelines and tables for generating new and unique items to surprise those players who have already read everything. 

MONSTERS

The core book features the most iconic classic monsters, plus an exclusive and traditional system: the pygmy fungus and its hair, valuable tobacco herb.

DESIGN NOTES

Throughout the book there are explanatory notes on why the rules are the way they are, how to use or change them to achieve another result, or to tailor the game to your group.

APPENDIX

Here's another shining moment from the book. This index, organized alphabetically, references the rules in both books, the core book and the expanded rule book. So you can pick up any of the books for reference and you'll know where to find what you need, even if it's not in that book.

COMPATIBILITY

Old dragon is directly compatible with everything published up to the second advanced edition of the original roleplaying game. Parameters can be converted but the amounts of power are basically the same. Attribute adjustments have a maximum of +3, the attack bonus has a maximum, for players, of +15, if you are a warrior. The armor class of the strongest creatures goes up to 21. You'll need to convert the club or AC by subtracting 20, and warriors here are real warriors, closer to the advanced version of the original rpg game. With that in mind, it's much easier to convert and take that classic adventure to the table with this system. 

CONCLUSION

For some time Old Dragon had ended their releases. A lot was launched and the public clamored for the compendium, a legendary book never released that would give extra rules, the demand for this book lasted for years and years, it was even written and came out as a B-side document to be downloaded around. However, this additional rule took so long that perhaps it lost its importance, since the game already gave you rules to play up to level 20. In the meantime, everyone had already made do with their house rules The decision to remake the system and rewrite everything based on feedback from players updated the way the system was written. We see that it is the same system, but updated and improved, and with the advantage that the advanced rules have already been released together with the basic book, not missing from the consumer at any time. I plan to touch points in these advanced rules in the future. The main virtues of the system are: solidity and accessibility. The old dragon pdf was always free, if you wanted you could buy the physical book. This one, by the way, always very accessible, showing the publisher's commitment to popularize the hobby. The physical quality of this new edition is impeccable: color illustrations for the most important parts, such as the cover, chapter openings, references to races and classes. It is worth noting that the printing house where it was printed is known for the quality of its products, being the only one in Brazil authorized to print the original rpg books in their fifth edition. Old dragon proposes to provide you with an rpg experience already consolidated by decades of playtest, experience that was lost from the 3rd edition and was never recovered. It does this successfully, however, without being a copy and paste of old systems, but rather, the use and affirmation of those things that have worked for so long, but excluding what never worked (robbery in % for example). The best things from that old gaming experience have been preserved. The worst, removed. And everything in the game is modular, you can change the charge, magic, initiative rule without breaking. Its core has been playtested for over ten years, and changes from the latest version have been through 2 years of playtesting with the community. The system has improved, maintained its virtues: solidity and accessibility, and successfully manages to give you the old-school experience, without philosophizing about the natural nature of the dialectical agency of the emergent narrative of the OSR rpg and giving you, instead, fun, exactly as it used to be.

o1l25l,LET'S FUCKING PLAY AN RPG: A micro RPG on one (double-sided) page.,"# Edit: Version 9.8 is up!

It's live! [https://dmmagic.itch.io/lets-fing-play-an-rpg](https://dmmagic.itch.io/lets-fing-play-an-rpg)

Some time ago, I came across **HERE'S SOME FUCKIN' D&D**—a micro RPG that's been floating around the internet for a while. (In fact, [here's a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4066um/heres_some_fuckin_dd/) on Reddit about it from five years ago.) I've run **HSFD&D** tons of times at bars, barbeques, picnics, and camping, and I was such a huge fan that I rebuilt it from the ground up. I posted updates in various subs off and on over the last few years and always got great feedback. But after working on it for so long, I've realized it's not at all the same game anymore. With that said, I bring to you **LET'S FUCKING PLAY AN RPG: An RPG for when you just want to fucking play.**

**LFPARPG** is a beer and pretzels micro RPG that doesn't take itself seriously. It's perfect for bars, barbeques, picnics, camping, or anywhere else you can sit down for an hour and roll some dice. Put a copy of it inside a pencil box with some index cards, golf pencils, and dice and you have an RPG you can take anywhere. My plan is to release the final version on my Itch.io for free, along with some $1 supplements.

~~But before that, I need help! It's been sitting in my head for so long, I would really~~ *~~really~~* ~~appreciate some critical eyes to look over it.~~

**PS:** I get that the swearing isn't everyone's cup of tea. Please note that a clean version is included.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1156634d0>,osr,1623893511.0
17htu0u,GM looking for additional players for an ongoing Shadowdark RPG open table wilderness crawl + megadungeon(s) campaign,"So far the focus has been **Barrowmaze** megadungeon.  This is a true **open table** so one-time drop-ins, potential regulars, and occasional players are equally welcome.

**System: Shadowdark RPG**

**Usual Schedule**: Thursday 8:15PM-11:15PM Atlantic (7:15PM-10:15PM Eastern) and Saturday 10:30AM-1:30PM Atlantic (9:30AM-12:30PM Eastern) on alternating weeks.

**Tools**: Discord, Owlbear Rodeo

**Setting**: 300 years ago a new land was discovered, full of wild forests, jagged mountain ranges, and ancient ruins of long-dead civilizations.  It's coast was settled by nine petty kingdoms that skirmished over the land's rich resources, but the wild interior remained untamed.   80 years ago armies of a previously-unknown hobgoblin empire arrived and conquered.  30 years ago, a civil war in the hobgoblin heartland gave the subjugated peoples a chance to win their freedom and drive the hobgoblins back... but at great cost.  Now, civilized settlements dot the coast and struggle for survival and adventurers are once again drawn to this wild frontier land by the promise of riches and glory to be found in the wilds and ancient ruins of the interior.

w0sl1a,I MADE SOMETHING! Primal Quest is OUT IN PRINT! Weird Stone & Sorcery RPG!,"Primal Quest - Essentials, my latest game and project I will be focusing primarily for a while, has been released in print by Exalted Funeral with a accompanying introductory adventure called The Cave of Our People and a few 3rd Party releases.

This is a game of sword and sorcery in a mythical stone age with dinosaurs, aliens, elder gods, and much more.

The system draws both from the OSR and from games such as FATE, Genesys, Barbarians of Lemuria, Into the Odd, Cortex Prime (and probably more stuff). It still plays very much in the spirit of the famous Quick Primer for Old School Gaming (https://www.lulu.com/shop/matthew-finch/quick-primer-for-old-school-gaming/ebook/product-3159558.html), and fits perfectly into the principles of Principia Apocrypha (https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html). Which means it’s a game that challenges the player and not their character sheet; it is suitable and prone to open world and adventures; it has a core and sturdy system but do not try to have a rule for absolutely every situation imaginable (rulings not rules), and all that stuff we know and love.

The reception has been really good so far! I am excited! There’s already a few supporting projects in development for it, including a solo/GMLess supplement, a character generator supplement with additional options and tools, a set of adventures by a fello Brazilian writer, and some other secret stuff!

In calculating hp, and after considering Constituion bonuses (the fighter has a higher Con bonus), the Knave fighter has 8 hp and the Knave wizard has 10 hp.

Granted this could happen in most d&d character creation systems, but I think it will happen a lot more in Knave because everyone rolls the same d6 for hp. Does anyone else think this is a bit, off?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x115675af0>,osr,1685008162.0

16zp3wv,New DM Whisperer milestone reached (open source tool for authoring and running rpg sessions),"Hello and thank you in advance for reading this.

My name is Max, I'm a DM (OSR being exactly my cop of tea) and I have been developing an open source webapp named DM Whisperer (DMWHisper) for the past few months.

**What does this app do?**

In short, it allows you to create an RPG session from scratch, composed by:

\- rich text content pages, allowing copypasta from Word and similar apps.

\- tables, with several smart features like rolling on multiple tables at once, tables that reference other tables, browsing the entire table instead of rolling upon it..

\- nested levels of menus to give structure to the above content items

&#x200B;

One month ago I posted the last update on development and here I am again.

&#x200B;

What happened during this month in DM Whisperer development land?

&#x200B;

**First off, the authoring section has been greatly expanded.**

\- CKSource kindly donated a CKEditor 5 license and now this is the default content editor.

This means, among other things, that you can copy and paste from Word, HTML sites etc. 

Yes, images and layout included!

\- You can now Cut, Copy and Paste single nodes or entire content subtrees. 

It's now super easy to copy and move content around.

&#x200B;

**The import / export section has been also expanded.**

\- Now you can import and export content as a JSON file instead of relying entirely on the clipboard.

\- You now have five internal slots to save your content so that you can switch on the fly between, say, this week session that's already done but you want to rehearse before the session, and next week session that you're still preparing.

\- It's now also possible to distribute your session together with the app, by using the following URL scheme:

<url of the DM Whisperer webapp>?datafile=<url of the json data file>

(this is useful if you decide to host DM Whisperer on your web space)

&#x200B;

**The content browsing section (the one you use during the session with your players) has been greatly expanded as well.**

\- First off, the rich text now makes it easier to read your content.

Plus, you can put links into your content for, say, launching content such as background music when your party reaches some kind of milestone.

\- You now have persistent bookmarks (five of them)! This way you can switch, with one tap, between a submenu with some handy tables, the next story scenes, NPC sheets etc.

\- You can navigate between content pages at the same level, without getting back to the submenu (much like reading book pages)

&#x200B;

**If you're not a developer, click on this link to run the app in your browser (works best with smartphones and tables, but runs great also on PCs and Macs):**

[https://www.marsiglietti.it/dmwhisper/](https://www.marsiglietti.it/dmwhisper/)

Note: the app is installable (for free) from the above site as a Progressive Web App.

Also note that the app comes with some example content, that's not really useful for your session. You are supposed to provide your own content.

&#x200B;

If you need help creating content, you can contact me here on Reddit. Eager to help!

**Sources for this app are on GitHub**: [https://github.com/maxmars/dmwhisper](https://github.com/maxmars/dmwhisper)

(If you like this open source webapp, please ""star"" it on the GitHub page)

Thank you in advance for your suggestions and for using DM Whisperer!

cu2l1v,Artistic nudes in RPG art?,"If creating an RPG for the OSR crowd, what is the tolerance for artistic nudes?  I ask sincerely, as someone who loves classical sculpture and art.  

If public domain art was used for, say, the Sphinx - and there was a nipple in a non-sexual context - would that be okay?

If so, could someone who is adamantly drawing art in the same style, in the same context, the same subject (example Sphinx), would said nipple be ""offensive""?  Would it suddenly be ""porn"" and therefore not good for general public consumption?

I'm not talking about intending to shock the audience. Just ""I want a classical-style ink drawing like this"" and not wanting the Sphinx, or the Gorgon, or whoever, to have a seashell bikini for no reason.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1156985f0>,osr,1566503271.0

&#x200B;

Plot Summary:

Flex, Ignatious, and Norage get acquainted at the Firebreathing Kittens' commissary and guild hall, while looking at the notice board, where they find a job from Edmas Thomison's Eastinghouse corporation to retrieve a sample at nearby Lake Carashe for a large sum of gold. After the initial hesitation due to bad blood between Thomison and thew Cogbright family, Nulisag reveals that the job is already pre-paid. Seeing an opportunity to double-cross the double-crosser, Ignatious wholeheartedly accepts the mission.

Norage, recognizing the lake to be a quick walk away from the Eight Paths Monastery, offers to navigate while Flex provides a mech for a quick transport option. The intrepid heroes make it to the gates of the Monastery, which have doors blown off hinges and show signs of a struggle, but no sign of life.

After running into the main courtyard and smelling blood, Norage runs to the quarters of Master Malakkus XXIV to make sure he is okay. On the way, the group gets ambushed by a gang of strangely floppy and rabid otters, who nearly take down Norage before being dispatched by the group. In Malakkus' quarters, the gang finds the sign of a struggle and decide to look for Eight Paths monks to get the full story. Slowing their pace after a few run-ins with traps, the gang comes to the main mess hall, where orders urged the monks to find shelter in a panic room.

As the gang follows Norage through the halls again, they come across a puzzle trap that requires using four of the Eight Paths to open it. Norage forgets which color aligns to which element and performs meditative combat with his hulking forge hammer as Ignatious and Flex quickly solve the puzzle, opening the doors to reveal Malakkus and the monks.

The groups exchange pleasantries as Malakkus mentions that there may be weapons testing going on that is not of the monks' creation. After making sure the monastery and its inhabitants are safe, the gang heads to Lake Carashae. The lake itself seems normal, however the gang soon finds out that the crystal-clear water is not a place they want to be in. As the party deliberates on what exactly Thomison wanted as ""a sample"", an alligator ascends and snatches Flex from shore.

The party fight it out with the alligator, who very nearly kills Flex. Luckily, Flex's Momma intervenes via dream sequence and returns vitality to Flex, who is able to see the combat through at the cost of a foot and ankle. The party decides that the water will be circulated into the larger water system and diluted out in a few days' time, and that Thomison should absolutely not have his hands on the strange water. The gang fills samples with normal well water and some other choice bodily fluids as a crass declaration against the Eastinghouse company.

Later on, Thomison consults with a mysterious being named Azmodeth that manifests as the fire in the hearth. Seemingly none the wiser about the quality of the samples, he ruminates on them with Azmodeth, who mentions that ""The Charming Chabin"" has been used, and the end of their contract may come sooner rather than later.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11569af90>,osr,1684930689.0

f4aan0,Andrzej Sapkowski's RPG from 1990,"A little bit of old-school RPG trivia hailing from Poland, and regarding our no.1 fantasy writer, father of the Witcher, Andrzej Sapkowski.  


Even in Poland only few people know that in 1990, around the publication of the short stories titled simply ""The Witcher"" Sapkowski wrote first an article, and then a full fledged RPG game system named ""*Oko Yrrhedesa*"" (**The Eye of Yrrhedes**).

&#x200B;

[1999 book format edition by MAG](https://preview.redd.it/wpqpz2kdn3h41.jpg?width=2208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1d65b51a4043364e7724ce91d13d3924242d51c)

# Publication history

1990 - Monthly SF magazine ""**Fenix**"" in 1990, as a few pages consisting of basic rules and a play example.  
1994 - Monthly RPG magazine ""*Magia i Miecz*"" (**Magic & Sword**), as an expanded version of the rules from Fenix, including new Game Master's Sourcebook and a chapter on magic and spells.  
1995 - standalone, in small format (A5), titled simply ""***Oko Yrrhedesa***"". It included expanded rules, written by other people, and two adventures: a dungeon crawl about the titular ""Eye of Yrrhedes"" and a kind of ""river-crawl"" campaign ""*Yarra - Rzeka Śmierci*"" (Yarra - the River of Death) written by Sapkowski himself. It was illustrated by a popular fantasy illustrator **Jarosław Musiał**.  
1999 - second printing of ""*Oko Yrrhedesa*"", this time in even smaller book format \[all pictures in this article come from this book\].

[Chapter 1: For Those, Who for the First Time...](https://preview.redd.it/6d0ouftmn3h41.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca0b5400d0b651bc52a0671b4be08a3dc601cfb1)

# Historical Context

When Sapkowski was publishing ""the Eye"" in Fenix, Poland was still recovering from communism. American pop culture was exploding among young people. SF & Fantasy magazines, while still present during earlier years, were booming; people wanted to read and write sword & sorcery adventure stories. Suddenly fantasy tabletop games, either imported (legally or not) or designed by eager polish fans were available for everyone.  


In late 80's Polish board game company ""*Sfera*"" (Sphere, meaning also a ""plane of existence"" in polish) obtained rights to 2nd edition of Talisman game from Games Workshop. It's worth mentioning, that the Polish edition was the only one in the world, that had original art - everything: the boards, cards, characters had new (and many consider - better than original) illustrations. Sfera even made their own expansion for the game: the Cave. While the story of polish editions of Talisman is an interesting history in it;s own rights, suffice to say - Poland was extremely hungry for fantasy games.  


Still, we had no polish RPG as of yet, not mentioning polish editions of D&D or any other game.  


In this void, Sapkowski, who was slowly rising as the most famous fantasy writer in Poland at the time, must have had contact with D&D around late 1980's. And decided to introduce the basic idea to the readers of ""Fenix"".

&#x200B;

[Chapter 3: Game Master's Sourcebook](https://preview.redd.it/xtwpn9tkn3h41.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b60057eb03ec7fef11bcdd769d3c1624e1bd512f)

# The Game Itself

The Eye of Yrrhedes is a very, extremely simple game. Sapkowski focuses mostly on the method of the game, the playstyle more then rules (an approach I'd eagerly call OSR-like). In long, often fictionalized paragraphs he tries to explain the idea of a ""game of imagination"" to Polish reader for the first time in history.  Let me try to translate for you one such passage from the very first page of the book:  


>Thursday, half past five in the evening. ""Teleexpress"" just ended in the TV. Outside a tram rumbles by, two floors below a neighbour is drilling holes. You and three of your friends sit around a table...  
>  
>Smoke, smoke from a huge fireplace stings the eyes. The light is dim, scarcely lit by oil lamps. Ale is frothing inside clay mugs. A murmur of voices around, the inn is full. A group of dwarven miners sit around the next table, playing dice after a hard day's work at the silver mine. Warmth. Weariness.  
>  
>""Don't sleep, Corwin"" says Arebell, slamming against the table with the pommel of her dagger. She means you.  
>  
>""I'm not sleeping"" you answer. ""I was lost in though"". Don't get lost in thought.  


So, yeah, most of the time, Sapkowski again and again tries to make sure everyone understands the basic feature of a roleplaying game. He mentiones many times that the game is supposed to ""simulate reality"", and that the Game Master is tasked with making the game fair.

Beyond the theory the game mechanics are pretty simple and uses only d6 (in 1990's it wasn't easy to get any other dice in Poland).

It's worth mentioning that Sapkowski, being a writer and storyteller didn't do a great job building the game or making it approachable. Even the character creation process is fictionalized while breaking the fourth wall at the same time, which makes the rules somewhat lost in narrative.  


There is a several pages long gameplay example and this makes the game shine. Characters (and their players) are interesting and have cool, creative ideas and funny one-liners. That's Sapkowski for you.  


The whole game has no setting. It's about ""fantasy heroes in fantasy world"". The book is written with the dungeon crawling in mind, and up to this day is the only Polish RPG written with such mindset.

# Effect

Many Polish grognards started their adventure with RPG with ""The Eye of Yrrhedes"". But the ""success"" of the game was short, for soon another fantasy RPG game, created by other people debuted: the highly convoluted fantasy moloch of game inspired by AD&D named ""*Kryształy Czasu*"" (Crystal of Time). It had more rules (many, many, many more, to the point of being nearly unplayable) and it quickly became no.1 in Poland for next few years.  


Sapkowski never mentioned ""the Eye"" later on, never thinking about updating it, probably thinking that the game has ""done it's job"" introducing the idea of RPG to Polish fans. ""Oko Yrrhedesa"" remains a short and quite forgotten little gem of the history of Polish RPG.  


And if someone would ask me about any Polish OSR material, I'd point at ""Oko Yrrhedesa"", and nothing else.

lverxe,Would You Like to See Your Creations in a tabletop RPG? *Self-Promotional Stuff Inside*,"I’m Joe and this last October myself and two others were lucky enough to have our first tabletop RPG project, Acheron, funded on Kickstarter. One of our community members put forward the idea of a creature creation competition. So we wanted to open up our community to others and give everyone an opportunity to take their favorite self-made creature and add it to our book with some sweet illustrations too. Also if you have any friends who would be interested please share! This is open to any and all and we really just want to get people excited in general about the awesome things they’ve created. This is open to any/all.

**A bit about Acheron:**

Acheron is a dystopian world with technology similar to the 1930s-1940s. A singular Government tries to keep a hold over its people while Anarchist sentiment rises, deadly beasts roam the countryside, and powerful factions vie for control.

It is a world where magic is real, but denied or unknown to most. Government conspiracies are rampant though only real half the time. Powerful Mancers walk the streets, able to destroy city blocks with a blink, but most just want a simple life. Unions form and are crushed under the heavy boot of corporate interests. Factions dance around each other looking for a kill. However, through all of this, technology and civilization are booming. The curtain over history put in place by the Government since it’s rise has been drawn back. Many people on the brink of losing their identities are now free to learn who they are and where they come from. Yet the world braces for the Government's true plans to come to light, because this must just be another conspiracy. Right?

Acheron is heavily inspired by the works of George Orwell, the Dishonored and Thief franchises, the SCP foundation, Eldritch horror, and old school monster/scifi flicks.

**Competition:**

We are happy to announce that, through a generous donation from The Monster and Anomaly Preservation Society, we will be including several fan documented creatures in our Acheron core rule book (CRB) bestiary section. If you have seen, heard, or better yet fully analyzed a creature you wish to be documented please submit a full report by reviewing the information and following the steps below. We look forward to reading your submission!

* Go to [https://www.darkworldstudios.net/](https://www.darkworldstudios.net/)
* Click on either the “Creature Creation Competition Info” button on the main page or “Download Beta” button in the upper right.
* Sign up for our newsletter
* An Acheron Beta PDF with useful information and full rules document will be emailed to you! (Check your spam/promotions folder, sometimes these emails get lost).

If you have any questions please email us at [info@darkworldstudios.net](mailto:info@darkworldstudios.net)

We can’t wait to see what everyone comes up with! Happy documenting and we look forward to reading your full report.

EDIT: We made a mistake. We've updated our competition to include payment for the finalists and clarify the fact that we won't own anything that's not selected/paid for. Hopefully there are some people that will find this competition fun, since that's what it was meant to be from the start.

1jcnc7i,In defense of Keep on The Borderlands (and also a defense of Humanoid enemies),"I came across a thread a few weeks ago and I’ve been ruminating on my thoughts for a while. The thread is locked so I couldn’t reply right then and there and I’m not sure where I even saw it or who this response is to but oh well, here I am.

 The main gist was “why run keep on the borderlands? It’s boring, none of the enemies are interesting and they don’t even name any of the NPC’s.” Other people replied but no answer was sufficient (in my or the OP’s opinion.) 
I believe that KOTB is the perfect module to get someone to DM. That was the main purpose in the first place. The area is quite large with a lot of interesting little areas and room for the DM to flex their creativity. It leaves quite a bit open to slot into any campaign.

Aside from the faction play that really makes the caves of chaos so fun, having humanoids be the first real enemies allows both the players and the DM to understand the motives, tactics and mindset of what you are fighting. Big pig face dude and sneaky little boys are much easier for someone new to both TTRPGs and fantasy as a whole to understand than say, a gibbering mouther or xorn. 

We’ve had decades upon decades of iterations on ttrpgs, lots of new creations and creativity on the scene and we are in an absolute deluge of new options. Why complain about the origins of the hobby?That’s where most of this started for a metric butt ton of people. Of course it’s tropey. It created the tropes! 

I guess I’m going to end this with a question. Other than time constraints, why does it seem like there are a lot of people who don’t understand that this is a game of imagination? Why are some people seemingly allergic to deviating from the books and making it their own? (And just to add some inflammatory statements, this question also goes for the Hispanic coded Orcs in the 5e art. If you don’t like it, don’t add it. You aren’t beholden to the creator’s vision because once the book is yours, it’s your book. You’re the creator now.)

EDIT: I’m not sure if it was even in this sub. It may have been in r/rpg. All I know is that it popped into my feed and I don’t have the knowledge or resources to find it again. But yes, there are people who don’t like kotb.

SECOND EDIT: sorry about the lack of paragraphs. I’m new to this and still trying to figure out how to post on mobile :)",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1170603b0>,osr,1742137222.0

f0psdx,How Do You Prevent Mage Hand From Ruining Every Challenge? (cross-posted from r/rpg),"I sent my D&D 5e characters through a brilliant OSR dungeon last night (Tower of the Stargazer), and discovered that a first-level spellcaster can utterly destroy almost any challenge that requires the player to risk touching anything at all. (See also: Aerial Servant.) Faced with poisoned door knockers, and keys stuck in locks, and mysterious switches and all the rest, he wizard just kept doing Mage Hand, Mage Hand, Mage Hand, Mage Hand, while standing 30 feet away from anything that might poison, trap, or otherwise damage or inconvenience him. It's not just that it really damaged the dungeon experience, but it made for a tedious game experience because the one tool just kept coming out to solve every problem, and no one else had anything better they could do.

I would dearly love to simply ban the spell (pretty easy, if I can convince my players to switch to Five Torches Deep) or change to a roll-to-succeed system. But I thought I'd ask anyone with 5e experience what they've done within the system to curb this ridiculously non-magical (because reliably tedious) ability.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x117061970>,osr,1581156836.0

Central mechanical conceit was that the PCs autofail any attempted dangerous action unless they created an in-world advantage or could argue convincingly for why they already had an advantage. So basically the OSR principle that combat is uber-deadly and requires clever player engagement to win was hard-coded into the rules.

**Plot Summary:**

Kassie, Horatio, and Dash keep watch in the guild hall when a minotaur enters and leads them to a black carriage for a job offer to steal from the Safiosi family mafia.

The party arrives at the Safiosi casino where they sneak in through the kitchen, make a plan to get past the guards and make it to the vault. Dash takes the form of the Head Chef to get in. Kassie meets up with Kaloom Bimbo, who is a ""changed man"". Horatio helps the party charm past the guards and make it to the high stakes, high rewards area. Their disguises work, allowing them to meet up with Cameron Boneire and get him to help them get into the monitor room. Horatio made ""mixed drinks"" that allowed Cameron to win his game of cards, and receive the ""seedling"" as his prize. The monitor room held a puzzle that they passed through to enter the vault. Inside was gold, and the thing they had been sent to steal... the Golden Goose. After successfully escaping the casino with the Goose and a nurse, the party was paid for their troubles and went back to the guild.

Kassie started a nature reserve for the goose, Dash had his memory wiped and now believes his name to be ""Squash"", and Horatio revealed at the end that they were working with the Montaleoni family and was actually in disguise, secretly a lizard-type being.

av2qtf,RPG scenes with OSR-quality and OSR's stylistic cousins,"While woefully inexperienced in tabletop gaming, I've recently become engrossed in DnD content on a literary level and have gravitated towards the OSR scene. In comparison to the official DnD and DnD-adjacent material I've exposed myself to, the content that comes from the OSR scene tends to resonate with me on a creative level. Particularly the works by Patrick Stuart (VotE, MoftBM, Deep Carbon Observatory, and the False Machine blog in general), Patrick Wetmore (Anomalous Subsurface Environment), Chris Kutalik (Fever-Dreaming Malinko), Gus L (Dungeon of Signs blog and content) Luka Rejec (UVG, his blog and art in general), Emmy Allen (GoY and the Stygian Library), David McGrogan (Yoon-Suin), and a half a dozen of the more left-field DCC modules. I find these works to be thought-provoking, self-aware, aesthetically coherent, introspective, wildly creative, and in my opinion transcends the idea of genre. With that said, I find OSR's game-theory, adherence to the Dying Earth genre, and the punk-Lovecraftian try-hard ""edginess"" of brands like LotFP to be some of the least interesting aspects of the scene.

&#x200B;

While absolutely thrilled to have been moored in the OSR asylum with the rest of you, I am looking for an escape to do a little tourism within other tabletop scenes of a similar caliber in terms of creativity. Any suggestions?

&#x200B;

Perhaps I should mention some dead-ends and disappointments - nearly all official + popular 3rd party content for 5e has let me down. Anything that approaches Tolkien/George R.R. Martin pastiche or fanship pandering really grates me. Most of the great works I've encountered outside the OSR scene tend to be in the realm of science fiction (Gamma World content, Paranoia, GURPS stuff), but I am hoping there are some vibrant/alternative fantasy scenes out there as well.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1170ae5d0>,osr,1551205758.0

14ngia7,"Review of the Old Dragon 2, the second edition of the first and greatest osr brazilian rpg."," 

Hail guys. Old Dragon, the biggest OSR RPG in Brazil., funded last year in 48 minutes, and having achieved several goals. 

It was released in its first edition as an attempt by the creators to have the same experience they had before the bunch of combos brought by 3a. Inspired by the Basic Fantasy experience, the authors independently edited and published a book of 150 pages, with four races, four classes and tools to play up to level 20. It was the first OSR RPG in Brazil and had as its main characteristics: unified save roll, separate races and classes, and specializations (explained later) plus 3rd edition number parameters like stat modifiers 17, +4, and ascending armor classes above 30 for the most epic enemies. 

After 10 or 12 years, changing the way RPGs are written and detecting certain things that could be improved over time, the second edition of this beloved RPG from Brazil was announced, with a unique community in the amount of content produced and collaboration between its members. The new edition was successfully funded in less than an hour (48 minutes) in a crowdfunding format, gaining support from 1322 people, in various digital and physical formats, on FC and Late Pledge. 

The Basic Book is provided free of charge in pdf format, in addition to the SRD being free and easy to consult (<https://olddragon.com.br/livros/srd/>), and the physical hardcover book has an affordable price, much more accessible than the original RPG corebooks in the current edition. 

This analysis aims to analyze the characteristics of the basic book (lLB1), free in pdf, and the expanded rules book (LB2). 

The core book (LB1) has rules up to level 10 Corebook 2, Expanded Rules has rules from level 11 to 15, in addition to dominance rules and mass battles.

OLD DRAGON A RETROGOLEM

Old Dragon is not intended to be a retroclone, but an amalgamation of the best options already presented by several editions of the original Rpg up to advanced 2 in search of the best that one has of this experience in a game. So the core of the system follows this d&d like pattern, and that's why I'm going to talk about what it's different from. Starting with its unique and exclusive concept: Specializations.

SPECIALIZATIONS

Specializations are archetypes that represent different hero concepts than the basic four: fighter, rogue, mage, and cleric, but that fit them. Barbarians are fighters, illusionists are wizards, and assassins are thieves. A specialization streamlines the game and makes its application easier. They share with the base class: hit dice, number of spells per day, number of protection rolls, and have a different XP table, presented in the base class table. So you gain time and agility, in addition to having support from the base class for the creation of any specialization. In the core book we have the barbarians and paladins, as specializations of warriors. Scholar and Druid as cleric specializations; illusionist and necromancer as wizard specs and bards and rangers as thief specs. Specializations can be chosen during character creation and while the character is still at first level.

SEPARATE RACE AND CLASS, BUT WITH THAT STRESS FOR THE RACE AS A CLASS

In addition to all these options, specializations give you enough structure and freedom to create your own, and the ones that caught the most attention in this second edition are the specializations that honor races as a class in the BX and Cyclopedia editions. We have the dwarf adventurer, a warrior specialization exclusive to dwarves, halfling adventurer, thief specialization exclusive to halflings, and elf adventurer, wizard specialization exclusive to elves. Each of these specializations represent, in their honor, the most typical and outstanding examples of their class, with powers and abilities that reflect a classic icon of that class. Want race as a class? Use them. And best of all, they do not exclude the use of other specializations. A group can have an elf adventurer, mixed fighter and mage, and an elf warrior, each with their own focus. There are many, good and meaningful character options.

WARRIORS

Warriors have dv d10, with a +1 attack bonus at each level, to a maximum of +15 at level 15, the game's maximum level. In addition, he has the attractive parry abilities, where he is able to sacrifice a shield or weapon to nullify all damage from a successful attack before the damage is rolled. A true hitting machine, but still deadly, like any old school character.

CLERGY

Clerics have seen a huge improvement in how their skills work. Possessor of divine spells, it can replace any previously memorized spell with Cure Wounds, and besides, here's the best version of warding off undead you'll ever see: When performing the turn undead maneuver, the cleric forces the undead to make a morale check. The morale check, like the classic one, is made in 2d6. If the undead fails andthe results fall in equal numbers (1 and 1, 3 and 3, and etc) the undead turns to dust. Goodbye tables. According to one of the creators, this, in addition to speeding up the game, has probabilities strangely coincident with the classic table, being only necessary to adapt the moral value of the living dead, which was done in the bestiary, the third basic book. DV d8.

WIZARDS

Mage is the most misunderstood class in OSR games. A glass cannon that after firing its shot becomes a 1d4 life fret. To remedy this, mages have more starting spells, plus the ability to Read and Detect Spells, making them more useful overall. DV d4.

THIEF ABILITIES

Following the premise of improving what can be improved, and listening to the community, thieves skills have had their tests changed to d6, in addition to the evolution progression of these skills being customizable. The thief takes 2 to each of his abilities, +2 points, and + his Dexterity modifier as starting points. At levels 3, 6 and 10 he gains 2 more points. The maximum level of a thieves skill is 5, and to succeed on a check requires less than or equal. Ranger and bard have different abilities, but with the same mechanical functioning as the thief since they are archetypes that fit under the umbrella of the thief. The DV of thieves and their specializations is d6.

SAVING THROWS

The saving throws have been merged into 3, and a number related to level and class follows. To this base number we add the Wisdom or Dexterity or Constitution modifiers and we have the three saving throws of their respective attributes. To unify roll under tests, saving throws follow this model, and therefore this value increases across levels. All classes start with the base number 5, and a successful check is achieved by rolling a die and getting a value less than or equal to it.

ARMOR CLASS

Armor class is ascendant, and instead of tables and thaco we have the beautiful BA. Unlike some, to succeed in an attack you must have a result greater than your AC. The draw is on the defense.

RACES

The races have a template similar to the advanced second edition, by more classic standards. They all have some benefit on one of the saving throws, in addition to other classic benefits, such as dwarves hitting ogres and the like easier, elves doing more damage with a bow, and halflings with thrown weapons. As humans are the class that have the fewest benefits, they gain an additional 10% of all XP. 

APPEARANCE, FEATURE AND HISTORY

The core book has solid content, not just the basics of character creation, race, class, equipment, combat, and magic. There is a chapter devoted to providing tables to enrich any character, GM and player alike. These options are further enriched with core book 2, which features more customization options, a more detailed background, and an excellent flashback history option, where we discover the character's background during the game, while also filling out some of the character's skills. character.

FUNCTIONAL LOADING SYSTEM

The load system is intended to maintain the need to manage resources, characteristic of the old school, while making it desirable and as simple as possible. The load system assigns a load value to each object that represents its weight and the difficulty of carrying it. Weapons and armor, take up 1, 2 or 3 charge depending on weight/size. Other equipment takes 1 charge per kilo. Coins occupy every 100 pieces, 1 charge. A character who has a backpack adds +5 to his maximum load. A character's maximum encumbrance rating is the greater of Strength and Constitution. Simple and functional, they did it.

INITIATIVE

Test of wisdom or dexterity. Who passed acts before the enemies. Those who did not pass, act later. Ready. =\]

MOVEMENT IN HEXES

The system features a simple version instead of hex distance calculations. Each character has a movement value, usually 9. This value can decrease due to overload. When the system deals with hex movement scale, it considers that a 6km hex costs x movement points. Each character has their movements in points to travel per day. More difficult terrain costs a greater amount of movement points. So, forget about counting distances. You have 9 movement points to spend, and on this table are the movement costs. What do you do?

TEST ADJUSTMENTS

Tired of consulting what the test modifier is, whether +1, +3, +2 depending on each situation? Your problems are over. All tests have unified settings. The adjustments are: easy +2 on rolls, very easy +5, hard -2, very hard -5. An advantage cancels out a disadvantage. This applies to combat, ability checks, and saving throws. Simple guidelines for arbitrating the argument mentation and narrative development of a task that has significant consequences for the game.

MASTER'S SECTION

This section has extensive solid material for GMs to run their games, especially useful for beginners, and excellent content for reviewing their games based on common sense and fun. Here is the clear adage of ""change the rules if it makes your game more fun"". A generator of dungeons and adventures that make you play easily even without preparation.

MAGIC ITEMS

Not just the classic old school items, but also guidelines and tables for generating new and unique items to surprise those players who have already read everything. 

MONSTERS

The core book features the most iconic classic monsters, plus an exclusive and traditional system: the pygmy fungus and its hair, valuable tobacco herb.

DESIGN NOTES

Throughout the book there are explanatory notes on why the rules are the way they are, how to use or change them to achieve another result, or to tailor the game to your group.

APPENDIX

Here's another shining moment from the book. This index, organized alphabetically, references the rules in both books, the core book and the expanded rule book. So you can pick up any of the books for reference and you'll know where to find what you need, even if it's not in that book.

COMPATIBILITY

Old dragon is directly compatible with everything published up to the second advanced edition of the original roleplaying game. Parameters can be converted but the amounts of power are basically the same. Attribute adjustments have a maximum of +3, the attack bonus has a maximum, for players, of +15, if you are a warrior. The armor class of the strongest creatures goes up to 21. You'll need to convert the club or AC by subtracting 20, and warriors here are real warriors, closer to the advanced version of the original rpg game. With that in mind, it's much easier to convert and take that classic adventure to the table with this system. 

CONCLUSION

For some time Old Dragon had ended their releases. A lot was launched and the public clamored for the compendium, a legendary book never released that would give extra rules, the demand for this book lasted for years and years, it was even written and came out as a B-side document to be downloaded around. However, this additional rule took so long that perhaps it lost its importance, since the game already gave you rules to play up to level 20. In the meantime, everyone had already made do with their house rules The decision to remake the system and rewrite everything based on feedback from players updated the way the system was written. We see that it is the same system, but updated and improved, and with the advantage that the advanced rules have already been released together with the basic book, not missing from the consumer at any time. I plan to touch points in these advanced rules in the future. The main virtues of the system are: solidity and accessibility. The old dragon pdf was always free, if you wanted you could buy the physical book. This one, by the way, always very accessible, showing the publisher's commitment to popularize the hobby. The physical quality of this new edition is impeccable: color illustrations for the most important parts, such as the cover, chapter openings, references to races and classes. It is worth noting that the printing house where it was printed is known for the quality of its products, being the only one in Brazil authorized to print the original rpg books in their fifth edition. Old dragon proposes to provide you with an rpg experience already consolidated by decades of playtest, experience that was lost from the 3rd edition and was never recovered. It does this successfully, however, without being a copy and paste of old systems, but rather, the use and affirmation of those things that have worked for so long, but excluding what never worked (robbery in % for example). The best things from that old gaming experience have been preserved. The worst, removed. And everything in the game is modular, you can change the charge, magic, initiative rule without breaking. Its core has been playtested for over ten years, and changes from the latest version have been through 2 years of playtesting with the community. The system has improved, maintained its virtues: solidity and accessibility, and successfully manages to give you the old-school experience, without philosophizing about the natural nature of the dialectical agency of the emergent narrative of the OSR rpg and giving you, instead, fun, exactly as it used to be.

1h21gf7,Ancient Mesopotamia in OSR,"So, I’m a NELC (Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations) student, and for a final project in one class the professor floated the idea of making an RPG module based on Ancient Mesopotamia. I’ve been contemplating the idea of fleshing out the project into a full module and setting book for an OSR-rules game, as I’ve been playtesting my project document with friends and having a ball, and thought it would be fun to get some feedback from the OSR community.

Are any of you interested in the idea of an OSR game based in third millennium Ancient Mesopotamia?

As a player, what would you want to see in a campaign like this? Is there anything you know about the setting—or want to learn more about—that you think you’d enjoy seeing in a campaign?

What sort of information would you want as a GM to bring Ancient Mesopotamia to life?

—

My own research focus is on deities and mythology so those feature prominently in the campaign. Yesterday I ran an adventure loosely based on Gilgameš’s encounter with the legendary forest guardian Humbaba, and the players ended up spending six hours exploring Humbaba’s curse-protected forest and collecting items to help them with their final confrontation with him.

I’m also a really big fan of linguistics and can’t help myself but to include a lot of Sumerian in my project. One feature my friends/players seemed to really enjoy is the ability to construct their own ancient Sumerian names - most of these names are theophoric (e.g., people are named after a deity, usually in a short sentence like “Enki provides”) so I was able to give players a list of name formulas with translations to plug a god’s name into and make a wholly unique name for their character. Outside of naming schemes, it’s actually kind of neat from an academic perspective how fast they picked up Sumerian words and phrases! I think the language additions add a lot of flavor to the campaign. 😊

As a DM and as a player, I really love the OSR philosophy of encouraging lateral thinking and rewarding creative problem-solving. Historical settings are fun to explore with that mindset, as many mythological beings can be quite dangerous but don’t necessarily have malevolent intentions. OSR in general feels like the perfect rules system to explore a setting like this. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1171004d0>,osr,1732815923.0

m1yx6n,"New to OSR but not to RPG, could use some pointers.","Hi Folks,

I've been playing RPGs since my young years and always loved it. My first edition D&D is one of my most cherished treasures. Recently, I've been trying to get back to having fun with RPGs — for I think many systems became overcomplex with time — and came around to finding Troika! and Electric Bastionland. From videos regarding those two products, I've learned that OSR exists.

I noticed that I lack the jargon to understand some of the topics here, and would love if someone could give me some links to read more about. As an example, I had to go search what a pointcrawl is just to realise that I've used that decades ago without naming. My interest is approaching OSR not only from the point-of-view of playing it but also from a game design perspective. So, I'd really appreciate any cool links, posts, books, whatever people could send my way. This is not me asking you to google stuff for me, it is mostly a request that if you have written about OSR yourself or have a favourite resource you always turn to, that I'd like to know more about it.

Thanks in advance for all the help, I suspect that I'm going to like it here.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x117100fb0>,osr,1615387174.0
