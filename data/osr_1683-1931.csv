Not that there ever were a lot, but as of now, any Twitter (""X"") links are banned here on /r/osr. This counts both for posts and comments. I said originally not to call anyone a Nazi unless they literally had Swastika tattoos, but doing a Nazi salute, twice, in public, then trying to convince people to doubt the evidence of their own senses, is at least the equivalent of that.

This is not censorship. This is editorial control. If you want to create your own subreddit, maybe /r/gaslighting (does that already exist?) or /r/nazisarentreallynazis, you are free to do so, and I won't/can't stand in your way.

If you complain that /r/osr has gone ""woke"", or ever use that term in a non-ironic way, I feel sorry for you. It must be exhausting trying to find immigrants, or people with different skin tones, or folks with alternate sexual identities, to blame the consequences of your own poor life decisions on. And trying to defend it as a ""Roman salute"" or whatnot is just sad.

Penalty for posting a Twitter/X link is an instant ban. We'll have to think about for how long, but I'm thinking at least a week. Penalty for trying to subvert by posting an image of such a post or some other circuitous trick will result in a permanent ban.

This was my first experience joining an OSR table so I figured I’d ask if this is common or not. Especially since there was a recent controversy with Questing Beast accepting a sponsorship from an alt-right publisher, I wonder how pervasive of an issue this is.

Edit: To clarify, they self identified as such. They weren’t just to the right of me. They didn’t just hold some racial prejudices and biases, they didn’t just support candidates I didn’t support.

1jezkmd,My players won't stop collecting teeth,"In our Mausritter campaign, I'd created a wizard's tower inhabited by a necromancer obsessed with teeth. He went by The Dentomancer. The Dentomancer made an offhand comment about bring willing to buy teeth off of them, and wasn't really interested in anything besides teeth. It was a hook for a sidequest, nothing more really. 

** I was a fool. **

What I thought was just a fun detail became a goal for one of my players. In his mind, teeth = gold = xp. Teeth have become a complex mechanic with numerous details and caveats. Each time he kills a creature he wants to know the monetary value of their teeth, spends time taking the teeth out of corpses, and asking if any creatures have unique teeth. 

This idea had spread to the rest of my players. They will often choose to engage in combat based solely off of tooth quantity and quality. I've had to Google the number of teeth for real life creatures pretty consistently, and there are now special teeth encumbrance rules. Each new type of tooth results in a new ruling. I'm a big believer in ""rulings not rules"" but they are pushing that philosophy to its limit. It has been six months of consistently tooth-based gameplay. 

The thing is the players have yet to return to the Dentomancer to cash in their teeth. I don't know what will happen when they do. It's not really that big a deal but I wish I had a real solution for this. What should I do?



TL;DR: My Mausritter players have become obsessed with collecting teeth for money, to the point it has become a significant mechanic. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ba4b20c0>,osr,1742397906.0

1evkr02,Discovering OSR ruined other RPG playstyles for me,"I have a background of about 7 years DMing 5e, but also World of Darkness games, Powered by the Apocalypse-like games etc. As a GM, I've basically struggled from the start, and often my struggles relate to adventure design, specifically making an interesting plot and designing a line through the adventure while leaving enough space and tools to play with to allow for player freedom. My plots never felt interesting, getting players to follow them was a pain (""my character is not interested in that"") and getting ""off the rails"" has always been scary for me, not because I'm afraid of improvising, but because once there's rails, that becomes constraining for that improvisation. And the fear of characters dying, both from players because they are very attached, and from me as it can derail the adventure. 

Discovering the OSR, it just feels more right. No grand plot but an interesting world to explore, from which a story evolves. Players being challenged themselves to be genuinely creative and resourceful and death isn't a nuisance that threatens the end the campaign, it's part of the design. A more player-driven outlook, so no more needing to convince players or characters to go on an adventure.  Admittedly these aspects might not be exclusive to OSR but the point stands. 

Knowing that this way of playing exists, makes it even more draining to prep for other games, and playing in such games can be frustrating. Knowing death isn't really on the table because nobody wants the campaign to end, just suddenly makes everything feel pointless? I don't want to meta game but when the GM clearly prepared a certain plot or adventure line, I can't help but be aware of that fact and have it influence my actions. I can't help but feel like, despite there being freedom within the boundaries of the adventure, there's still a fairly clear limit to freedom, and there's a rebellious side in me that finds that knowledge frustrating, like I'm forced to dance to someone elses tune. 

All of this frankly makes me feel a little alienated from the community at large, because this way of playing is massively popular (mostly due to 5e's success). All my friends play that way and like it, but as I've gotten frustrated with the playstyle, I feel less enjoyment playing or running those games. I wish I could fully share their enjoyment as I once did, because in the end that's the most valuable thing this hobby has given me.

1f3scds,"B/X is so intuitive, I don't have to really ""prep"" anymore session to session.  ","To be clear, it was a lot of work before the game started.  I run Jacob Fleming's OSE modules with two groups on roll20, and before the first sessions I  uploaded all the maps (world, dungeon, and some wilderness encounters), as well as monster and npc tokens I would maybe need for several sessions. 

But now all I have to do is just roll encounters before a game.  It's all up to the players entirely on where to go and what to do.  I get to use my brain power during the session to run monsters during encounters and describe what's happening.  

No more laying down ""track"" of where players can go or trying to predict their movements.  Oh, you want to abandon the town under siege and go off into the mountains to go hunting?  Sure, you have the rations?  

No more fretting over balanced encounters.  Players  (mostly) approach the world and encounters with extreme caution because characters can actually die. I get to just enjoy listening to them strategize on what to do.  

No more DC nonsense. Roll under for an ability or over for a save.  Me and the players just decide when it's necessary, and often times it isnt unless its stated.  

Dungeon and wilderness exploration is guided by clear cut procedures. 

Combat procedures, in particular, ensure encounters are strategic and dramatic. No three hour slogs.  Characters die, but nothing ever seems unfair or contrived.  

No more thinking of mission hooks.  At first it was gold the players were after to level up, but over time the players, not me, built the story based on their actions.  Treasure is still a top priority, though.  

At the end of a session all I do is make a couple of notes on how the players actions may influence the world, record some of their ideas about what they think is happening and then, before next session roll up a few more encounters.  

I know this whole new dnd book is releasing this month, but I loathe the idea of having to go back and building the game while I'm driving it.  

After a year and half of play on my last 5e campaign I was totally burnt out and frustrated.  After a year and half of play on my OSE campaigns (plural) we are going strong and can't wait for the next session.  

I know I'm preaching to the choir with this but dang, coming B/X OSE was the best decision I ever made in the hobby.   It is a truly remarkable ttrpg system.

1j8em6w,Why anyone told me about Cairn before?,"Man, I wish someone had told me about Cairn two years ago when I was still grinding through 5E. Like, where was this game when I was flipping through spell lists and juggling ability modifiers? It’s just so clean—no fuss, no bloat, just straight to the good stuff.

The way it handles characters, exploration, and danger is exactly what I didn’t know I was looking for back then. No rigid classes, just who you are and what you carry. And the game actually trusts you to be creative instead of boxing you into a list of pre-approved actions. It’s wild how much freedom it gives without ever feeling loose or undefined.

If I had known about Cairn back then, I probably would’ve spent way less time stressing over mechanics and way more time actually playing.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ba5d2360>,osr,1741654480.0
1i4wq5y,Running 5e showed me how much I love OSR principles,"I ran D&D5e for the first time in about 4 years last night, at a one-shot event for strangers hosted at a local cafe, and it was the most unwieldy, inelegant and unsatisfying GMing experience I’ve had in years.

I put a party of 4 Level 1 PCs through ‘Barrow of the Bone Blaggards’ by Necrotic Gnome because I know it pretty much off by heart. 5e’s lack of exploration procedures and dungeon turns, as well as how distinctly special and overpowered even a Level 1 party is, was infuriating. Darkvision, cantrips, and many class features just make it a complicated and poor situation.

However, by far the worst offender was the Skill system. I had to shut down players calling for their own skill checks: “You step carefully into the murky chamber-“ “Perception - 11, damn!” “Please, just let me finish and roll when I ask you to.” The players constantly insisted on contextualising everything from the myriad numbers on their sheets as opposed to making in-universe decisions.

The players had a good time, and I didn’t show my frustrations, but it was so disappointing that they couldn’t get the full experience due to the leeway given by a bloated and weak system.

I’ve never felt more vindicated that the OSR/NSR/rules-light space is the place for me. I’ll be sticking with my staples of Cairn, OSE, Vaults of Vaarn, X-Borgs, Into the Odd, and Mothership from now on!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ba635e80>,osr,1737287114.0

1h925nb,A 'What' Fiend?,"Laying in bed, bored with bronchitis today, when a post on here gave me a flashback to an old gaming memory. It hearkens back to when 'meta-gaming' was something a lot of people still took seriously. This might get long, but I'm not going anywhere for a while, so let's get started.  

Back in the mid-90s, I was talking with my original DM, the guy who got me into the game and passed away from alcoholism this February at the age of 46. We always took turns DMing, but we never got to play together because no one else in our groups liked DMing. He said we should go see if there were any postings at the local hobby store (local being 45 miles away). So, we did, and the owner of the establishment told us about this group of older guys who were looking for two new members, gave us their number, and sent us on our way.  

We called the number and talked for a while and they agreed to bring us in for a game and see if we were a good fit. We were like 17 and 18 at the time and these guys were all in their forties and had been playing since before we were born. Also, they were all bounty hunters, police officers, and such, so we were very intimidated. Nice guys, though!  

We chatted for a while before the game, asking each other about our experiences with the game, cool gaming memories, and so on. Turns out this group of three players and the DM had been playing since 1977, with the same guy DMing every session. They started a new campaign when 2nd Edition came out in '89, and this game we were taking part in was that campaign, like eight years into it! And they were all only around 10th level. Made us feel like munchkiny power gamers!  

So, during the session, I'm doodling on a piece of paper. I was drawing a pit fiend, and one of the guys said, ""Whoa, what is that you're drawing?"" I said, ""It's a pit fiend...?"" thinking everyone knows what that is, right? But they all got up and bent down to look at it and were just oohing and ahing. One of them asked, ""You've fought one of these before? Did you live?"" And it struck me just how dedicated and hardcore these guys were about D&D.  

Not just the giant hand drawn, framed world map hanging behind the DM's chair, or the fifty page campaign bibles they printed out for us detailing their eight year long adventure, or the expertly painted minis and custom battle mats, but these mother fuckers had been playing D&D for twenty years, and since they had never fought a pit fiend, they didn't even know what it was!  

We explained that we were both DMs too, and we were looking for the game because we never got to play together, and they understood. But one of them said, ""Ah, that must take a lot of the magic and mystery out of the game when you're a player."" And that's when I told him, ""Dude, we've been playing for like six hours now and I've never encountered a single thing I've seen here tonight before. All of your magic items, the monsters we've fought, all of this is new to me, and I've read pretty much every DM's book printed."" They all looked at their DM who was grinning from ear to ear.  

No one said anything else about it after that, we just went back to playing. But I think those guys got a much greater understanding of what an incredible DM they had, and my friend and I got a look at what great players could be. Anyway, I'm gonna go hit the cough medicine and pass out, just felt like sharing a memory!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ba67af90>,osr,1733605276.0
1i9wjwb,My moment of validation as an old-school GM,"I've been playing TTRPGs for \~32 years (most of that as a GM). A couple of years ago, I reconnected with a childhood friend and he asked me to run a virtual game for him and his buddies. I tried 5e and failed. I just couldn't get comfortable with the game, so I suggested an old-school game. I ran a series of unconnected modules for about a year. For the past 8 months, I've been running a popular megadungeon. Last night, this occurred:

>Player 1: ""I gotta tell you, I haven't felt this way about roleplaying since I was a kid.""

>Just then, Player 2 found a strange pebble on the body he was looting. Jokingly, he tried to activate it as if it were an Ioun stone. I told him that it began circling his head.

>Player 1: ""What!? What is that?""

>Player 2: ""I think we just found an Ioun stone."" (they did)

>Player 1: ""Holy shit! This really is JUST like the games back in the day. That's awesome!""

I felt since the artbook was made to look like a game manual for an old PC game, styling this text game to look like an old MS-DOS terminal was very fitting.

It is a short and unfinished demo, but there are secrets.

1bkr7y5,Day one of Gary Con XVI is on the books and...wow.,"This is my first year after putting it off and making excuses all that time. The loss of Jennell Jaquays and the 50th anniversary are what finally broke this camel's back.

So far, I'm in awe. Back in my hotel room now, and my head is still buzzing.

I met and conversed with the likes of Ed Greenwood, Erol Otus, Larry Elmore, Jeff Easley, Tim Kask, Darlene, Diesel LaForce, and Mike Pondsmith. I almost got my cleric's dumb ass melted by acid in a delightful B/X dungeon crawl run by Douglas Niles. I bought way too many books from grodog at the Black Blade booth.

Last, and perhaps most importantly, I got to experience the original Braunstein scenario with Dave Wesely. A staggering nineteen other players (including Ben Milton of the Questing Beast YouTube show) were utterly consumed by the amazing historical fantasy.

For those who don't know, Braunstein I is a freeform RPG pre-dating D&D that's set in a fictional Prussian city of the same name circa 1790. Every player is given a character with unique goals and victory conditions. These include university students, local nobility and merchants, traveling entertainers, French spies, and more. The roleplay element is almost 100% at the forefront, with dice being rolled only once during this evening's session to resolve a duel (that my character lost). I played the leader of the democratic student revolutionaries who also happened to be the Baron's spoiled son. I went to jail, got part of my ear chopped off, and ended up marrying a prominent banker's beautiful daughter (played by a very nice bald fellow). A thoroughly engrossing and educational ride.

To call Dave a master GM would be a colossal understatement. Never in my 3.5 or so decades of play have I beheld another on his level. Just a natural born storyteller who brought the time period to life and enabled us all to produce this crazy improvised soap opera with these complex relationship webs and dark secrets and such. The sheer craft and insight, the way every simple answer to a question led into a sly suggestion.The man's a wonder. It's humbling, really.

In fact, I think the reason I'm still giddy because I feel like I learned so much from him in so short a time that my brain has only started unpacking and processing it all. It would be like an amateur painter today getting to take a lesson with a Rembrandt or Picasso or something.

Bless Dave for still coming out at nearly 80 years of age and showing people like me firsthand how roleplaying began, years before any sort of proper roleplaying game as we would recognize it now was even on the market.

1gka7c6,Cairn 2e thoughts,"Holy shit, I just read through Cairn 2e, and I’m seriously impressed. It’s got two books—the Player’s Guide and the Warden’s Guide—and together they offer everything you could ask for and pull you in to a really interesting and unique new setting. The new classes in the Player’s Guide are exactly the kind of thing that makes you want to start rolling up a character on the spot. The names are a little funky (""Jongluer"" instead of ""Bard,"" for example), but it’s all part of the vibe and work when taken all together.

The art nails it, too—simple and not distracting mostly, but fun where it matters in the class descriptions with unique things like robot arms and fungal mutations to support the quirky setting. The rules stay super-lite but with enough added structure to really support a long-term game for just about anyone. I love rules-lite games and this really hits a sweet spot for simple rules with just enough support. Plus, both books are super readable, with clean layouts and artwork that’s atmospheric without trying too hard.

The second book, the Warden’s Guide, completely nails it on the world-building side. The d20 tables absolutely rock. Every entry flows, no awkward combos, and the map creation tools and dungeon building systems are set up to balance detail without bogging you down. Everything item on every list has clearly been carefully curated and considered before being included. The hex crawl rules are right on target for me, too. Everything fits together smooth as hell. I haven't been this excited to bust out the paper and pencils and build something from scratch in a long time! Super cool!

Character advancement’s always been a bit of a question mark for me with Cairn, but the examples here make it a lot easier to grasp. I’m not totally sold yet, but I’m much more open to trying it out with these examples for support.

**And the best part: Yochai Gal released both books for free! Nearly 300 pages of pro-quality content, and he didn’t charge a single dime.** In the OSR scene these days, it’s rare to see something of this caliber free of charge, and it’s a super classy move, right up there with Chris Gonnerman's BFRPG, Charlie Mason's White Box, and other classic pillars of the community. Cairn’s had a huge fanbase for a while, but with the extra content in Cairn 2e it really feels like a new classic to me now. 

Reading these books totally made my day. I can't wait to roll up some guys and send them on a quest! 

Epic props and gratitude to Yochai Gal—masterful work. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ba6eb740>,osr,1730822858.0
1csuiwm,OSRIC 3.0 Mission Statement,"Matt Finch of Mythmere Games just published OSRIC mission statement at the [Knights & Knaves Alehouse](https://knights-n-knaves.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?p=310619&sid=bc9df66ac8e684285312387ec9ff9e5d#p310619):

*Since the “OSRIC's Path Forward” thread, there has been more discussion about OSRIC, licensing, and so forth.*

*Stuart and I are working on an OSRIC 3.0, but it will be under the AELF License (a Mythmere Games license that's similar to the OGL). OSRIC 3.0 will be produced by Mythmere Games, and we are planning (tentatively) for a Kickstarter in September or October of this year.*

*A few points:*

*1) Simply maintaining OSRIC under the OGL is possible at this time, but in the long run I think it's a bit of a risk. WotC can probably cut off access to new users of the OGL at any time by “withdrawing the open offer”. I don't think I'm giving WotC a roadmap here; they almost certainly are aware of this approach to the license. They wanted to do more than that to kill it quickly, but there's a much more reliable way to poison it over time, which is simply to withdraw the offer to “sign on” to the OGL. But after the massive backlash to their attempt to kill the license at one blow, they will have to wait a while before mentioning the OGL again. This potential future withdrawal of the offer would create a problem for anyone new who wanted to publish something for OSRIC, so it behooves us to move to a different license now, before the axe eventually comes down.*

*2) The ORC license has some problems with easy usability. I won't go into those because it's complicated and also because there's discussion about it in lots of other places. The AELF License, since it works in the same way as the OGL, is familiar enough that it can be adopted relatively easily by anyone familiar with the OGL.*

*3) OSRIC 3.0 is intended to be completely backward-compatible with OSRIC 2.0, and it shouldn't require any “new versions” of adventures that have been published in the past. There might turn out to be minor glitches in terms of backward compatibility, but those will be the exception.*

*4) The reasons for coming out with a new version:*

*a) First, the license, as mentioned above.*

*b) Secondly, it's to meet the needs of a younger batch of gamers in a context where the PDFs of the original books are available from WotC (which wasn't the case when we originally published OSRIC 2.0). This means several different avenues of approach.*

*—– The writing style will use bullet points and other visual call-outs to avoid the “wall of text” effect. Even those of us raised in pre-internet days are starting to find the bullet-point arrangement preferable to a long block that doesn't visually separate and organize the more important elements of the text.*

*— We're going to include a VTT-friendly method of scale since so many people now game online.*

*— We're going to try to make this version what EOTB calls a “teaching edition,” meaning lots of guidance for playing the game. The “how to play” information is in the original books to a degree, but it can be presented at the forefront and that's what anyone new to the whole OSR needs. Also, AD&D is simply more complex than other OSR games like B/X, so it needs to be presented in a step-by-step format that draws the learner into the process.*

*More information to come later.*

Great move to focus on teaching and accessibility!

First edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons is packed to the brim with stuff that stood the test of time, but its presentation and density sometimes scares people away.

Stuart and Matt are more than capable in producing text that is both inspiring and informative—hence I'm looking very much forward to OSRIC 3.0.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ba718cb0>,osr,1715803916.0

1bo5yxe,Filtering out AI content on Drivethrurpg,"This came up in my most recent News Roundup, and I realized that I hadn't checked out Drivethru's filtering system recently. Last year, prior to the upgrade of the new website, when one set up a new title you were asked to check a box if any AI assets were used in the creation of the title, and, if they were, this fact was displayed fairly prominently on the title listing.

Now, they've moved that to the filters listing, a longish table that has a bunch of different filters, and AI/handmade is an option way at the bottom, under ""Creation Method"". I've uploaded a few titles since the change, and I didn't even notice the filter. What is more frustrating is that titles are not explicitly called out as having AI assets. In order to sift through them, you have to actively filter for them (Format --> Creation Method --> AI or Handmade). I'm also not sure how accurate the filtering is, as it includes Sine Nomine's Cities Without Number as having AI assets, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't.

I've reached out to Drivethru via and Publisher's Discord and asked if they can restore the previous visible tag to each title listing so that it is much easier to tell if a product contains AI assets or not. I know this is a hot topic amongst gamers, and some folks might be dismissive of the concerns of myself and others, but I wanted to post this in case folks don't know how to filter out the AI content, or, if you feel strongly about it, might want to contact Drivethru and ask them to restore the previous tags.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ba7b8890>,osr,1711453913.0

1h21gf7,Ancient Mesopotamia in OSR,"So, I’m a NELC (Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations) student, and for a final project in one class the professor floated the idea of making an RPG module based on Ancient Mesopotamia. I’ve been contemplating the idea of fleshing out the project into a full module and setting book for an OSR-rules game, as I’ve been playtesting my project document with friends and having a ball, and thought it would be fun to get some feedback from the OSR community.

Are any of you interested in the idea of an OSR game based in third millennium Ancient Mesopotamia?

As a player, what would you want to see in a campaign like this? Is there anything you know about the setting—or want to learn more about—that you think you’d enjoy seeing in a campaign?

What sort of information would you want as a GM to bring Ancient Mesopotamia to life?

—

My own research focus is on deities and mythology so those feature prominently in the campaign. Yesterday I ran an adventure loosely based on Gilgameš’s encounter with the legendary forest guardian Humbaba, and the players ended up spending six hours exploring Humbaba’s curse-protected forest and collecting items to help them with their final confrontation with him.

I’m also a really big fan of linguistics and can’t help myself but to include a lot of Sumerian in my project. One feature my friends/players seemed to really enjoy is the ability to construct their own ancient Sumerian names - most of these names are theophoric (e.g., people are named after a deity, usually in a short sentence like “Enki provides”) so I was able to give players a list of name formulas with translations to plug a god’s name into and make a wholly unique name for their character. Outside of naming schemes, it’s actually kind of neat from an academic perspective how fast they picked up Sumerian words and phrases! I think the language additions add a lot of flavor to the campaign. 😊

As a DM and as a player, I really love the OSR philosophy of encouraging lateral thinking and rewarding creative problem-solving. Historical settings are fun to explore with that mindset, as many mythological beings can be quite dangerous but don’t necessarily have malevolent intentions. OSR in general feels like the perfect rules system to explore a setting like this. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bb8123c0>,osr,1732815923.0
1csar1u,I've been running open tables at local game stores for the past 11 years. Here is how I made it happen.,"I mentioned in a thread here in /r/osr that I have been running open table games since 2013. /u/Radiant_Situation_32 asked for a post about how I was successful doing it. I'll try to keep this as brief as possible and then answer questions in the comments if anyone has any. (If anyone is even interested.) The biggest factors in my success are the last 3 bullets. AMA I guess?

* I started with Pathfinder Society in 2013. The first time I ever played a game it was an open, public table. 

* The first time I ever ran a game was a Pathfinder Society table. I only ran the game because the GM ghosted the 6 players that showed up to play. I went into it completely unprepared having never seen the module until I picked it up to start running it. The players helped and were very understanding. 

* After spending some time with Pathfinder Society I decided that the rules in Pathfinder were too restrictive. I got into an argument with the Venture Captain for the area about how many people I was allowed to have at the table and never ran PFS again.

* I missed that open table feel so I went looking for something else. I came across Dungeon Crawl Classics. I got a free copy of the full rulebook on Free RPG Day. I read it and LOVED it, but no one in my area was playing it. 

* I decided to steal Pathfinder Society's model and start running local open tables for DCC. (Unaware at the time that Goodman Games has an organized play program called Road Crew). 

* I partnered with a local game store and got permission to run my game. I advertised here on Reddit in my city's local sub, I advertised in a meetup for local gamers, and I posted on Facebook in a local geeks community group. That first game 3 people showed up. 2 of them were there because they are good friends and didn't want to see me fail at this new idea. The other guy saw the ad in the geek group and decided to come out. (I haven't seen him at a game since). So my first DCC game was 3 people. SUCCESS! 

* I enjoyed it so much I did it again a month later. That time I advertised in all the same places and had close to 25 people show up. I guess showing it was on a regular schedule made people believe in it more. I found 2 other players willing to run games and we split the tables up as best we could. 

* DCC was so popular I expanded to doing it twice a month. Then eventually ever Saturday. The other players were not willing to run games other than occasionally, so I dealt with it. Sometimes dealing with it meant running for 14 players at the same time. It sucked. It was awful, but **not a single player got turned away**. (Which was with my argument with the head of Pathfinder Society was about. I wanted too many players at my table according to PFS rules.)

* I expanded to running twice a week at the local game store. One weekend day, one week day. 

* Shortly after my switch to twice a month I started a local Facebook group called Reno Dungeon Crawlers. I used that to advertise and find people to play in my games. (The group currently sits at 1200 members.) 

* I allowed other people to find players and referees in the group. This helped expand my reach. My group is by far the most popular locally in terms of finding an RPG game. We have groups running games almost every day of the week who find players in that group. 

* Since starting the group and running games on a regular basis I've run a number of different games. Metamorphosis Alpha, Original D&D, Swords & Wizardry (several different variations), Paranoia, Mork Borg, Old-School Essentials, OSRIC, and a bunch more I'm probably forgetting. 

* My last completed campaign was a 2.5 year OSE campaign. I had a home brew world and used the hex map from the Isle of Dread to let the players hex crawl. When we finished that campaign they had established their own stronghold.

* Unless I was deathly ill, or the roads were no good (we get a lot of snow here) **I never cancelled a game.** I firmly believe this is a huge part of my success. 

* **I never turn away a player who wants to play.** Even if I have too many players I ask them to bear with me and help me make it work. People are generally accommodating. 

* On the converse side **I never don't run the game.** If a game is scheduled I run it, even if only 2 people show up, I run it. We make it work. 

The bottom line is if you want it to be successful, you have to be dedicated to it and put in the work. The only time I haven't had active, public, open play tables is during covid when the store was shut down to gatherings. The weekend it opened back up I was masked up with my players back in the store.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bb82d4c0>,osr,1715741900.0

1eqjtny,"His Majesty the Worm: tarot-driven, slice-of-life megadungeon exploration","Hello!

For the past 8 years, I've been working on a game called **_His Majesty the Worm_**.

# What is His Majesty the Worm?

*His Majesty the Worm* is a new-school game with old-school sensibilities: the classic megadungeon experience given fresh life through a focus on the mundanities and small moments of daily life inside the dungeon.

* **Food, hunger, light,** and **inventory management** are central to play and actually fun.

* **Tarot cards** are used to create an action-packed combat system that ensures that all players have interesting choices every minute of combat: no downtime!

* The game has **robust procedures.** Adventure in the Underworld, rest in roleplaying-driven camping scenes, and plot long-term schemes in the City at the center of the Wide World.

* The relationships between companions, called **Bonds,** powers the rest and recovery mechanic of the game. The game centers the human element. 

The game is intended for a traditional setup between a single GM and 3-6 players. It emphasizes long-term, Metroidvania-like play. Tarot cards are used as a randomizing element. If you like things like _Dungeon Meshi_ or _Rat Queens_, you might find something fun in this game.

**You can learn more about the game, and find links to buy either the physical or digital editions, [on our website](https://www.hismajestytheworm.games/)!**

(When it launched, the physical edition sold out within 3 hours. The books are now restocked at Exalted Funeral!)

1j7t0zp,Was 5e originally considered a triumph for the old school?,"I was watching the interview between Ben Milton and Mike Mearls, and at one point, Ben mentioned that when 5e first launched, the OSR community initially saw it as a victory for their style of play—but over time, that perception soured.  

I wasn’t around the OSR at the time—I only discovered it after 2020—but that idea resonates with me. Even before I became disillusioned with 5e and moved toward OSR games, I remember 5e in 2014 feeling much closer to the experience I wanted. It wasn’t so much the original system that pushed me away, but how both the system and its community evolved over time. A Knight at the Opera [wrote a post that](https://knightattheopera.blogspot.com/2024/10/in-mouth-of-madness.html) really captured my feelings on this shift. Even now, I feel like I'd be happy to run a campaign using *Into the Unknown,* or even 2014 PHB-only with some hacks.  

So, for those who were active in the OSR back in 2014: Does Ben’s description of the community’s reaction sound accurate? If so, did the OSR community ultimately reject 5e because their initial reaction was inaccurate in ways that become more clear over time; or did the game start in a place that mostly aligned with OSR sensibilities before drifting away?

1j647sw,Does anyone else feel like the scene is getting stale?,"Not a rant, nor complaining, I’m trying to spark discussion. 

Does anyone else feel like the OSR scene is getting stale? I feel like I see way fewer blog posts nowadays, and that every recent product release is either:

1) A rehash of a game (often OSE or Mork Borg)we already have with a few house rules. 

2) An art piece masquerading as a TTRPG product. Utterly unusable at the table and only hood to look at. 

Maybe I’m just out of the loop but it seems like we’re getting so much less new and creative stuff nowadays. That’s not to say that there’s nothing new and creative (Crowns 2e is cool!), just that the days of endless truly creative stuff is gone. 

Truly, I fear that we have reached the end point of commercialization in our niche hobby. It is easier and more lucrative to appeal to TTRPG book collecters rather than TTRPG player, and thus we see more and more product focused at them. 

Or matbe I’m full of doom and gloom. Perhaps I have rose tinted glasses on for the past. I was not there after all, so perhaps I am mythologizing what came before. 

So like, are things getting more stale? Are they getting less interesting? Or am I just losing it?

1d5uzix,Knave 2e disappointment? Other opinions?,"Just got Knave 2e physical book in the mail. The hardcover quality is good and the artwork by Peter Mullen is awesome!

I'm quite disappointed with the rules and content though . . . it seems so, I don't know, half-finished? Not play tested? It's hard to say but it seems like the content was just kind of mashed together without much thought.

A lot of the random tables seem like they were glued in to pad the page count  without any real context or explanation of how/when to use them. I know it's subjective but the entries aren't particularly inspiring to me either. I understand that it's  a matter of taste but it seems like ChatGPT could give me a similar list of 100 different types of fabric, etc . . . nothing is particularly novel or creative.

Some of the rules seem pretty half-baked, too. The number of encounter rolls per day using the hazard dice and the ration depletion seems off. The relic magic was very disappointing: basically just telling me as the GM to make something up by myself.

I loved the first version of Knave: so much value and play was crammed in 7 pages! I played the hell out of it! Just wondering what others' thoughts on Knave 2e are. I wanted to love this game . . . it was going to be my go to system but now I'm regretting the money I spent. Maybe I'm missing something?

Curious what others are thinking of Knave 2e . . .

EDIT:

I want to thank everyone for sharing their opinions! I think I came into the Kickstarter with the wrong expectations. The book and art are beautiful and I'm glad that many folks are having a great time with it at their table. I'll admit to not having played it yet and will give it a test drive in a dungeon. Good gaming all!

  
UPDATE (2 months later):

I took the advice of some of the folks in this thread and gave Knave 2e a solo spin in some dungeons. I used the new OSE Anthologies to play ""The Jeweler's Sanctum"" and ""Curse of the Maggot God"" using the Knave 2e rules. I had an alright time of it. Thanks to those who suggested I get more information and real experience with the rules. 

Knave 2e will not be my 'go to' system but I wanted to share my hopefully more balanced and informed experience below to be fair. Thanks again to all who commented to agree or disagree. 

  
POSITIVES IMO

+ Character creation: 

(a) I found a few tables that helped me create some interesting looking Knaves that were interesting and fun. But I had to go to the NPC section for this . . . 

+ Rules: 

(a) The rules translated well to the OSE dungeons and stats. It was quick and easy to resolve encounters. 

(b) The rules didn't require much in the way of conversion. I just used the AC stats in the module as written. Same as Knave 1e this was good. 

+ Encounters: 

(a) I used the overloaded dice and it was okay in the dungeon crawl. I had to ignore a couple of rolls for consecutive burnt torches. It wasn't that bad. The dungeons had their own 'shift' tables built into the random encounter tables so I used those for dungeon shifts. 

NEGATIVES IMO

- Character creation: 

(a) I didn't really prefer the 'careers' and their items. I traded most out for other stuff and it seemed weird rolling two often very disconnected backgrounds. 

(b) Still really not a fan of Relic magic. I love the idea but I didn't find the tables helpful enough in creating relics and Gods. The results were strange and hard to bind together into something workable and fun.

(c) Traveling to the NPC section for character details was a hassle. But that was my choice to spice up the characters to make cartoon sketches so not Knave 2e's problem.

- Encounters: 

(a) I tried using the random tables for dungeon shifts and they were really weird results that I would have struggled to use in the module as written. Thankfully these particular modules had 'shifts' that were written in so I used those instead.

-Gotta get the truck back and save beautiful green-eyed women.

-Jack rolling poorly on all checks.

-Warehouses that turn out to be labyrinthian dungeons.

-Mystical powers and health potions!

-The Three Storms mini-bosses.

-Monsters.

-Meta in tone.  Winks at itself.  Everyone is fully invested into their character and having a blast.

1byuzcy, I removed thief,"So I was always torn about thief. I liked the idea of a sneaky class and more unique classes in general. And my players are 5e players so they like as much clases as possibe.

I tried running a game without the thief because of some post I saw and I must say, I feel the diffrence. The players are more active because anyone can do thief stuff. Not just the thief. Suddenly they try things outside of the ""normal way"" ie, the wizard lockpicks, the fighter scouts and so on. Now the players think more actively while dungeneering. How to open the door, how to deal with traps, how to hide and so on.

I still like the thief. But I realy like the effect of removing it had on my group.

1cjz2ib,I love BFRPG ,"Not a particularly substantial or groundbreaking post, but I'd like to say that. I was first made aware of Basic Fantasy shortly into my journey into the OSR, which began in late 2015 after messing around with 5e for a while. The number one thing that blew me away then and continues to do so is the sheer *accessibility* of the entire product line. You can download every single released book and a ton of ""playtest"" content in PDF form on the website absolutely free of charge with no strings attached. (And if you decide to buy the books, they're sold super cheap. Basically at-cost) If that were the only thing it had going for it as compared to other RP systems, that would be good enough, but there's more!  
  
 It's a really elegant B/X clone with some ""quality of life"" changes such as separating race and class, and using ascending AC which may be more familiar to modern players. There are great tools for players and GMs on the website, and a lot of super helpful and friendly people on the boards. There's a reason this game continues to get recommended and stays visible among the seemingly never-ending sea of new releases, despite having been around since 2006. It just does everything right.   
  
The minor gripes some people seem to have, like the layout and art, don't really bother me at all personally. I think it's fine. It's charming. Things are easy enough to find. There's a searchable SRD on the website for edge cases, anyway. It's not as 'pure' a B/X clone as OSE, but it's charming and accessible. It's got staying power. You should check it out if you haven't, or pick it up again if it's been a while to take a good look at one of the original OSR rules sets which set the tone.

1dpmt2m,Having a harder time enjoying 5e since getting into the OSR,"I've gotten the supplies to run an OSR game (B/X), and the more I learn about OSR playstyle, the harder it is for me to enjoy 5e.

Something that is really frustrating now that I know it's not necessary is how everything in 5e is gated behind mechanics. You can come up with a great plan to infiltrate a party with a disguise, but if you roll low, then too bad.

(I know that does come to a large degree from DM playstyle, but it is pretty consistently how 5e DMs do it across the board)

It really feels like it limits your creativity. I want to do this cool thing, but my character didn't specialize for it so I guess I'll just only do *my thing*. 

It's harder to enjoy roleplay when much of social interaction gets limited by rolls and mechanics. The other day, a DM told us all to roll Insight or Perception, then outright told us the person we were speaking to was suspicious.

Gee. There was no other way to convey that.

5e combat, too, feels painfully long and drawn out.

In these types of discussion, it is always brought up that Super DM can run it totally different and way better in 5e. Perhaps, but the vast majority of 5e DMs still do these things.

Can anyone else relate? It's harder to enjoy 5e now, but 5e is still the only game people I know play. And I honestly don't feel like playing online with guys in their 50s, sorry.

EDIT: upset a lot of people with my comment about guys in their 50s. I don't have anything against yall; it's just that if I were to join an online group, I'd rather join people who are roughly within my generation. I'm sure you would prefer the same.

And now that I have it, all I can think is, ""Why was this $50?"" I back quite a few projects. I'm aware that this project is a little smaller than some others, but Andrew Kolb didn't even crowdfund and has made 2 books with 10x the content for less money.

I don't think there was any desire to overcharge, I think this was just bad contract negotiations by people who didn't know what they were doing.

1ddid38,The woes of overcoming 5e iniritia,"Up at the top, this isn't a rant, it's not even my woes.

So, I have a player who pretty recently discovered there are games other than D&D, and he's been having fun trying out systems and settings. We were talking about how he's found that he likes rules light systems, because he likes playing a character, and doesn't want combat meta to get in the way of that.

I mentioned that he should join my Knave game and see what D&D without the rules is like, so he did. In the first session he killed a jackalope, and at it when they got back to camp. NPCs let him know that this was a bad thing, as killing a jackalope is bad luck, and eating them is worse if there can be a worse. So the player knows he's cursed, and is just waiting for me to tell him to reroll a passed save of some kind. This has turned in to recurring joke at the table. He also failed a navigation roll while in the woods and got the party lost, so it's a recurring joke that his character ofter offers to be at the front of the group, but the group doesn't want him leading.

All this to say, he's bothered to tell me after multiple sessions how much fun he's having. So, he's tried to tell his other groups about it. And they don't get it. All they hear is that he has no cool abilities, the first time he fired off a spell, it failed, he's cursed, he got lost in the forest, and ""how is that fun, it sounds terrible?""

And all I can think is, ""Man, it's too bad they don't get to have this."" I get power fantasy. I've played lots of games. Even as a PC I've played a dragon, a half-zombie-ninja, a time mage. I'm not against gonzo fun. But I get sad that some people think that's the *only* way to have fun.

1f06xbr,More than 100 designers joined the game jam around my latest SRD so I decided to make the game it is based on free for everyone ,"Hey everyone,

A couple of months ago, I released a one page OSR-inspired tabletop role-playing game of axes, runes, spirits, and legends, called Songs and Sagas. My twitter post blew up in popularity with like 22K views and 500 likes (even more unreal IMO considering the current state of the platform). Anyway.

I was really proud of the core and exploration mechanics I had designed, so I decided to open-license the game and publish a free creator kit and SRD for everyone to use. I then organized a game jam on Itch, and over 100 designers jumped on board, currently working on their own products to be ""Carried in Songs and Sagas"" (naming monikers is so fun ^^).

Now that we have 100 participants in the jam, I decided to celebrate by making the game free for everyone!

You can download the game on [itch](https://fari-rpgs.itch.io/songs-and-sagas) or go to [songsandsagas.farirpgs.com](https://songsandsagas.farirpgs.com/) for more details around the game, creator kit, and what we plan to do next with the system.

Do keep an eye on the submission page of the jam because there are some pretty amazing designers working on their projects including the folks from A Couple of Drakes (Dead Belt, Court of Blades), Andrew Boyd of Pandion Games (Whispers in the Wall, Substratum Protocol), Matteo Sciutteri (Bloodstone, The Breach) and Alan Bahr of Gallant Knight Games(TinyD6, D6 System: Second Edition, SYMA)

1i0b2fd,Experience Report: Converting my 5e group to OSR (Dolmenwood),"I converted a group/campaign from a 5e, homebrew campaign to a Dolmenwood one. We’re super happy and it was extremely fun so far. Both my group and the game itself surprised me in some interesting ways.

All of the players were entirely new to RPGs when we started the 5e campaign half a year ago.

What we did:

They got new character sheets (from DW rules), starting at lvl 2, downleveled from their old ones but we found classes/races that are equivalent for most.

I allowed them to bring some stuff that were a good fit, like the ranger’s (now hunter) animal companion (downscaled to DW stats), a glamerweave cloak, some gold and basic gear etc.

I started with visit to a starting town (prigwort) and a clear hook for the suggested starting adventure in the book.

What I was worried about:

- That they would be annoyed by having less combat power and fewer spells (no cantrips)
- That they wouldn’t dig resource/time management, previously I hand waved encumbrance, and they didn’t have to count rations etc.
- Lethality, they are in love with their characters

What actually happened:

Initially one player (sorceress, now enchantress) complained a bit about having fewer powers. “I can’t do the fire thing now?” Etc. but down the line she was fully engaged and had a ton of fun.

They fully embraced resource management, travel, hexcrawling etc. they seem to love to buy stuff, prepare and gauge travel/search risk. I didn’t have to do any convincing.

They didn’t lose a single hitpoint and were able to defeat, like actually murder, a pretty large group of very dangerous enemies entirely through creative play.

I didn’t expect _that_.

I used the advice from the OSR community and the learnings from watching 3d6 DTL campaign. Telegraph danger, be fair but tough, roll in the open etc.

I expected they would perhaps default to sneaking around, avoid danger and pick their fights. But they completely turned the situation upside down. Used intrigue, clever investigations and made allies etc. their only combat situation was a surprise attack that was over in 1 round.

I’m blessed to have such a cool group. But there’s also another factor: OSR _works_.

The way adventures, situations etc. are written, allows for all of these unexpected solutions. The advice that is given to GMs, helps players to find awesome solutions and embrace the challenges.

Even the stuff that seems “cumbersome” like encumbrance and resources, is actually fun and immersive.

There’s something to be said about limiting character powers, but having rich environments and situations that inspire players to find their own, unique approach.

1d83fvc,"On 5e Youtubers, and the OSR Playstyle.","Maybe it's just me, but I've noticed something recently in the content of many popular 5e youtubers, like Ginny Di, Deficient Master, Bob World Builder, and a few others.

The thing is that in their most recent videos where they explain how to write and scructure adventures and run games they seem to take the approaches that we've been doing for a long time: letting the emergent narrative do its thing, and have players solve problems with wits rather than mechanical power.

When 5e was at its most popular, railroads also were. Adventures were linear and structured, and challenges had clear, skill-check-based solutions. Now the trend is in the opposite direction:

* Ginny Di is talking about letting the players set their own goals in-backstory and letting the narrative play out automatically, rather than planning it. By the way she talks about this, it seems like she's unaware (?) that all this is remarkably OSR-adjacent. I'm quite possibly wrong.
* Deficient Master regualrly hints at his OSR inspiration, and often adapts OSR concepts to the mechanics of 5e and the tastes of the 5e audience.
* Bob World Builder is the one of these three that most closely uses the structure of OSR games, and most often engages with OSR products directly. He recommends Cairn as ""the default starter RPG"", and recommends trying Shadowdark before moving to 5e after that. In other circumstances, he states that the best 5e starter set is Icespire Peak, which is the one that most closely, IMO, resembles OSR playstyle.

As I write this in my deranged frenzy, I ask you: is it just me, or is the OSR slowly leaking out into the 5e community? Is this a sign that the OSR is gonna become mainstream in the TTRPG community at large?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bbc43fe0>,osr,1717523542.0

We released our first products at Gen Con 2000 and a few months after that we jumped into publishing d20 content for Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Ed. In ’01 we picked up [Gary Gygax](https://trolllord.com/worlds-of-gary-gygax/) and became his primary publisher.

Being a gamer all of my life, I love to talk gaming and decided it was time I reached out again to the RPG community here on Reddit and spend the evening answering any questions you wonderful folks on Reddit may have!

**My short bio:** My name is Stephen Chenault, one of the founding members and present CEO of Troll Lord Games. We make table top role playing games! Our flagship product is Castles & Crusades, a fast-paced, easy-to-learn OGL game. We launched in 1999 (though I started gaming back in the woebegone days of the 1970s) with a series of adventures and world settings. Within a few short months, we had signed on Gary Gygax, launched our fantasy game [Castles & Crusades](https://trolllord.com/castles-crusades/), our modern, Multi-Genre RPG, [Amazing Adventures](https://trolllord.com/amazing-adventures/), and a host of other projects and games. We’ve published books for both 3rd edition D&D and 5th edition D&D. We just did a soft announcement of our new rpg that is on the horizon, [BARSOOM: The Roleplaying Game](https://trolllord.com/barsoom/).

**The Job:** My primary job is managing the day-to-day operations of Troll Lord Games, from conception to printing. I do a fair bit of writing for the company for both Castles & Crusades and the [World of Aihrde](https://trolllord.com/world-of-aihrde/), as well as fiction and reference material. I do two weekly Twitch shows, a weekly AMA and Troll Round Up, and I also blog about all sorts of things, from world-building to the alien crash at Roswell! Currently, my focus lies on the release of the Codex of the Planes, The Dungeons of Aufstrag, and fiction material for the world of Aihrde.

**Ask me Anything!** I’ll answer just about anything I can from TLG news and history, to working with Gary Gygax, general RPGs, C&C, projects we’ve released/are releasing/plan to release, industry news, game design, setting design, , or whatever enters your noodle space!

1e43utr,OSR formating has ruined my desire to read other edition products (in a good way),"Hi all, 

let me start by saying I am most probably one of the young DMs here. I started playing in 3e, skipped 4e  played a lot of 5e and since then embraced OSR. 

My favorite way of DMing, is having a world, build adventures in it, but most importantly bring bought adventures in it as well. So I often buy products that get good reviews by Bryce and run them as somewhat modified side quests.

I am not an absolutist. I think good adventures can be found in all systems, that's why I also buy 5e stuff from time to time. And that's why I felt writing this post. 

The last one I got my hands on is called The Devil's Bridge. A Slavic adventure. Witcher inspired. I thought cool. It's free. Double cool. I open it, 170 pages. It starts with disclaimers, pronunciation guides, long paragraphs of who knows what information. And it got me thinking. 

Do I like OSR for what it stands for or just because many good adventures strive to present the information to the DM in a way that they can use them on the table? Well, both. But the second is a revelation. 5e adventures may be good, but unusable. This Devil's Bridge could have been 80 pages. Easily. And it's not just this. This is just the latest culprit on my list. 

Have you also felt like that? I think it's a shame, to have potentially good products hidden in between paragraphs of backstory and unusable information. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bbcfe7b0>,osr,1721071988.0
1gv2ra4,Why do Mages Build Towers...,"as opposed to mansions or castles or something else?

1e23nh3,Cairn spellbooks are actually software.,"Yeah, it sounds weird, but hear me out. For those unfamiliar with Cairn (why, it's just 24 pages and free!), everyone can cast a spell here, but you need to have a spellbook in both hands and read it aloud. But here is the thing — each spellbook can contain only one spell. It's actually a pretty elegant decision from a mechanical point of view, considering how much emphasis Cairn puts on inventory management.

But one day I read that some user criticized this system, because it sounds kinda illogical. Only one spell will occupy an entire book? And at first, I kinda agreed that it's just one thing you have to accept as it is, even if it may look wrong. But after some shower thoughts, I had a realization. We need to see those spellbooks as actual software.

First, you have the frontend part, which is your actual GUI, all those shiny buttons you press. That's the part which the spellcaster needs to read aloud to activate the spell. This part can be pretty short, and that's why casting spells doesn't take that long. But after that, you have the backend part, your actual code, or in this case, your spell. This is a combination of symbols, letters, and all other stuff written in a very specific way to trigger the effects.

And as your GUI may be as simple as two or three buttons, the actual logic for those can have thousands lines of code. And that's exactly why you may have one spell, which will occupy an entire book. At least, that's the explanation I will make canon at my table.

So yeah, thanks for reading this weird idea!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bbd57290>,osr,1720852081.0
1g0i6gy,Do people actually like weirdness?,"Note that I mean weird as in the aesthetic and vibe of a work like Electric Archive or Ultraviolet Grasslands, rather than pure random nonsense gonzo. 

This is a question I think about a lot. Like are people actually interesting in settings and games that are weird? Or are people preferential to standard fantasy-land and its faux-medeival trappings?

I understand that back in the day, standard fantasy-land was weird. DnD was weird. But at the same time, we do not live in the past and standard fantasy-land is co-opted into pop culture and that brings expectatione. 

I like weird, I prefer it even, but I hate the idea of working on something only for it to be met with the stance of “I want my castles and knights”.

1c0s6t3,"My long-awaited desert-ocean toolbox setting guide, SEAS OF SAND, is now available!","Hello!

[*Seas of Sand* is now available in hardcover](https://spacepenguin.ink/products/seas-of-sand) and on [itch.io](https://headofthegoat.itch.io/seas-of-sand) and [DriveThruRPG](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/475328/Seas-of-Sand) digitally!

*Seas of Sand* is a 264-page toolbox setting guide (think like *Veins of the Earth* or *Into the Wyrd & Wild*) about a vast desert ocean. By day, the sands are liquid: ships sail and people sink. By night, the sands cool and harden: ships freeze in place, but people can walk. Included are mapping procedures to make your own Seas; each of the seven sands that compose the desert-oceans; dozens of fauna (monsters), flora (plants), and phenomena (weird stuff); some lightweight rules for ships, travel, crews, and trade; and more tables than you can shake a stick at, including 1d100 encounters for each of the seven sands. On itch and DriveThru, you can download the first 87 pages for free, which includes mapping, the seven sands, and all of the rules-y stuff, but none of the field guide or the many appendices. 

It's been a very long road (as my Kickstarter backers will know lol) but the book is finally here. While the team behind the book is pretty big—an editor, a proofreader, a cover artist, a cartographer, and a consultant—the vast majority of the work was done by me, Sam. I wrote nearly all the words, did all of the graphic dessign, and illustrated all of the ~150ish interior pieces. This book has been a labor of love for many years and nearly killed me several times.

I hope you enjoy [*Seas of Sand!*](https://spacepenguin.ink/products/seas-of-sand)",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bbdcc860>,osr,1712772483.0

As a kid, I wanted to love *Ravenloft*. But, Hammer and Universal Horror weren't my horror. I grew up in a small town and, for me, the movies on the shelves at my rental store were, you know, of a different quality. So, twenty-five years later, I decided to make the *Ravenloft* that I wanted as a teen, one that's based on schlock horror, midnight movies, and surreal films.

*Gladestrom* is a 200-page hex crawl of highly interlinked dungeons, encounters, and events where each location is inspired by a pre-2000s movie. Every location is highly interlinked with other locations, which means that quests, missions, and more are all built in. **It aims to be a zero-prep setting.** At present, there are roughly 100 mapped locations, countless NPCs, and enough rumors to push players into dangerous situations.

**It's entirely free.**

If you made it this far, I appreciate your time. And, if you decide to check out – or even play – in the world, I'd love to hear about your experience or any guidance you have on making *Gladestrom* more usable, interesting, or enjoyable.

1h4yjuy,How big are megadungeons?,"Instead of chiming in on every thread about megadungeons to point out that Caverns of Thracia isn’t a megadungeon, I’m going to post some data around the most commonly-cited megadungeons to try to ground the discourse in empirical terms.

Adventure / number of rooms

Caverns of Thracia: 116

Castle Xyntillan: 350+

Barrowmaze: 400+

Stonehell: 700+

Gunderholfen: 900+

Rappan Athuk: 1000+

Arden Vul: 2000+

For some non-megadungeon context:

Caves of Chao (KotB): 58

Hole in the Oak: 57

Incandescent Grottoes: 58

HitO and IG combined (a suggestion made by many fans of the dungeons): 115

Megadungeons are often defined as being big enough to support an entire campaign, or being practically un-finishable. Real-world campaign length is typically measured in sessions. At a modest 8 rooms per session, we get roughly:

Hole in the Oak: 7 sessions

Thracia: 15

Xyntillan: 45

Barrowmaze: 50

Stonehell: 90

Gunderholfen: 110

RA: 120

AV: 250

In those terms, I’d characterize HitO and Thracia as big dungeons finishable in several levels of play, Xyntillan as a tentpole that will occupy almost all of a level 1-6 campaign, and Barrowmaze as finishable only by the most dedicated groups playing to level 8+. All the megadungeons beyond that fit the ‘you can’t finish/beat them‘ definition.

The discourse around megadungeons has been going on for around 15 years now. In that period, Thracia has been recognized as a classic. And yet it’s only the last few years that I’ve seen it referred to as a megadungeon. So something has changed in the discourse.

It seems that as the popularity of megadungeons has increased (not least as a marketing term), its meaning on forums has expanded to the point that it’s applied to any dungeon that’s larger than average size, or takes more than a handful of sessions to play.

Another factor might be the focus in today’s OSR on relatively short, low-level campaigns that wrap up by 5th level. In that context, something like Thracia is closer to a whole-campaign dungeon.

This post might come across as grouchy and pedantic. But my livelihood involves both writing and precision, so I’m genuinely fascinated with how language evolves and meanings change and expand.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bbf0d8b0>,osr,1733155955.0

Over 12,000 cases of “Satanic Ritual Abuse” were reported, and guess what? Not a shred of real evidence. Just vibes and fear.

1ife00w,Nostalgia is such a trap,"I bought the $5 pdf of the Village of Hommlet. I wish I hadn't, but I wouldn't have known that if I didn't buy it. I'm reading through it - or rather trying - because it's just so dense. It will in all seriousness require more notes than many college papers I've written. And, that isn't what bothers me. Gygax's prose has its charms and in the late seventies and early eighties I had a lot more time (being an adolescent with no responsibilities will do that for you). It's a product of the era after all.

No. What bothers me is that ANY modern adventure writing would follow that or even Keep on the Borderlands as a template. And, I say that with all love for Keep. Keep I've had for years and I have an almost intuitive index of its contents in my head at this point. But, I wanted to supplement that with the (in)famous Hommlet. **So, if anyone has a ""starting location"" sort of option that is written for actual use and play and not for Summer reading lists, or wants to share their own notes on Hommlet, I'm all ears.** I honestly don't know what I was expecting. I own G123 and D123. I know what Gygax's work typically looks and reads like. Nostalgia colored glasses get me again.

I'm reminded of why as a young DM I developed the ability to wing and improv as early as I did. It's because I wanted to run games not do homework. Anyway, end rant.

Edit: I appreciate most of you. I'll revisit it when I'm prepared to read Gygax rather than read a gameable product. It's really a testament to the quality of the phenomenon that was D&D that it survived the writing and edits of the day. Some of you though... have even more rose colored glasses than I have.

EDIT EDIT: Thanks for the support, folks. And the offers of notes, too! I'm going to complete this and I'll share my own notes; could be fun to compare notes and what different DMs took from the village! Hell, the process is part of the fun; it just isn't the fun I was expecting for some reason. I know it sounds like I'm talking smack about Gary, but I'm really not. His love of language was a HUGE influence on me and one of the things that kept me a voracious reader as a teenager. And, it's clear when you read anything he touched. But, we really can acknowledge that AND be critical. It's possible. If I can admit my own nostalgia goggles, so can you.

1gngool,Starting to rethink this whole OSR thing...,"Curious if anyone can relate.

So, I started out playing and then DMing 5e, as a lot of people do. I grew dissatisfied with 5e, so I looked around for alternatives. I discovered the OSR and dove into it, reading the blogs, watching the videos, and buying the games. I started up a Keep on the Borderlands Moldvay Basic game, though it's fizzled due to out of game reasons. I'm looking to start something up again, but I'm having second thoughts.

The games I tried to run with 5e are very different from the game I tried to run and the games I've considered running with B/X. I've been in the OSR sphere, so I've definitely absorbed a lot of old school sensibilities, but I'm starting to wonder if the OSR* is specifically right for me and my players. 

My players haven't shown a huge amount of interest in the ""dungeon crawl"" scene; especially since it's not really part of 5e or popular culture in general. I don't think they are into the idea of ""survival horror"" and going through many characters. I also think I might actually want something where characters can have more longevity and be involved in longterm storytelling. I know plenty of people have had incredible long term stories emerge from this style of play, but it seems like the high lethality would make this less common. I don't really think you can do something like Lord of the Rings with something like B/X. It wouldn't be the same if you had four consecutive fellowships, lol.

I'm not criticizing these games or the people who like them. I'm just rethinking whether it's right for me. I got sucked into the 5e scene, and then I got sucked into the OSR scene, so this is probably a me problem. 

I think I might want to features larger worlds than dungeons with more going on, with political machinations, travel, etc. (I'm not saying that cant be done with these games, but B/X and its derivations seem very specifically designed for the dungeon).

I guess I'm wondering what recommendations the community has. Would 2e give the things I originally sought from the OSR (higher danger level, role-playing rather than rollplaying, character discovery rather than character building, etc)? Is there some other OSR game that you'd recommend for the complete D&D experience, both below and aboveground?

I'm also wondering if there are any former 5e-ers that can relate to my experience here, as I'm sure I'm not that unique. 

Heck, I'm even wondering if 5e might be worth revisiting with OSR principles and features. There are a number of OSR things I know would have really improved 5e when I ran it (random encounters, reaction rolls, roleplay resolution instead of rolling, etc). But I'd probably end up stripping so much it wouldn't really be 5e anymore.

But yeah, I appreciate any comments and suggestions. 

EDIT: Maybe I didn't word my thoughts correctly. I don't want no dungeon crawling or lethality, but dungeon crawling plus other elements well-supported. Lethality-wise, I can't firmly say yet.

1irszg3,I really don't understand why Glumdark is on top of the Kickstarter charts right now. In defense of system-specific and offense of system-agnostic random tables.,">A massive, fully illustrated, painstakingly constructed resource for Game Masters and players of dark fantasy tabletop roleplaying games. Recommended for the likes of Mörk Borg but totally system agnostic and compatible with Shadowdark, Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, or any other TTRPG.

It claims to be system agnostic, which is theoretically true, however the reason why people play Shadowdark over Mörk Borg or Pathfinder over D&D is because these **systems are tools to tell particular type of fiction.**

For example, D&D 5e is largely a game about heroic roleplay where characters brave social, exploration and combat encounters with their bespoke talents. Therefore DMs will tend to run encounters that engage with the PCs character systems. Therefore to maximize fun in those systems, the GM needs to engage with those rules, or else the players end up with a whole bunch of buttons that do nothing.

And 5e, unbeknownst to most of you, I'm sure, has bespoke random tables!

|1d20|Situation|
|:-|:-|
|1|A dragon wyrmling has gathered a band of kobolds to help it amass a hoard.|
|2|Wererats living in a city's sewers plot to take control of the governing council.|
|3|Bandit activity signals efforts to revive an evil cult long ago driven from the region.|

A small snip of the DMG (please don't Pinkerton me, WotC). As you can see Adventure Starters in 5E do a couple things. They set up a situation where players solve a problem through any combination of social, combat encounters and a place to explore. This isn't random design, the table is written that way because of the way 5e, as a game, works. It also references settings and monsters, because those monsters aren't just statblocks, they mean things. Dragons and Kobolds have very distinct roles in the meta-setting of modern D&D.

The players are playing to achieve and overcome conflict.  
  
Mörk Borg is a rules light game driven largely by its setting, which is interlinked with its mechanics to create tone and atmosphere. Mörk Borg mechanics, despite being relatively rules-light, is inextricably linked with its setting. If you ignore The Calendar of Nechrubel, most of the other game elements fall flat. If the world doesn't end, what's the point of the Basilisks under Galgenbeck? If nobody believes the prophecies, then why is the world such a dark place? If characters aren't meant to be fairly disposable, then why do they die so quickly?

https://preview.redd.it/bgj2mfiyzqje1.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=06d4457949df9733bbf6a68216211a13dda82ef9

As you can see, the contents of the table are definitely not system or setting agnostic and build upon the Mörk Borg setting. They also don't seed for encounters, like most OSR games, it is leaving space for emergent storytelling. The players are playing to find out.

You see, while these tables are random, the content is still bespoke for the game and build upon its mechanics and tone.

But here is a Glumdark Table for Quest Seeds example:

1 You meet a hedge wizard who is the victim of a terrible curse. They want you to do some exploring for them. Head to the Covered Waterfall and see if you can find a rumored cache of goods.  
2 Guard the warden Oto Potocnik on their journey to the Blasted Ocean.  
3 The cleric Teja Pohl needs you to seize the Quill of Rats from the Roost of Contemplation.

1. You meet magical dude with nondescript condition. They want you to go dungeon crawl at nondescript place. The dungeon crawl has nondescript loot maybe.  
2. Escort a dude with interesting yet nondescript job title to evocatively named yet nondescript place.  
3. Dude with interesting job needs you to dungeon crawl to find evocatively named thing.

Like I am not crazy right, but running these in either 5E or MB seems very attractive. Evocatively named things have to be made up retroactively to fit the setting or content has to be added through GM fiat.

What difference does it make if I go to the Blasted Ocean over the Covered Waterfall? Neither these places are real or even loosely defined. There is no restriction, which could breed creativity.

Like random tables are fun tools because you point you into a direction, but rather Glumdark is just spits out a sequence of words you have to assign directions to.

https://preview.redd.it/zjoxbgqz5rje1.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba38a19343ef1e5f47b3555e42b42472bac75345

Like what do I do with this? Hello Player, you receive a grim bullwhip of throat-punching? What does it do? How does it relate to the world the rules have laid out? What makes it weird? How does that weirdness manifest mechanically?

At that point I am not consulting a random table, but just creating homebrew with a random dark sounding title, which doesn't make the DM's job any easier.

So honestly while it does seem nice that Glumdark is system-agnostic, I can't help but feel that they might have shot themselves in the foot by being too general and just end up with a ""grim fantasy wacky words"" table, rather than a helpful and opinionated tool for DMs.

1fzwk3q,Just a tale from my experience with old-school D&D,"After diving back into some old-school D&D (we're talking AD&D 1E and BX in my case), I can't help but feel like the magic of OSR isn't just nostalgia—it's the *simplicity* and sheer unpredictability that makes it a different beast. No skill checks for every tiny thing, no 300-page rulebook expansions—just you, your character, a rusty sword, and the DM's sadistic grin as you descend into a dungeon where everything *can* kill you (and probably will). 😈

There's something incredibly freeing about playing a game where survival is more about *player ingenuity* than just min-maxed stats. Modern D&D has its perks, but there's a thrill in knowing that a goblin with a pointy stick could end your character's journey faster than any dragon.

Also, the random tables... don't even get me started on the beauty of random encounters. You enter a room? BAM—you're in a pit of slime with an ancient cursed relic and no escape. You pick a lock? BOOM—turns out it's a mimic, and now you're fighting for your life. OSR keeps you on your toes in ways modern D&D just doesn't.

Anyone else feel like the OSR approach brings back that sense of danger and creativity that made early D&D so exciting? Sometimes, less really *is* more. Do you guys thinks it's even possible that modern D&D one day will get back to it's roots commercially speaking?

1gwgfa7,How I Prepped 16 Dolmenwood Factions for My Campaign (Blog Series),"Hi! I recently completed a deep dive into every faction in the upcoming [Dolmenwood setting](https://necroticgnome.com/pages/about-dolmenwood). Some factions were even split into sub-factions, bringing the total to 16 factions! In my blog series, I explore how I prepared each of them for my game.

Check out the full series here: [Dolmenwood Factions Index](https://elmc.at/dolmenwood-factions-index/).  

---

### What's This About?

This series is an exploration of faction prep for Dolmenwood, based on a [framework I wrote about earlier this year](https://elmc.at/how-to-set-up-and-use-faction-turns/). It's heavily inspired by *Mausritter* with additional ideas from *Cairn*.  

The goal? To create a **dynamic, evolving world** for your players to interact with.

---

### Posts Include:

- ⚠️ **Spoiler Alert!** ⚠️ (Players, beware: Dolmenwood content ahead!)  
- **Deep Dives:** Detailed breakdowns of goals, actions, and more.  
- **Fresh Content:** New NPCs and resources to enrich your world.  
- **Inspiration in Action:** Real gameplay notes and examples.  

---

### What's in Each Post?

Each post explores a Dolmenwood faction in detail, breaking it down into actionable parts. Here's what's included:

1. **Goals and Milestones:**
   Every faction has goals—either taken from the Dolmenwood books or created to fill gaps. I also outline potential milestones: events that might occur as goals progress. These are flexible ideas, not set in stone.

2. **Resources:**
   Resources define a faction's strength and influence. I assign each faction at least three unique resources, drawn from descriptions in the books or extrapolated. During the course of a campaign, a faction might gain more or lose resources.

3. **Actions and Agents:**
   Actions represent what the faction is actively working on, and I outline three for each faction. For clarity, I break them into smaller tasks with potential follow-ups to spark inspiration. Agents—NPCs leading these actions—give your players clear interaction points.

4. **Further Thoughts:**
   This section is where I speculate! I brainstorm additional actions, challenges the faction might face, and long-term plans. These musings provide even more hooks to expand their role in your game.

5. **Alliances:**
   No faction exists in isolation. I explore likely alliances—whether with other factions, Fairy nobles, or local groups. These relationships add complexity to the world and drive inter-faction dynamics.

6. **Examples from My Game:**
   To ground everything, I share examples from my own campaign. These include notes from five faction turns for each faction and insights into how the outcomes affected my players or the overall narrative as well as the standing of the faction generally.

> **Note**
>
> I take liberties with some of the factions, either due to missing details or to better fit the themes of my campaign. These examples are tailored for my game, but I hope they inspire your own setups. Feel free to adapt them, change them, or use them as they are—whatever works best for your table. If you're short on time, these setups can save some legwork. I hope this series provides useful insights and ideas for your Dolmenwood adventures!

### Why I Did This

This blog series was my passion project for the year. I started it to share my faction framework but didn't expect to dive so deep—or to cover all 16 factions! It's been a rewarding experience, and I hope it helps others bring their campaigns to life.

Thanks for reading!

1fk2xgd,What are your top 3 OSR games? (2024 update),"Two years ago there was a post here on the OSR subreddit with the exact same title as this one (sans parentheses).  Lots of people submitted three choices, which were compiled in a Google Doc.  The results, when ordered and ranked based on how often they were picked, gave a really interesting insight into the play culture here (you can find them linked at the bottom).

Well it's been (almost exactly) two years since that previous post.  Two years of an OGL scandal, a deluge of great new games, and the slow ever moving treads of play culture zeitgeist.  I would love to see what has changed since September 2022 and was hoping for responses to help recreate this poll:

**Can you denote your top three OSR TTRPGs?  They can be your ""Top""/""Favorite""/""Best"" (etc.) games for any reason.  Order doesn't matter, as each of your three submissions will be counted once.**

Here are my top three.

* Basic Fantasy
* Vaults of Vaarn
* Shadowdark

I will compile all the votes here into a Google Doc

1d7i471,Catacombs are Scarier Than You May Think.,"Many of us have sent our characters through tombs and catacombs to slay undead and plunder gold treasure. Mass burial sites are great. They're evocative, scary, and inspire heroism in the player characters. If we base our catacombs off of real world modules, they can be even greater.

The catacombs beneath Saint Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna is 2 floors deep, each 9 meters deep (27 feet deep). One wing of the first level holds a dozen coffins of the Dukes of Austria (including and unfortunate child-sized one), one room holds old and disrepaired statues, the rest of floor 1 and all of floor 2 are dedicated to the **11,000** people buried in a period of 40 years in the 1700s. Closed off rooms, windows showing mounds of bones floor to ceiling.

How does this apply to our OSR games? Well your basic skeleton gets pretty outclassed by midgame, so what if we put the players in an environment where they must fight thousands? An OSR-challenge would be ""how do we get the loot, while avoiding being mobbed by thousands of skeletons?""

 A straightforward solution to the ""weak skeleton"" problem would be by creating a ""bone swarm"" undead monster. An amalgamation of hundreds fractured souls and their bones, thrashing violently against the interlopers into their resting ground.

Most of our games exist in a pseudo-medieval period, as opposed to the enlightenment period the Vienna Catacombs were used by civilians. Solution: ancient fallen empire.

None of this is necessarily groundbreaking. The mains point is if you want to instill horror or inspire creativity in your players, don't populate your catacombs with a few dozen undead. Put a **few thousand** in there.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bc9e9e20>,osr,1717455335.0
1jcnc7i,In defense of Keep on The Borderlands (and also a defense of Humanoid enemies),"I came across a thread a few weeks ago and I’ve been ruminating on my thoughts for a while. The thread is locked so I couldn’t reply right then and there and I’m not sure where I even saw it or who this response is to but oh well, here I am.

 The main gist was “why run keep on the borderlands? It’s boring, none of the enemies are interesting and they don’t even name any of the NPC’s.” Other people replied but no answer was sufficient (in my or the OP’s opinion.) 
I believe that KOTB is the perfect module to get someone to DM. That was the main purpose in the first place. The area is quite large with a lot of interesting little areas and room for the DM to flex their creativity. It leaves quite a bit open to slot into any campaign.

Aside from the faction play that really makes the caves of chaos so fun, having humanoids be the first real enemies allows both the players and the DM to understand the motives, tactics and mindset of what you are fighting. Big pig face dude and sneaky little boys are much easier for someone new to both TTRPGs and fantasy as a whole to understand than say, a gibbering mouther or xorn. 

We’ve had decades upon decades of iterations on ttrpgs, lots of new creations and creativity on the scene and we are in an absolute deluge of new options. Why complain about the origins of the hobby?That’s where most of this started for a metric butt ton of people. Of course it’s tropey. It created the tropes! 

I guess I’m going to end this with a question. Other than time constraints, why does it seem like there are a lot of people who don’t understand that this is a game of imagination? Why are some people seemingly allergic to deviating from the books and making it their own? (And just to add some inflammatory statements, this question also goes for the Hispanic coded Orcs in the 5e art. If you don’t like it, don’t add it. You aren’t beholden to the creator’s vision because once the book is yours, it’s your book. You’re the creator now.)

EDIT: I’m not sure if it was even in this sub. It may have been in r/rpg. All I know is that it popped into my feed and I don’t have the knowledge or resources to find it again. But yes, there are people who don’t like kotb.

1jbcca3,Do you let the creator of a game influence whether or not you play/support it?,"I am an OD&D nerd and have enjoyed the recent publication from Wizards of the Coast about the original game. That sent me down a rabbit hole of retro-clones, I think they’re called. 

Al’Qadim was always my favorite 2nd Edition setting, so I was drawn to this obscure game I found called Seven Voyages of Zylarthen that is more swords and sandals than European fantasy. It reads like OD&D but, frankly, better in many respects. got some glowing reviews so I snagged it.

Yeah, it’s utterly brilliant. 

Unfortunately, I also found out in my wanderings that the creator is explicitly Islamophobic, or at least was when he was blogging many years ago. Seems like he has left the hobby. 

I want to champion a masterpiece of a game but struggle to separate art from artist, despite enjoying a game made by people as flawed and of their time as I certainly am in 2025. I also don’t want to attract the wrong kinds of people if I advertise games for it.

1cwr88m,I Ran the Tomb of Horrors and it Didn't Suck,"A bunch of my regular players weren't available for a session this week, so I finally had the chance to pull out a module that I've wanted to run for a while: The Tomb of Horrors!

You can read my full play report on [my blog](https://theundergroundlabyrinth.blogspot.com/2024/05/i-ran-tomb-of-horrorsand-it-didnt-suck.html) if you're interested. I refer to rooms throughout by number more than description though (I wanted to avoid too many spoilers) so it might be handy to have a map of the place as you read along.

But here's a super brief summary for those who don't want to read the whole thing:

I took the 20 pregens in the back of the module and converted them into OSE characters. Then I ran the tomb as an OSE one-shot where players would pick new characters up as the old ones died off. The group did really well and we started off strong! They fell victim to some of the early traps, and expertly defeated many of the others. But a lack of direction and some foolish decisions on my part caused the middle of the game to stall. Things picked back up at the end though when the players decided to throw caution to the wind and speed-run the rest of the dungeon. Overall consensus: we had fun on a Saturday night. And that's a win in my book.

Honestly, I think the truth of the tomb is that it's alright. It isn't one of the greatest dungeons of all time IMO, but it also isn't unplayable trash. It's one of those dungeons that I think can really shine if you put some elbow grease into it, and run it for your group as a novelty. But that means that I'd only recommend it for experienced game masters. Running the dungeon strictly as written risks some severe pacing problems. But I think those pacing problems can be overcome.

In the future, I'll probably write up some kind of guide or post with ways that I would tune the adventure slightly to even out the pacing issues that I had. And I'm excited to run it again in the future and really refine the experience.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bcbef860>,osr,1716241152.0
1eq273k,Vermis text-game update 4.1! ,"Hey guys, got another update here. I hope you all are enjoying these regular updates on the subreddit.

***You can play the game*** [here](https://duehringadam.itch.io/vermis)

A common pain point I have noticed with a lot of players is that when they discovered a secret path it was frustrating and obtuse to actually go on that secret path, so I have added a system when you discover a secret path, it will append the secret path to the visible exits on the player UI.

I added a journal function, so when you inspect important things, defeat important enemies, or enter notable areas, you should get a journal entry with tidbits of lore!

Started work on the Flutewood forest area, it is unfinished but there is one boss enemy to fight, and a journal to discover.

Added an option to disable the CRT effect in the settings tab.

The moving statues are now in the catacombs but they do not follow you.

Currently working on a system for when you interact with NPCs, some of them will give you an item once dialogue is finished, for now with the Drowsy Knight, you can give him the Thousand Eyes ring to receive the night watch mushrooms, you can also kill him for more! You can also give the thousand eyes to the lonely knight, if it doesn't work let me know!

Should hopefully have fixed some bugs regarding starting items being equipped on start.

Fixed a lot of other various bugs, hopefully!

Ever since I've gotten into the OSR ""philoshopy/ethos"" of play over the last few years, I've come to HEAVILY prefer randomization.

I have great interest in Buddhism and gnostic, meditative traditions and a through-line in many of these spiritual paths is that the greatest thing you can do is to remove your ""self"" from the equation of reality and let reality exist on its own terms... this creates the truest (not necessarily the best) outcomes and leads often to the most honest art.

I see this echoed in the OSR to such a potent extent and it fits so perfectly with my philosophy on art and life.

charts for wilderness discoveries, random encounters, monster reactions, loot tables, etc... create a world from what the dice tell you, from what reality tells you!  remove your ""self"" from the equation and see what the world creates for you.

The OSR and OSE especially facilitate this type of play (imo) greater than any other system.

I am pleased to announce the publication of **A Voyage to Fomalhaut**, a 48-page setting primer, and the 100th EMDT release. This guide is suitable for both players and GMs, and presents a setting with strong sword & sorcery and sword & planet influences. The guide updates and expands on the 2008 writeup in **Fight On!** magazine #03, reflecting the one and a half decade of gaming that has taken place in the setting since that point.

*“Fomalhaut is a world whose origins coincide with the discussions that formed the modern understanding of old-school gaming in the mid-2000. Inspired by the rediscovery of Judges Guild (particularly Wilderlands of High Fantasy), the “Appendix N” books, and the stranger aspects of old-school play, it is a distillation of influences that make these games distinct and powerful.*

*This is a setting of bold sword & sorcery, where the Techno-Hellenic age fell in destructive interstellar wars, and was succeeded by one of iron and bronze. Here, the descendants of Man have fractured into a myriad strange societies in a changed world, some warlike, some reclusive, and some surprisingly civilised. Philosophy, religion, and cultural variety are rife with exception and local colour. But “in every age, in every place, the deeds of men remain the same” – and for all its strangeness, this setting, and the adventures you can find therein, should be immediately recognisable to fans of sword & sorcery adventure.*

*And where adventures are concerned, Fomalhaut can offer them in abundance: in barren wastelands dotted with the remnants of fallen empires, on wine-dark seas where splendid isles and reclusive civilisations await, in teeming cities where life is cheap and the sword can gain what even money cannot buy, deep underground in forgotten vaults and subterranean lands; and perhaps even beyond – in strange dimensions and the domains of mirages and dreams. Men of many devices shall win it all, while those who shrink back shall be forever forgotten!”*

More detailed setting information and a preview of the deities section is found in [this post](https://beyondfomalhaut.blogspot.com/2024/12/blog-towards-fomalhaut-and-what-it-is.html).

The booklet includes the following materials:

* An introduction to the setting 4000 years after its foundation by a starfaring civilisation, and some 3200 after this civilisation’s downfall.
* A writeup of Fomalhaut’s gods and ideologies, and the practices of worship for Clerics, divine champions dedicated to a god’s cause, as well as laymen. 28 deities are discussed from Kang the Thousand-Eyed, rapacious God of Adventurers; and Mereskan the Bat-God, patron of thieves; to the Followers of the LOGOS, a sect of philosophers dedicated to the arts of mathematics and geometry; and the Idolators of Dhakam, a barbarous cult worshipping crumbling idols in the wastelands.
* A description of Fomalhaut’s regions, with its colourful mosaic of civilisations. Visit the ruined landscape of the Worn Lands, discover the mysteries of the Plateau of Ong whose cruel monks allow no stranger intruding on their domain to live, and sail seas hiding fantastic islands and fallen utopias.
* A brief guide to adventuring in the setting, with its people – from the mammoth-hunting cavemen of the northern ice wastes to the decadent descendants of the Empire of Mung, masters of ancient technologies.
* A two-sided setting overview map, with one side drawn by Sean Stone.

**A Voyage to Fomalhaut** features cover art by Peter Mullen, and interiors by Cameron Hawkey, Graphite Prime, and various Golden Age illustrators (including some by the incomparable Virginia Frances Sterrett). The print version of the supplement is available from my [**Bigcartel store**](https://emdt.bigcartel.com/); the PDF edition will be published through DriveThruRPG with a few months’ delay.

First things first: I wanna express how amazing it is that so many people have tried out my game, I am incredibly grateful to all of you who played, and another thanks to those who left feedback either here or on the [itch.io](http://itch.io) game!  


Scope of the game is increasing with adding these new systems, which means it will take longer in the future to push out updates, which hopefully won't be too long between, remember: I am doing it alone!  


I noticed people were having a lot of trouble with how specific the old command processor was and how it wasn't very contextual. I took it upon myself to write a new one from scratch and it should be super flexible and have context based on whats happening in the game. If you find any bugs with it, make sure to let me know!

>How it should function is that no matter how many words you type it will parse your commands (to a reasonable extent).  
this would function like this 

>go to the freaking left idiot computer  
You go left!

I've been laying the groundwork for a leveling system and part of that groundwork is items that have certain stat requirements, don't be surprised if you pick up an item and you cant wear it! In a future update you should be able to level up.

I've been thinking about the scope of the game, and what a game requires versus what the Vermis guide provides, I am on the fence about only putting things in the game that the artbook had, or adding in my own to fill in some gaps. I've done a bit of both but I really want feedback on this one!

Please, if would be kind enough to take the time to fill out this response sheet: [https://forms.gle/UhPouKpB886yYjgT8](https://forms.gle/UhPouKpB886yYjgT8)",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bcd58d70>,osr,1722484975.0
1fl3n6n,The new rule on AI content is not clear at all,"As the title says, this is a half-baked rule that was frankly not thought through in its current form.

For example, Heroes of Adventure is a system that was getting some notice on here a while back. That system's art is (I believe entirely) AI-generated. Is all discussion of Heroes of Adventure now banned on here? If a link to Heroes of Adventure content is posted on here and it shows some of the art, will that get the poster banned? Is discussion of Heroes of Adventure's aesthetic banned? Only if someone links to some of the art as an example? Unclear.

What about products that use some AI art here and there, but are mostly not AI-generated? Allowed for discussion? Linking? Does it make a difference whether or not the cover art is AI?

If an online sandbox generator uses some kind of machine learning, is that banned? Are we banned from linking to it? From posting results it generates?

I'm not particularly attached to AI art, and I certainly don't want the sub to get clogged with AI spam. Some of my favorite creators absolutely despise it (e.g. David McGrogan).

But I don't think my preferences should control what other people are allowed to post, and I don't understand why the mods skipped over the intermediate position of simply requiring all AI content to be clearly tagged so that those who want to downvote can do so.

These are the kinds of problems you run into when you rush out a rule in a fit of indignation with no meaningful discussion, while most of your community is asleep. I don't care to see AI-generated art. But this seems like yet another step in the direction of running this subreddit in an autocratic manner, where the mods impose their judgments and preferences from on high, instead of letting the voting system do its job and express the will of the community. And I really don't care to see that.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bce52a20>,osr,1726805761.0

1gqqwsb,Will gonzo high-level play ever make its way into the modern OSR scene?,"The recent thread comparing 5E unfavourably for its overpowered PCs got me thinking about how selective the OSR movement is about approaches to play in the early D&D scene. You just have to flip through something like the original Rogue’s Gallery to see high-powered, gonzo PCs drawn the real games of TSR’s stable of writers and their friends.

Nothing captures the gonzo high-level play of yore like the Day of the Dwarf, an actual play account by TSR designer Roger Moore, published in Dungeon magazine issue 42 (Oct 1980):

>“We were setting up for one of our high level adventures; there was a rumour in the area where we lived of a new monster lair, in the Firefall Mountains to the West, that held unparalleled treasures. We had most of the known artifacts, but this sounded like something different. We agreed it was going to be worth a try.

>”It was going to be too unwieldy to bring all of our henchmen, hirelings, and armies, so each of us brought only our main player-character, steed, and familiars as required. Joanna brought her Paladin lady and her horse with the mithril barding, and managed to get special dispensation from her church (The First Temple of Wonder Woman) to bring all seven of her holy swords. Alan took his storm giant and mattock of the titans, and led the party alongside Jerry’s golden dragon character. Jerry griped a lot because he couldn’t take Farah, Kate, and Jacqueline, his henchdragons, but Dan had been firm. Belinda got her brownie, her homonculous, and her two golf bag full of wands, staves, rods, an scepters, and saddled up her unicorn, riding beside George’s arch-Druid/Bard, and Isaac’s eleven Ranger/Cleric/Magic-User with the mutant horse (he called it Bruce or something) he’d gotten on another plane. I took out my caveman and +5 vorpal battleaxe, and became the rear-guard. Above us flew Margie and her pegasus, serving as air cover and emergency medic (16th level clerics are much appreciated in our group). Margie worked as a nurse in the hospital downtown, and she fit the role of cleric well. Before setting out, we agreed as a group to hold down psionics and we swore not to summon any gods into the adventure; we’d been quested so many times that we know the Abyss like the back of our hands.”

I’m curious if this approach to D&D will ever be revived by the OSR scene, or if the OSR brand and ethos are too firmly wedded to low-level, lower-powered play.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bce7e4e0>,osr,1731540681.0

1j5k9f6,"[PSA] Massive print cost increase coming to DriveThruRPG effective April 1, 2025","[DriveThruRPG](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/browse?ffiliate_id=2150725) and associated sites will soon increase cost of print-on-demand products from 10% to 80%, depending on print binding and location:

**EDIT: UPDATED ANNOUNCEMENT**

***Upcoming Print-on-Demand Book Price Changes – Effective April 1, 2025***

*We always want to keep print costs as low as possible, and it has been years since we passed any price increases through to our publishing partners.*

*However, our print supplier, Lightning Source/Ingram, has announced a price adjustment starting April 1, 2025, that will be reflected on DriveThru sites.*

***Key Changes***

* _Due to increasing supply costs in the US, **Black & White print costs in the US will increase significantly**, from around 20% for low-pagecount hardcover titles up to about 50% or slightly more for large hardcover books, and with softcover titles seeing an even greater increase._
* _**UK print costs for Black & White books will also increase**, but generally only by 3-4%._
* _**Standard Color print costs will increase**, by roughly 12-13% for US printing but only around 3% for UK printing._
* _On the whole, **Premium Color print costs will decrease slightly for US printing but increase slightly for UK printing.**_
     * _Example 1: A 180-page large premium hardcover currently costs $32.10 to print in the US; after April 1, that same title will drop to $27.80._
     * _Example 2: In the UK, the same 180-page book currently costs £20.23, which will increase to £20.93 starting in April._

Above will most likely lead to publishers increasing prices on the books, especially those who use at-cost pricing. I ordered all hardbacks from my wish-list, just in case. :)

1euwetl,Shields will be splintered ,"So I found a rule a while ago that said something along the lines of if your character has a shield then that player could choose to have their shield destroyed by in incoming attack to have that attack do no damage. 

I started using it and low level fighters and clerics now have at least 2 good hits in them (exactly 2 since I use a hd system) and I just thought I’d ask if anyone else using a similar ruling for their games?

Maybe it will get old fast? I can see why they used to hire a kid to haul all your crap around….",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bcf70890>,osr,1723941014.0
1dlhihv,Players find it more profitable to hunt other parties than to go deeper in the dungeon,"I'm running a mega-dungeon (my Dungeon23 project) with WWN where multiple parties share a camp outside the dungeon. XP is awarded based on any recovered loot's value in silver. Recently, my players wiped out an entire adventuring party, except one survivor who escaped. The looted gear, mainly armor, was quite valuable. Now, my players prefer hunting other adventuring parties over exploring deeper levels of the dungeon.

I've heard that ""players will optimize the fun out of a game,"" and personally I think going deeper is much more fun than hunting other parties on the early levels. Plus, the survivor's return to camp will likely prompt other parties to make some strong counter attacks.

Do you have any fun ideas for how the other parties might respond? Just some ideas of my own:

* The rivals start forming larger teams
* They search for other dungeon entrances to avoid my party (kind of boring perhaps)
* They place a bounty on my party's heads",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bcfa79e0>,osr,1719011716.0
1cdpf6b,Rime of the Frostmaiden is the one 5e adventure worth using,"I know this might feel like sacrilege to suggest a mainstream 5e adventure, but I ran Rime of the Frostmaiden a while back and imho it allowed for, even encouraged, an old-school style of play. I think it’s the best toolkit adventure that WOTC has put out in recent years. I ran this in 5e and there were still multiple PC deaths (and could have easily been about 6 more).

PROS 

* point-crawl sandbox 
* 10 starting villages with maps, NPCs, local factions, and quests 
* \~two dozen mini-dungeons to drop into your game (or replace with your own) 
* fun factions with conflicting goals that allow players to make allies and enemies 
* Wilderness encounters are decent and some of the locations in this section are ones I will drop into games for years. 
* Deadly. 
* Plenty of drag and drop content like: a fallen magi-tech city, a duergar fortress dungeon, panopticon prison, mountainside goblin fort, crashed spelljammer, and more. 
* Arctic DnD is badass. 
* Can easily pivot the adventure into a new direction by emphasizing certain locations/factions over others. Examples: aliens in the arctic, underdark invasion, witches & cults infiltrating rural towns, wrath of a winter goddess, etc.

CONS 

* The sandbox narrows to a linear plot in the later chapters (but you could completely ignore that) 
* WOTC layout. They don't build their books for ease of use at the table, but the first couple chapters are better laid out than the last few (meh). 
* The ""endings"" that they planned for/expected are disorganized. 
* The motivation of the BBEG is not clearly stated. 
* 5e vanilla fantasy aesthetic (I pushed it toward grittier low-fantasy)

This was one of the most fun campaigns my table ever played. My players enjoy both old-school play and “big damn quest” style games, but this played like an old school game more than any other 5e content we have used.

I go first.

Players double back (yes, double back!) to one of the first dungeons they explored in the campaign for story/macguffin reasons.  Perhaps they missed something to stop the manticore?  As they cautiously explore, they begin to remember and piece together the terrible events that drove them from the place.  

At one point a player recalls that there was a pit trap where one of their characters fell and died during the rout.  With maps they made before, they successfully find the corpse, use their equipment (equipment!) to lower themselves into the pit trap and discover his rotting corpse, as well as 400 gold pieces!  Cha-ching. 

But as they collect the gold and move on in the darkness to find the gem of power, the corpse of their fallen comrade begins to stir, reawakened by the disturbance and the presence of powerful ancient magic...

So, no combat here. Just tense, grim-dark exploration vibes, and player-driven emergent storytelling.

1dlxqh3,B/X is Deadly,"Every couple months while I am working on my own material I pull out Keep on the Borderlands, to me it is the North Star of adventure design. Less than 30 pages include the rules (4 pages), town (5.5 pages), wilderness (1.5 pages), maps & resources (11 pages including the slip cover), & the dungeon (10 pages for 64 rooms).

Now, every time I read it (countless times) or run it (6+) something new sticks out that makes me pause. Last time I made a post similar to this it was Gygax indicating that you should just GIVE the players some healing potions and a magic dagger to start!

This time the passage that gave me pause is on page 14 (which actually has a ton of great advice - literally the prototype of ""The Monsters Know What They're Doing""):

""Ransoming Prisoners: Organized tribes can optionally be allowed to take player characters prisoner, freeing one to return to the KEEP in order to bring a ransom back to free the captives. Set the sums low - 10 to 100 gold pieces (or a magic item which the ransoming monsters would fine useful) per prisoner. If the ransom is paid, allow the characters to go free. Then, without telling the players, assume that this success brought fame to the capturing monsters, so their numbers will be increased by 2-12 additional members, and the tribe will also be very careful to watch for a return of the adventurers seeking revenge for their humiliating captivity. The period of extra alertness will last 1-4 weeks; the increase in numbers is permanent.""

It is another fascinating look at what it meant to ""die"" in old school D&D and strongly ties into the pulp fantasy roots of the hobby where heroes weren't killed outright, they were captured, humiliated, and then came back seeking revenge.

So ask yourself, how deadly is old school D&D? What if death isn't actually the end of a character, it's just part of the gameplay loop? Especially with flatter power curves, stripping a fighter of their gear or a magic user of their spell books is tantamount to deleveling them significantly - and for many players a fate worse than death.

  
**Edit**: I changed the first paragraph which originally read ""Every couple months while I am working on my own material I pull out Keep on the Borderlands. **I know that it is in vogue to trash talk it, but to** me it is the North Star of adventure design.""

Whether or not KotBL is beloved wasn't really the point of the post or the topic I was trying to promote, but since it is what got latched onto I wanted to make the edit explicitly clear to provide context to the top comments.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd08fb00>,osr,1719068839.0

1hb5j0c,Blogging about low fantasy settings,"I've created a blog about running games in a low fantasy setting. 

My particular interest is in creating a human centric fairy-tale type vibe where even first level spells can seem powerful compared to everyday folk magic, monsters are rare, and the world feels more like our own than an alien planet.

Although my goals are a little extreme, some of it might be useful to consider even when creating a standard old school campaign.

1e2h9c0,"Our OSR Experience, 16 Months In: Part I","I've seen some posts on here where people have discussed how they got into the OSR scene and their subsequent experiences.  I personally found them really fascinating and informative, so I wanted to share my experience too.

**This will be long, like really long, so I know many won't want to read this all, and that's okay.**  This will be sort of a combination of a ""play report"" and ""running the game"" type post, along with a general story about how a bunch of people who started playing back in 3.5 Ed, along with some TTRPG newbies ended up, we think, capturing lightning in a bottle by exploring new systems and tailoring them a bit to suit our exact preferences, (consider this paragraph to be your TL;DR).

I titled it ""Part I"" because I wanted to focus on our journey into the OSR and how our game is going with this post.  I want to save the worldbuilding / playstyle stuff for Part II (if people are interested) as we now have multiple parties running around in a shared persistent world with ""strict timekeeping"" with just under 20 regular players total across a few tables, and I feel that should be a separate post.  Though this post will focus on the original group of players that started it all.

*Skip the first two paragraphs below this if background info doesn't interest you.*

For some background: most of us, me included, are mid-30s millennials who started playing TTRPGs and DMing them right around the time 3.5 Ed was new as freshmen/sophomores in high school.  Rapidly, many of us got into White Wolf and other systems (including non-TTRPGs too, like Warhammer, board games, LARPs and more).  Several of us played/ran games 3+ days a week during undergrad in the late 2000s.  Me in particular, I tried to get into 5th Ed, and found a lot that I liked with that edition (backgrounds, in particular, and the various sub-class builds I found awesome).  But for whatever reason, the overall game just didn't click with me, and for the first time I felt no desire to run a game.  So instead, I took a 6-ish year hiatus from TTRPGs to focus on career and grad school stuff.

COVID hits, gaming stops (save an online Starfinder game I played in, which rapidly ~~deteriorated~~ evolved into Futurama meets Spaceballs on acid, it was great). But then, in 2020/2021, I came across a KS for OSE: AF, and I backed everything, ordering Classic Fantasy as well.  When I finally had them all, I read everything nearly cover to cover.  Multiple times for certain sections (race-as-class was so confusing to me at first).  I discover this subreddit, I read all of the primers for old-school gaming, I watch interviews and some actual-plays from a bunch of different YT channels, I discover Questing Beast's channel, I scour forums to learn more about the style, you get the idea.

I start dusting off my homebrew world that I've been toying with since \~2012, and in winter/spring 2023, I decide to run a strictly RAW OSE: Classic Fantasy 2-3 shot game to learn the system, using The Hole in the Oak.  The party consisted of 5 players, most of whom have played tons of different TTRPGs, but not really anything in the OSR space.

In short, we overall had a great time.  We really liked the minimal feeling of separation between the player and the PC which allowed for easy immersion, as well as the flexibility provided by a light rules set, and to us, how it allowed for greater narrative creativity for both players and DM.  The speed of getting characters to the table and how easily situations in-game could be adjudicated were other strong selling points to us, as many of us had grown tired of rules-lawyering, or of pausing the action for 10 minutes to look up some esoteric rule published on WoTC's website back in 2005 and now only available on the internet archive.

Another major pro was the assumed playstyle, namely the lack of balanced encounters, which they felt made the game more alive and realistic by weaving a strong sense of danger...which goes back to that feeling of immersion.  Gold=XP, at first, seemed strange to us all, but once we all understood that ""outsmarting the evil ogre and stealing his gems"" yields basically the same XP as ""risking your lives to try to fight the evil ogre in order to take his gems,"" we understood it better.  And it provided a major disincentive to act like murder-hobos, which was important to me, as I'd grown tired of the ""let's just fight everything"" mentality.

The lower PC power levels and general de-emphasis on ""build optimization"" were well-received too, they said it made the characters more relatable at low levels, and gave a strong sense of accomplishment when they overcame stronger foes and made it back to safety with captured treasure.  ""I can't relate to being a superhero, I don't know how to roleplay that, but I can easily imagine having imposter syndrome and being unsure of my own abilities in a scary world"" is one thing that a player said that stuck with me.

A few things initially were counterintuitive until they started to click, like ""roll under"" ability checks and the dreaded THAC0, but for the most part we got used to it all by a few sessions in.  Same goes for the ""lack of unified mechanics"" as provided by the % chance for thief skills, X-in-6 chances for certain things, and d20 for others, all were a bit of a learning curve, but we soon found it fun, unique, and even somewhat charming.

Now, what a few of us didn't like about OSE: Classic Fantasy (at the time) were race-as-class, the lack of additional character customization options, race-based level caps, and the age-old ""thief skills are confusing, if they can hide does that mean the rest of us can't?"" type stuff (we did deeper research and sorted that one out, thanks to this subreddit actually).

For another example, while they liked the idea of retainers/hirelings for general labor and guarding their camp, they didn't like the idea of sharing XP with them, nor having them in dungeons, and they didn't want to do a ton of roleplay with them, which honestly, was all fine with me.    
  
But, regarding our first impressions on the OSR, the important takeaway here is this: we thought the style of play and overall rules set had a ton of potential which was absolutely worth exploring, we just knew we had to mold it a bit to suit our preferences.

So we decided to start another game, this time with OSE: AF, plus Secondary Skills, and a handful of house-rules that were custom tailored for our desired playstyle (max HP at first level; 3d6 down the line became 3d6 then allocate as desired; we used variable weapon damage; we brought in a few of the more ""traditional"" extra races/classes from Carcass Crawler; no ""slow"" weapons; 3d6's DTL's Feats of Exploration for additional XP; we introduced ability score progression as per D&D 3.5, so +1 to one ability score every 4th level; plus a few others).  Another player (with essentially zero TTRPG experience) joins us, bringing it to 6 players plus DM.  One player chose ""cartographer"" for their secondary skill, and became our dungeon mapper, using a notebook of graphing paper that I provided.  We assign out Caller and Quartermaster roles too.

The game's an open world sandbox set in my homebrew world, to which I dropped in a *heavily* edited Wormskin-era Dolmenwood as a geographic area, not as a rule set, (conveniently, I knew exactly where a ""weird, fae-touched woodland"" zone was in the world, I just never fleshed it out, but Gavin it seems did that for me, though I do also pull in stuff from the Dolmenwood books that I backed already too, so it's not \*just\* Wormskin, more on that in Part II).

The party has a blast, and immediately they're running around the region, befriending important NPCs, discovering points of interest, going on missions, and interacting with the world in tons of unique ways.  OSE: AF plus a few house rules was the perfect solution for us, and we found that tweaking BX to suit the desires of a table was easy, intuitive, and hard to ""break.""

Collaborative worldbuilding emerges as players flesh out regions of the world through both gameplay and backstories (i.e. the Wood Elf players develop a story about their homeland being destroyed prior to the start of the game, the Dwarf players all leave their mountain kingdom because ""something started feeling off back home,"" tons of adventure seeds to work with).

Meanwhile, I had no intricate long term plan for the game, no overarching narrative story that I was going to force on them, leaving everything up to player-led action to decide what direction the game went in.  I did have factions and moving pieces in the background and things happening, but the players had to interact with the world to learn about and affect those things.  And they loved it, more than I ever could have imagined.  They felt like they were autonomous individuals in a living fantasy world as opposed to characters in someone else's pre-planned story (paraphrasing their words, not mine, and I credit them with that, not myself, as they're the ones leading the action).  In short, the game feels like its running itself, at times.

Some relatives (zero TTRPG experience) come to visit, and they join us for a few sessions last summer, where we ran a slightly tweaked Winter's Daughter as a one-shot with 8 players, followed by another short adventure (Tannic).  They pick up the game rather quickly, finding it relatively easy to learn and immediately jumping into roleplay.

At the time, that was the most fun I'd ever had running a game before.  The players were super engaged, they overcame obstacles through roleplay and clever thinking, and took literal pages of notes on what they encountered.  They rapidly learned that very often ""the answer isn't on your character sheet"" and started applying various problem solving methods to in-game situations via outside the box thinking.  They also learned that simply trying to attack everything would lead to PC death.  And combat with 8 PC's at the table was still faster than 3.5 Ed with 3-4 players (I say that as someone who still has a soft spot for that system, I'm certainly not bashing it, or any other system for that matter).

This will be covered more in the Part II of this post, but my relatives return back home around the time that more friends become interested in old school gaming.  So earlier this year I start a second game, online, and get my relatives back into the game with their same characters, along with about 10 other players for an open table campaign centered around a modified and hugely expanded Keep on the Borderlands sandbox that I placed beyond the western border of Dolmenwood.  And that's going strong now too, with crossover between the parties here and there.

The in-person game continues, and the party runs through modified versions of The Incandescent Grottoes and other adventures, some from the TSR era, all tailored in various ways, plus some homebrew adventures.  We bring in the travel/camping/hex-crawling mechanics from the Dolmenwood books, and the party spends entire sessions just exploring areas of interest, and the party cartographer starts documenting what they find in each hex, making notes such as ""we're probably not ready for whatever we heard roaring in that cave, we should come back later.""

The roleplay gets dialed up to 11, with each character having such a distinct personality that they sometimes find themselves at odds with each other over how to proceed in a given situation, and they resolve it all in character, sometimes with actual yelling.  I've never seen roleplay so animated outside of a LARP environment, ever, and during college I played at a table with a couple of theatre majors, for what it's worth.

At present, we're all still truly having a blast with the game, it keeps our attention even during 9-10 hour marathon sessions, and we're always wanting to play more than our schedules permit.

We're thinking that with the present party alone, we have another 1-2 years of gameplay left, with their goal being to reach Domain level play, for which several of them are already laying the early groundwork.  We haven't ruled out utilizing Marsh's Companion book when it comes out either, and/or using BECMI as something of a template for higher level progression.  Or, doing some geo-political domain level stuff with the current PC's and switching back and forth between that and playing fresh level 1 PC's who are associated with the others, (i.e. a new level 1 MU is a pupil of the current party's arcanist once they have their wizard tower, stuff like that).

Our D&D group chat is constantly booming, both with game related discussions as well as unrelated stuff, and each player has a list of things that they still want to do in-game.  People bring up the game during parties unprompted, folks who play in one game talk to players from the other to exchange information (we have an in-character means of accomplishing this too).

Part of me wishes that we discovered old school play much earlier, as this is honestly the type of experience I've been looking for since the early 2000s when I first started out.  But at the same time, I think that our prior gaming experiences helped inform us of our likes and dislikes, and set us up better for the present game.

We're having so much fun, and I just had to share this with all of you, because I didn't know who else to talk to about this!

(If there's interest, I'll continue this in Part II sometime in the next week, where I'll talk about collaborative worldbuilding, running multiple games in a shared world, timekeeping, verisimilitude, factions, and more)

1ib7t7u,I Have To Advertise B/X as a JRPG,"'I Have to Advertise My OSE Game as a JRPG or: How I Learned to Love The Displacement of Traditional Western Fantasy'

Or something

Tldr: Is Japanese fantasy currently more OSR than Western fantasy?

I live in a very rural and sparsely populated area. Everyone who I can get in touch with who wants to play a tabletop game only wants to do 5e. Other systems simply don't exist locally. 

Well, I'm trying to change that. Advertising online for a rather small-medium (under 10 sessions) in-person 'dnd' campaign, using Black Wyrm of Brandonsford for OSE at my tiny local game store. Nothing super crazy or big additions, just semi RAW B/X Basic with some light touches. Milqutoast as it gets.

So people come to inquire, ""Can I play homebrew classes?"" ""What races do you allow?"" ""Here's my character concept"" ""This is for 5e?"" 

I look at it all and try to approximate the best response to these Gen Z hotshots. 

""So Dungeon Meshi, right? And Berserk? Okay, now combine those two."" - ""Ohhhhh. I get it. Sure."" 

I only have passing familiarity with both of those IPs. I'm not super keen on Japanese fantasy media. I played Final Fantasy 10 when I was, well, 10. 

And yet somehow, it clicks that the best way I can explain in an elevator pitch what the concept of B/X is, is not any comparisons to Lord of the Rings (not actually that many young people have seen or read it) or Conan the Barbarian or even just describing a trimmed down 5th Edition Forgotten Realms or even Baldurs Gate. 

I now have to categorize and appeal to Japanese fantasy media to justify not playing 5e.

And then it clicks again; is it just me or does the current generation (or perhaps fixation) of Japanese Fantasy in video games, manga and anime resemble and in media, preserve, OSR and post-OSR (or just Gygaxian fantasy) concepts more than most modern Western fantasy iterations? I could go on and on, but I think you might get the point. 

Im not a JRPG or Japanese-Western fantasy afficionado, so feel free to correct me if I misunderstand or misworded specific ideas. 

What do you think? I'm genuinely curious to hear what people observe on the matter. Have you experienced anything similar? ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd0dd160>,osr,1737981273.0

1blkaxq,Gary Con: Day two. Because people really seemed to like yesterday's recap.,"Snow in Lake Geneva! I was over the moon. It's been an unseasonably warm and dry winter in Seattle and I was worried I would have to wait until next year for the white stuff. This little dusting was perfect. Just substantial enough to add atmosphere without snarling up the roads.

After this miracle, a second: The late Jim Ward's good friend Harold ""Wisconsin"" Johnson, known for Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan and others, stepped up to run his planned Metamorphosis Alpha game. Frankly, I can't think of a better tribute.

There were many more fateful meetings. Matt Finch and Suzy Moseby of Mythmere Games surprised me in the halls, as last I heard they wouldn't be able to make it. Turns out some badges became available at the last minute. Wonderful people always.

There was Harold Johnson as mentioned, of course.

Steve Sullivan, who told me about a Manos: Hands of Fate game he'll be releasing soon. This guy gets me. Now I know there's at least one other person into D&D and Manos memorabilia.

Mike Carr and I talked about how his air combat rules from Dawn Patrol/Fight in the Skies made it into D&D and how his innovation of persistent pilot avatars foreshadowed D&D's leveling system.

Chatted for a sec with Daniel from the Bandit's Keep YouTube channel chilling by the bar fireplace.

Jeff Grubb, who teased me a little for bringing some Marvel stuff for him to sign, as he's local and already knows me. ""Why didn't you just ask me to lunch?"" In all fairness, cover artist Jeff Butler was there, too, so I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone this way. I also got a sweet Lugosi Dracula portrait from Jeff B. His whole Universal monsters series is great.

Ran into Vince Vaugh, the movie actor, of all people. He's not a guest or anything. I guess he just came to play. Dude's hella tall, which I did not expect.

Allan Hammack was kind enough to listen to me recap my relatively recent first playthrough of Ghost Tower of Inverness. My thief almost made it, only to get blasted by the Soul Gem.

Dave ""Zeb"" Cook seemed like a nice guy. We didn't talk long, but I did get to point out that his shoe was untied. A hero's work is never done.

Merle ""The Administrator"" Rasmussen really rocked his Bond tuxedo. I have to appreciate his commitment to the bit. Looking forward to playing in his Top Secret game Sunday morning.

Pat Kilbane, also hella tall, was kind enough to sign my copy of the documentary he just put out, the Dreams in Gary's Basement.

The last major event of the day was a foray into the mother of all dungeons, Blackmoor Castle, as refereed by original Blackmoor player and current campaign head, Bob Meyer. He set us on a chaotic (yet successful!) quest to retrieve the Wizard of the Wood's missing apprentice and some magic well water from the orc, troll, and balrog-infested maze. What a ride! And what a challenge to map, I might add! Cartographic crises aside, the game was a lot of fun. In true Blackmoor tradition, we threw 2d6 for most everything and none of us knew our characters' stats. One interesting twist is that we were all told to pick one special skill or power, which could be anything we could imagine. I chose uncanny luck, another player picked marksmanship, a third brawling, and so on. One guy even tried to make the going easier by saying his character had a knack for making a torch out of anything. With the main raw material on hand being dead orcs, the ""pork torch"" was born. At the end of the session, we returned triumphant and Bob had a photographer come in and take a proper group portrait with a professional camera that we then all got free physical copies of. What a class act! You know that's going on the wall.

Well, I've rambled on enough. I need to get some rest because my next game starts bright and early tomorrow and it's not technically at Gary Con....",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd1600b0>,osr,1711170360.0

* BlueMountainBooks has released a free hexcrawl on itch, inspired by Luke Gearing's Wolves Upon the Coast. [**~At the Base of Blue Mountain~**](https://bluemountainbooks.itch.io/at-the-base-of-blue-mountain) includes seven dungeons, nearly sixty hexes, and more.
* [**~Ventis~** ](https://gmshail.itch.io/ventis)was an entry in the Vaarn Summer jam, and is a city located at the edge of Vaarn. The art is really stunning in a minimalist, Vaarnian sort of way. I think this is a great little product to pick up either for Vaarn or to mine for ideas to plop into other settings.
* Another Vaarn adventure is [**~Penumbral Oasis, Part One~**](https://siofragames.itch.io/penumbral-oasis-part-one), a three level dungeon for characters of level 1-3.
* [**~Trouble at Bigby's Meadery~**](https://snailsong.itch.io/trouble-at-bigbys-meadery) is a system-neutral, lighthearted adventure that packs a surprising amount of content into 34 pages. It's the publisher's first product, which is always really great to see.
* Dice Goblin Games has published [**~Deep Delve~**](https://dicegoblingames.itch.io/deep-delve-dungeon-cairn), an adventure inspired by The Stygian Library and compatible with either Block, Dodge, Parry or Cairn. If you're looking for an adventure set in an abandoned dwarven mine this is the one for you. It's also available through [**~Drivethrurpg~**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/491825/deep-delve-adventure-for-cairn-block-dodge-parry?affiliate_id=253473).
* [**~Dark Tales for Dark Times~** ](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/488558/dark-tales-for-dark-times-bundle?affiliate_id=253473)is an OSR bundle now available on Drivethrurpg. It features eight publications by different authors, some adventures, some supplements, that all are written for OSR-style games. It looks to be a good bundle to pick up to get a sampling of some lesser-known OSR authors.
* I'm a sucker for a good kids on bikes game, and [**~Teenage Oddyssey~**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/485035/teenage-oddyssey?affiliate_id=253473) (not a typo) is another entry into the genre, this one embracing the awkwardness and humor of adolescence. The art is spot on and really captures the vibe. This game uses the Mark of the Odd system used by Into the Odd and others.
* One of my favorite things about doing this roundup is when I get to mention a game that is crowdfunding and then it pops up as published some time later, and I get to plug it again! [**~The Parthenogenesis of Hungry Hollow~**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/491687/the-parthenogenesis-of-hungry-hollow?affiliate_id=253473) is one of these. It's the first hardback adventure written for Liminal Horror. It also features art by one of my favorite artists: Amanda Lee Franck.
* Another such adventure is the seacrawl [**~Wind Wraith~**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/491592/wind-wraith-a-generative-wavecrawl-setting-toolkit?affiliate_id=253473), by Lazy Litch, who has really found a niche putting out spooky, creepy mini-settings and games.
* Continuing with the nautical theme, [**~The Undying Sea~**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/491441/the-undying-sea?affiliate_id=253473), by Dungeon Age Adventures, is an Into the Odd game set in a dying world.
* I'm in the process of harvesting peppers as the growing season begins to wind down, so it was perhaps serendipity that I stumbled across [**~The Chili Rat Chiefs~**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/491351/the-chili-rat-chiefs?affiliate_id=253473), an Into the Odd (lots of stuff for ItO this week!) adventure, a fun little short scenario that would work well as a one-shot.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd1760f0>,osr,1724064045.0

1hu8ltu,"If the encounter is balanced, runaway!","I always hear about the DMs worrying about creating balance encounters. 

And to this I always respond ""in 5e a balanced encounter is when will you kill all the monsters before any of the PCS die"". In osr a balanced encounter is when you kill the monsters before all the PCs die.

In other words a balanced encounter is equal to a fair fight. And it would be foolish to engage in a fight to the death that your party has equal odds of losing. At best one or two of you might survive.

What you really want is a fight of overwhelming odds when you kill all the monsters before any of you die but that is hardly balanced.

far more important than creating a ""balanced"" encounter is telegraphing to your players the difficulty of the encounter so they can decide whether and how to engage with it.

I share a few ideas on how to do that in my blog post.

1. I only post about products that have been released in the past week or have launched a crowdfunding project in the past week. When I started I would post links to pre-launch pages, as well, but I've switched over to only promoting active projects. It helps me keep track of what I've promoted, and I think you (the creator) get a bigger bang for the buck.
2. What started out as just OSR releases has morphed to include indie titles, as well.
3. All of the Drivethru links I post are affiliate links, which means that I get a small percent of any sales. This does not take anything away from the publisher's profit, and if given a choice between promoting a product on itch or another similar platform or Drivethru I always try and promote a non-Drivethru link.
4. This list is curated! I purposefully do not include products from alt-right publishers, and where possible I give priority to works by BIPOC, women, and other minority groups. Also, I under no circumstances will promote products that use AI.
5. I don't promote blog or substack posts; there are other places that do a good job collating these.
6. Other than affiliate links, I'm not paid (in either cash or product) to promote these products.
7. If you've got something you would like to see promoted please send me a message (via socials or my email at thirdkingdomgames at gmail dot com) and I'll see what I can do; sometimes I miss stuff!
8. I admit to using the Roundup to promote my own work, but I do try and put it at the bottom of the list so that others get higher priority.

That's about it. Thanks for reading, and here's to another three years! This is a bit of a short roundup; I'm guessing most folks are busy with holiday stuff.

* The Great Lakes Game Library has released [**Tales from the Northwoods**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/503649/tall-tales-of-the-northwoods?affiliate_id=253473), a collection of beasts, maps, and adventures written for Cairn and inspired by the myths and legends of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan.

1gbyo6u,"As a PLAYER, have you ever had fun dealing with encumbrance?","I love encumbrance as a referee. I believe it forces you into difficult decision making, weighing trade offs of carrying this treasure back home or keeping this tool that may prove useful as you continue. It leads to tense moments where your arrows or torches are close to running out.

That said, after years of running games with strict encumbrance rules I have yet to see my players actually ever experience that or enjoy the encumbrance mechanic.

I hope I am just doing something wrong and can fix it so my players get to experience the tense fun I intend to offer them, but I am starting to wonder if maybe I should give up and just stop caring about encumbrance.

1fe9qcw,3D6 Down The Line & Arden Vulgaris in Arden Vul - Observations on playstyles,"Like many here, I'm a big fan of the [3D6 Down The Line podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@3D6DTL) (""3D6"" from now on). I've also recently stumbled over the [Arden Vulgaris podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@EricVulgaris/videos) (""AV"" from now on) which I greatly enjoy (but be warned that the production quality is lower). Since they are both running the *Arden Vul* megadungeon, I find it interesting to compare the styles and discuss. Note that both GMs (Jon for 3D6, Eric for AV) are highly skilled and do an impressive performance. I thought I post some observations I made listening to them and comparing them, if anyone wants to chime in and discuss then I'm happy for all input!

(Obviously everything below is my own opinion. I've tried to avoid spoilers for *Arden Vul*.)

**Same players vs. open table**  
3d6 sticks with the same players, AV has an open table where anyone(?) can join, but many players are reoccurring. You definitely get more connection with the 3D6 players (they having better mic quality helps as well). The open table format makes it so that Eric forces all the AV sessions to start and end at a safe space. I never thought this would work when I started watching since 3D6 frequently gets stuck underground on major delves for >10 sessions, but it works great in practice which is pretty impressive. This also makes the in-game time move faster in AV which I like, 3D6 crams so much action into a few weeks that it sometimes feels unbelievable to me.

Overall I'm very impressed by the AV campaign (but it may just be that it's new and fresh for me) and it really shows that it's possible to run an open table using its methods.

**Canon**  
Both GMs stay close to Arden Vul as it's written, but they sometimes stray. Eric is a bit more liberal with the source material, sometimes changing stuff for no clear reason (as far as I can see). Jon has a tendency to ""amp up"" powerful enemies into unbeatable forces-of-nature, which I don't enjoy at all, but it doesn't happen that often so I can live with it. Erics changes are more often ""minor"" and tend to benefit the players and give them information or point them in the ""right"" direction. Both GMs tend to stray when the players go in an unexpected direction and find complicated rooms they haven't prepped, which is totally understandable. Both tend to retcon things from time to time, which is also understandable and they both do it fairly and elegantly IMO.

**Random encounters**  
Random encounters in 3D6 are pretty rare. I think this matches the rates in the adventure. In AV, random encounters seem to happen all the time. I thought this would kill the pace but I found myself enjoying it: the encounters are often optional or avoidable. I like how Eric frequently has wandering monsters block an entrance to the dungeon, which forces the players to change their plans and go explore somewhere else (which works since Arden Vul has so many places to explore). Overall it really makes the setting come alive.

**Information**  
Both GMs are very generous with information such as rumors, finding secret doors etc. compared to my interpretation of OSE as written. Eric goes one step further and has Thieves find secret doors and traps basically for free, often without even specifying that they are looking. Both approaches work: the 3D6 approach feels more fair but it's fun to watch the AV party gorge themselves on secrets.

**Pace**  
3D6 is more traditional, having the players do more of the ""OSR pixelbitching"" (for lack of a better term). Jon is very good at describing every detail of an encounter, even parts that may seem inconsequential or unimportant. But sometimes Jon puts down his foot and say ""there's nothing here"" or similar when the players get stuck trying to analyse the window dressing. AV is more ""railroady"" in a sense, Eric frequently tells the players conclusions they can make, he quickly skips through a couple of rooms to get them to where they're going, and he can hint very strongly at what the players ""should"" do next. I think AV kind of overdoes it, but I understand the need since the sessions need to end at a safe place. The higher pace also makes AV progress a lot faster: the party explores more and meets more NPCs than what 3D6 does in a similar time. The 3D6 approach is better even though I feel like its players sometimes forget that they are too ""high level"" to get stuck in ""low level"" problems that they have brute force solutions to. Game time is the most valuable resource IMO.

**Time wasters**  
Both podcast have an issue where pretty boring or inconsequential fights take too much time for my liking. The table might spend 30 minutes rolling dice to end up with five dead baboons and some wasted spell slots. AV also has the Luck resource from Shadowdark and a whole minigame around managing it (especially if any PCs are playing the Sage class). Even if it only takes a few minutes each session it eats table time and focus for no real benefit to the game IMO.

**Sunk costs**  
I'm impressed by how often AV players lose major magic items without much concern to try to retrieve them. AV players also use consumables much more liberally than the 3D6 party. The 3d6 players are more ""traditional"" and tend to hoard their resources and be very miserly about losing anything (often spending lots of table time to prevent the loss of some resource they could have found twice the amount of by continuing their delves). I think the difference is caused by the open table nature that makes players less attached to their stuff and characters, and more willing to take risk for great gain. I think good advice to players is to play in the AV style: use your resources, take risks and know that there's always more of the good stuff so don't be afraid to use it. 

**Story (spoilers ahead)**  
>!It's very interesting to see how both parties go down similar roads: Both hate the halflings and invest disproportionate resources into their destruction. Having NPCs that are obnoxious and take the players stuff really does aggravate them even if it's only a minor annoyance in the grand scheme of things. Both end up allying with the goblins. Makes sense since the goblins are accessible and not-obviously-evil, but it seems like the Settites or the Beastmen could fill a similar role in other campaigns. The beastmen are treated completely differently, likely because the first encounter in AV was hostile but 3D6 was non-hostile. First impressions really do matter.  !<",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd2f9fa0>,osr,1726060186.0
1i62dx5,OSR Shift from Advanced to Basic?,"Back when I got connected with the OSR in 2009 or so, it seemed like almost everything was focused on AD&D and its derivatives (e.g. OSRIC). I was mostly on Dragonsfoot back in those days.

I'm just getting back into it after ~12 years of not playing, and it seems like the OSR is very focused on Basic D&D and successors nowadays. When did this change happen? What caused it?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd312120>,osr,1737410385.0
1j1gtxt,I wrote an OSR-inspired fantasy novel,"I've just published my OSR-inspired fantasy novel, *House of the Rain King*. I think if you're into old school D&D, you'll love this book! But rather than giving you the regular pitch that I give to fantasy fans, I thought I'd talk about the OSR influences and how the book developed from an adventure module into a novel.

Way back, probably 6 or 7 years ago, I was reading James Raggi's *Better Than Any Man.* This adventure module had a lot of issues, but I fell in love with its core mechanic. In the module, the Swedish army is sweeping across the land and killing everything in its path. The army moves across the hexmap each day according to a schedule, and when they reach a town or adventure site, they destroy everything there. If the players didn't go to that site, too bad - it's gone now.

At the same time I was reading Michael Swanwick's classic sci-fi novel *Stations of the Tide*, which is about a planet suffering a once-in-a-generation high tide that will flood the entire continent.

The two ideas combined in my head as an adventure module where the PCs visit a valley that is gradually flooding. There would be a hexmap showing the growth of the river and lake each day, until finally everything is underwater. There would also be dungeons that flood from the bottom up, potentially submerging treasure but also sometimes opening new pathways.

I found a lot of dynamism in this premise. When floods come, people have to abandon lots of material possessions, so there would be plenty of opportunities for the PCs to grab stuff if they are willing to risk the rising waters. 

Around this time I also read Raggi's *The God That Crawls,* a dungeon containing a single invincible monster. This gave me the idea of a flooding dungeon inhabited by a senile rain god who wanders the halls in a stupor. He isn't very fast or aggressive, but if you get too close to him you will suffocate (too much moisture in the air). The rain god is also the reason the whole valley is flooding.

I never got to run this module, however.

Various issues led to the collapse of my online and offline gaming groups, and for a few years I didn't play D&D at all.

That was when I came up with the idea of turning the adventure module into a novel.

Long story short - all the stuff I described above is in the novel. The novel is told from the POV of the ""adventuring party"" (mercenaries who've recently arrived in the valley) as well as from several of the local people trying to survive the flood.

In writing the novel I added some elements that would appeal to traditional fantasy fans, but there is still a lot of OSR DNA in there. For instance, you will find:

* verb-noun spellcasting
* random encounters
* a dungeon crawl
* an egalitarian band of adventurers who resolve their disputes by arguing a lot
* shenanigans involving ropes and lanterns
* weird monsters
* treasure

(There is also one scene that has a specific reference to something from the AD&D Dungeon Master's Guide... I don't know if anyone will spot it though.)

1eragdb,What are your must-have OSE house rules?,"I'm preparing to run a dungeon-focused OSE campaign (possibly Arden Vul) in the next few weeks and I'm working on a list of experimental house-rules that I may or may not implement as time goes along. I've run a lot of other OSR systems, but never OSE. I'm using 3d6 Down the Line's house rules (https://www.3d6downtheline.com/house-rules) as a base since there's a lot of good stuff in there. However, I'm curious if there are other ones that people would recommend. 

In particular, I'm looking for house rules that help you deal with situations that often arise during OSR play, such as a simple subsystem for managing retainers, chase/escape rules, how to handle marching order/torches (we play online), etc. Thanks in advance!

1gjk58n,New Generation Experiences His First Character Death,"The more things change, the more they stay the same. I'm running a game in Arden Vul with a mix of older players (men in our 40s) and a few younger ones (the 16-19 year old kids of one of the players.)

The system I'm using is homebrew: a mix of the spirits of early edition AD&D2e and second edition Shadowrun would be a somewhat accurate one-line description. The rules don't really matter to the story. Heavily armored characters are able to absorb more damage than more lightly armored skirmishers.

The youngest player was one such heavy infantry fighter. In melee with a skeleton wielding a battle axe and its four skeletal hounds, he takes a heavy hit to the head and rolls very poorly so that his armor helps him not at all. He survives but is left near death.

""Should I withdrawal?"" he asks. He has the option to withdrawal without being attacked, but he needs to use his action to do it.

""Just hit the dog, you then he won't be attacking you. You can take another hit from the skeleton,"" the player using him as a shield to attack from the second rank advises.

This character is much more lightly armored, so the advice is self-serving, but by the numbers even if the younger player suffers another critical hit, he should be able to soak it down to where he would survive with quick medical attention.

The kids seems unsure, but decides to stay in the fight and does destroy one of the last skeletal hounds.

The skeleton rolls another critical hit, and again the player rolls extremely poorly. Statistically, to roll so poorly was a 1% chance, but that was salt in the wound. The chance to survive the hit would have been only around 6%.

""Fun game, real fun game,"" he pouts and pulls out his phone by reflex.

I was worried at this point, kids these days and all that, but honestly that was often the reaction when I was a kid and a character died. I waited to see how he handled it. After another minute of combat, he was drawn back into the conversation as the players finished off the skeleton and then began to part out the dead character's equipment.

By the end of the session, he had a lot of questions about what types of wizards existed in the world, and he is now excited to play a character with magic.

The kid learned that the world is deadly and that he shouldn't take advice from the player using him as a literal meat shield.

Even the characters apparently learned a life lesson from the encounter. They returned to town and with one less character to divide the gold, each earned more individual XP than they would have otherwise.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd361a00>,osr,1730741882.0

1dk87zt,"Has anyone here ran ""D&D"" at a public library as a program for their local community, using a rules set other than D&D 5e?","I would like to run ""D&D"" at my local library.  This would be sponsored by the library, advertised by the library, and open to the public.  So I would expect some normies and first time players here.  But I'm not crazy about running 5e.  I don't hate 5e, but the library would give me limited time to run a game (2 hours, once a week) so I would like to have a fun D&D experience, but with a rules set that plays light and fast, to maximize those 2 hours without wasting time getting bogged down in the rules.

But I also don't want to bait & switch anyone.  If I advertise this to the public as playing D&D, I'm not sure how actually playing something other than D&D would go over. 

I suppose I could advertise this as some kind of retro gaming night, and run D&D B/X, but I'm not sure how well that would be received.  I also thought about maybe running D&D 5e, but only using the D&D 5e free basic rules, to try to keep things a little lighter.  I definitely would not want to run 5e in this situation using any 5e books beyond the Player's Handbook, DMG, and Monster Manual.

1gowm7t,One of my players just...doesn't get it ,"Making one of those ""player doesn't really understand/embrace OSR"" posts because I'm not really sure how else I might be able meet this player where they're at. 

A bit of context: I'm the DM of a four-player group online. We started by playing 5e together, and there is one player who will run a Call of Cthulu scenario for us when I'm feeling too busy or burnt out to run the game. I started exploring non-5e systems a couple years ago and after the OGL fiasco I was able to convince this group to try something else as our mainline game. We started with *Shadow of the Demon Lord* last year because it was easy to pick up and we liked the grimy vibes, but I found it wasn't sandbox-y enough. 

This year, we've been running a Black Sword Hack game that I have hitched a bunch of procedures from Errant and Knave onto to make it a little more crunchy (including spending gold for XP instead of the milestone advancement in BSH). I did my very best to set expectations for how this would differ from 5e - we had a session zero, set some ground rules, I wrote up a reference document that had some basic mechanical information and a lot of guidance on OSR gaming philosophy. Three of the players love it. They like the flexibility of a classless system and have really taken to using their equipment, the environment, and their own wits in really creative ways, and are very motivated to set their own goals and interact with the world. 

My last player is totally checked out. This surprised me because in our 5e games he was very creative when dealing with combat encounters, and absolutely loves hoarding gold so I thought more tactical infinity and a more greed-motivated playstyle would click for him. We're good friends outside of the game and while hanging out, he's expressed that he doesn't know what his 'role' in the Party is without class-specific abilities, and that he prefers to have a narrative presented to him to follow and that he feels 'lost' when presented with a sandbox. I've acknowledged that this is definitely a different experience, and that maybe in future we can try a system that has more defined classes, but also pushed him on the question of game narrative. Out of game I've tried to gently encourage him to engage with the sandbox world and in-game, when it seems appropriate, dropped little tidbits in the form of rumours or encounters that might be threads to follow, but it doesn't seem to be catching him. When strategizing with the other players, he'll say things like ""I think this is where \[DM\] wants us to go"" or ""well clearly, this is setting up our BBEG"" and other...idk, 5e-isms that suggest to me he still thinks of the game as a story arc that I have planned out beforehand and am trying to shoehorn them into.

Days away from my 52nd birthday, I realized I've never ever played AD&D 1e as written. I played pretty much continuously into my 20's and RPG's into my 40's, but I thought I had.

After the last two months reading up on different OSR titles and settling into OSRIC because it felt so right, I really started digging deep reading back through my old 1e books and house rules to see what to bring into my OSRIC based campaign. My mind just seemed to skim over the BtB parts I really never played with, and some are also omitted by OSRIC as well.

Some of those old campaigns I DM'ed for years, some I played in for years. It wasn't until I recently stumbled upon  [Anthony Huso's blog](https://www.thebluebard.com/playables) and just how far away from BtB my friends and I really were. We didn't use weapon speed factor, psionics or D6 initiative in most cases. If we did it was heavily house ruled.

After a few days I realized why I and my friends over the years never played ""vanilla"", or BtB as kids say these days. Two things really, complicated book keeping and the math. You see, Anthony has taken this burden from his players and himself with incredible spreadsheets, deep preperation, and some mild house-ruling that make doing both *much, much* easier. It makes the issues I had just not have the impact as they did to me ""back in my day."" 

It seems, he does this for the same reason we ether didn't play with those rules or house ruled them. Nobody likes a slow ass game. With a deep understanding of the rules as written and his ability to tool the worst parts away allows his games to run much, much smoother than I could have imagened. I think for the first time in my life I finally understand most of the rules I wouldn't play with before.

That doesn't mean I'll be running my game BtB. My table is a pen and paper affair. Rules printed on paper, characters on paper, and records keeping on paper. I want to run an ""Old School"" game but I'm not as willing to adheare completely to ADDICT or play with rules that cause me to do a ton of math or heavy records keeping. I don't have the capability or capacity to do so. I also won't use spreadsheets I couldn't build or maintain myself.

Will combats be deadly? Sure. Will players have to keep track of gold and encumberance? You bet. I may use psionics thanks to Anthony's explinations and handy charts.

1einpk3,What modern additions to old-school rules have you warmed up to?,"After more than a decade of protest, I've finally come around to accept that maybe ascending AC is the superior system. Target20 is a cool workaround for descending AC, but I think ascending AC is just more intuitive. But thanks to OSE (and also BG3) I've come around on the idea without too much pain. Just as long as we aren't getting 3e AC numbers!

Are there any rules that took you a while to accept?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd515e80>,osr,1722639082.0
1hf68in,Afraid to Do Anything,"I joined an OSR group a couple years ago, and I've been enjoying for the most part.

One thing that has hindered my enjoyment at times is the fear of doing anything ""wrong"".

The way this group plays, if you make a wrong or ""stupid"" decision, it can easily kill you, or even TPK

For example, in one session, we were hired to do a job. We did said job, and later heard that employer was involved in some missing people. We went to the employer's house to ask some questions regarding this. Later that night, the employer sent a creature that one shot all of us to the inn we were staying at. The only reason we didn't TPK was because the DM essentially retconned us winning the fight. The DM said we should have never gone to the employer's house to ask questions. 

Things like this have resulted in me being afraid to do anything, make decisions, or take any action in games. I'm too afraid to make a ""dumb"" decision and be embarrassed and die. Is this just something that is a part of OSR style play, or is this just tough DMing? ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd533f20>,osr,1734307674.0
1dqq5sc,"Any real play podcasts that play OSR games in a less ""meme"" way?","By ""meme"" I mean ""everyone is goofing off and their characters are constantly dying in wacky circumstances"". I have nothing against that, it can be hilarious, but I am also curious for examples of people who have managed to create an actual story or a character arc while using an OSR system.

Any recommendations?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd55aff0>,osr,1719598065.0
1ik33z5,Another West Marches/Open Table question: how on earth are you supposed to always get back to town?,"I'm sorry if this is a really dumb question but I don't know if I've ever seen it addressed in real detail, and I've read as many blogs and other West Marches posts as I can find without seeing a satisfactory answer.

I'm putting together an open table game and, in spite of my ADHD over-prep and perfectionism, trying to take to heart the advice that running multiple parties without having everyone get back to the central location at the end of each session *a la* West Marches is impossible.

But I can't wrap my head around how that itself is possible? It seems like a much harder requirement to consistently fulfill than just allowing different groups to wander the landscape at their own pace and dealing with plot entanglements as they pop up?

Assuming that the game world is dynamic and responds to player actions, that hexes get restocked after a while, that factions make their own moves etc; doesn't this mean that in practice the exploration radius for any given party will never extend beyond where they are able to travel in a single session?

Put differently: you can basically explore a day's travel in any given direction, but when the clock strikes midnight the adventure turns into a pumpkin and suddenly everyone has to go home?

Unless we're completely hand-waving travel back to town (no chance of random encounters etc), wouldn't getting back to the starting location occupy a larger and larger percentage of any given session as players fulfill the actual purpose of the campaign and explore more territory? What if they're in the middle of a massive combat?

I'm willing to accept that I'm overthinking this, but it also feels like I have to be missing something here because I am not an inexperienced GM and yet the logistics of not just shooting for, but *requiring* that the party return to base at the end of every session seems totally game breaking.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd576540>,osr,1738955790.0

* Loads of pages of hex paper which I didn’t need. I want one hexmap!
* No table of contents for referencing or page numbering.
* I wanted to have both lined and gridded paper available to me on a spread, so I can do mapping and notes side by side.
* I also wanted a mini-hex in the lined section, so I could know the terrain.
* I needed something that could facilitate big campaigns and dealt with the annoyance of having to flick to the map to see the surrounding terrain.

1eznrwe,How deep does a world have to be?,"As a primarily 5e GM, I have grown extremely burnt out from the ""design a plot"" way of GMing that is common in 5e play culture. Going to the OSR, what excites me is to make a big sandbox open world game with a lot of things to explore. However, now I am wondering, how important is it that this world has deep lore, is unique/original etc, for the enjoyment of the players? I know mega dungeons exist, and those have lore but it's often more about the challenges and joy of exploring. 

Is it fine if I just plonk down some dungeons from a few modules, take ""generic fantasy"" as the setting, and just play? Is it important that everything is very well integrated? 
Perhaps this is lazy GMing, but I'd love to just play and have fun right now in a way that doesn't burn me out like much of prep has done in the past",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd5fd9a0>,osr,1724447086.0

1ei8bif,I don't get OSR. Help? ,"I was born in 5th edition, and have been relentlessly branching out since the OGL situation last January. 

I haven't read an osr book yet, but I have skimmed through some quick starts and Kickstart demos. 

When I sit down to *read* them, I just feel lost. 

Here's what I have, please correct me if I'm wrong:

You're usually rolling a d20+mod, aiming higher than a target number. Characters have basically no HP, and are created by rolling on a table. The author's aren't going to make a rule for every situation, the GM is going to make rulings instead. 

Gameplay should be fast. We're not spending time looking up rules. We're going to adjudicate and move on to the storytelling. Kick in the door. Kill the monsters. Loot. Repeat. 

Help?

**Edit** This is awesome. Thank you for the feedback, folks.

Updated understanding: You're not special, you're Indiana Jones instead of Jason Borne (which is not to mention Captain America, who is comparatively off the charts). So this isn't ""heroic fantasy"" as much as it's ""exploring dangerous spaces fantasy."" And at the end of the day, Indy still has a mortgage, so he finds ancient dungeons, sneaks his way through, grabs stuff, says ""this belongs in a museum"" and then sells it to the museum.

More specifically, what I'm looking for, is a game that has a midpoint between those two concepts.

1ehfjsx,Hilariously oversized parties,"I'm running Castle Xyntillan. My group is new to OSR. We're running it Swords and Wizardry style, and my players, being canny dudes, quickly realized the utility of hiring henchmen after losing a couple of retainers to animated ovens and beheading traps.

On their latest return to town, they splurged and hired everybody. I'd had fun generating mini profiles and portraits for all potential hires, and the players spent a fraction of their latest haul hiring the max number of henchmen their charisma allowed.

So now they're returning to Castle Xyntillan with about 13 hirelings, whom they've outfitted with all the best armor and gear they could buy.

Which is at once hilarious and feels incredibly unwieldy. This has become a completely different game, with a dozen light and heavy footmen preceding the players into every room. 

How do you guys handle mass-hirings? Just laugh and roll with it? There obviously aren't infinite hirelings left in town, and the repercussions will catch up with the group eventually (though they're willing to just throw more gold at the problem).

1ebfnry,Experimenting with loops (an exercise in dungeon building),"Having read and admired the dungeons in [Many Gates of the Gann](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/105975/Many-Gates-of-the-Gann) and [The Forgotten Grottoes of the Sea Lords](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/274219/advanced-adventures-41-the-forgotten-grottoes-of-the-sea-lords), I thought it might be interesting to break down how Guy Fullerton and Keith Sloan went about designing their dungeons. So I reverse engineered their layouts in Photoshop, trying to drill down to the essential basics, then built my own version in Dungeon Scrawl, step by step.

I had fun putting this together, and even though the end result isn't anything special, I thought I'd share here with the community. Also, the map only takes you so far - it's the encounters that really make a dungeon special, but here I'm just focusing on the layout. If this all reads as incredibly obvious stuff, my apologies!

They both focus on loops. Jacquaysing seems to be the standard approach these days, as it allows parties to circle around enemies, find alternative routes through dungeons, and have bad guys ambush the heroes in turn.  So, I drew a bunch of loops.

https://preview.redd.it/34ixrqegpjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c01ad4ee2264fd376dbefe193ac3de2c087d7a

Where there are a lot of intersections, you can drop in some large hallways and rooms, important locations that might act as centers of gravity for the dungeon, or, conversely, small rooms that might act as little more than glorified crossroads are places to station guards.

https://preview.redd.it/t6m87rnspjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c7a59308e1e53ff9f6e07833cf80ab0ef74ed5

Once you've got your loops in, you just start adding a bunch of rooms to the curves. These can be tiny clusters that will act as warrens/centers of operation for the denizens, or just random rooms that go nowhere. Even if you have a sequence of three connect rooms, these don't loop, so are in effect a dead end [(see Melan's dungeon mapping technique](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/45711/roleplaying-games/xandering-the-dungeon-addendum-how-to-use-a-melan-diagram)). Obviously you vary the size, the shape, and try to keep things interesting. I added some natural caverns to the very south, with vague ideas of this being a no-man's land that's kept gated off the main complex.

https://preview.redd.it/vo0g72rxpjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=b30a82004bd59fcf8c2a3d8bf7df97137aacb51b

The next step is to straighten the hallways so that the looping isn't terribly obvious. Add walls to some of the large chambers so that not everything is isolated down its own hallway. I used the 'rough' feature on Dungeon Scrawl to make the caverns look more organic and interesting.

https://preview.redd.it/fiuy64w8qjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=a319eab9fe5fa07fd12631d47030ef27e353a4d8

At this point, it helps to scrutinize the map and wonder where the spheres of influence might be. You generally want a couple of major factions on any given floor for a map this size, and then two or three smaller operators that the party can interact with. I decided the very bottom right and top left would work, as they'd leave lots of empty space between them, as well as having the most complex looking layout for organizations to utilize. More on that later.

Next was adding doors, statues, pools of water, prison cells, one way doors, daises and thrones, all the good stuff that makes a dungeon interesting and provides fodder when it comes to actually creating the encounters that brings a dungeon to life.

https://preview.redd.it/yfj4u9ynqjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e60c8724ac24e3530bd7ae822261317bc928212a

Not only that, but you want several ways into the dungeon, and several ways to the next floor below. I made sure there were a handful of each. Red indicates ways in from the surface, green indicates ways down to the second floor.

https://preview.redd.it/8vot6tr3rjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=c668bda696fbba431cde7cf9cc4e456831d27529

So a couple of main staircases lead down into the complex, neither too close to each other but within spitting distance of the large throne room. However, I also added a secret tunnel coming into the cave complex. I could probably have added another way in, a chute somewhere perhaps from a surface ruin, but that's fine for now. Then, heading down, you have an official staircase off the throne room, the spiral staircase in the upper west, and the grand pit in the hexagonal room. You also have a secret chute in a prison cell, as well as a 'lost' spiral staircase in a caved off room. Lots of ways to navigate both up and down. Still, might benefit from even a few more.

Finally, I colored in the spheres of influence. Green in the bottom right, being so close to the throne room, is probably the 'official' inhabitants of the complex, while red in the upper left are a rival faction. Yellow and purple are independent operators (lost adventurers, rogue mercenaries, an independent sage, whatever.). And the dark blue would be environmental hazards, ranging from interactive statues to traps. All this of course would be finessed when you actually write the keyed encounters. Here, it just gives you a sense of what might work, and whether you need to add a couple random more rooms or whatever.

https://preview.redd.it/7w4ck2girjed1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0ac5d458b916005c557f32ab2910fdb4ca1c72f

The remaining rooms are empty. This allows the dungeon to breathe, gives room for wandering monster encounters, and can feature clues, loot, or means to convey history about the complex. I could see adding one more independent operators, maybe a few more traps or the like, but for the most part, you want a good chunk of the dungeon to be dark and still.

And there you have it. A dungeon with loops. My final result is nothing special, but it allowed me to explore some of the design practices that I think Guy Fullerton and Keith Sloan used for their wonderful modules.

Add in new monsters, interesting loot, small hidden mysteries, opportunities for straight combat, a few strange and powerful dungeon denizens, chances to bargain and make allies, complex set pieces (the throne room, the massive statue chamber, the caverns), lots of ways to travel between levels, environmental hazards, and puzzles, and you're well on your way to an enjoyable dungeon.

(Caveat: this was just generated out of nothing, with no story behind it. If you're creating a dungeon for a campaign, obviously the context would inform the design, whether it be a wizard's abandoned complex, a complex series of sea caves, or whatever. You'd also have to think first about the factions, make sure they have access to exits, and all that. This was a simple exercise, so please excuse any obvious shortcomings!)

I hope you guys enjoyed this. Again, I know it's no great shakes, but I find exploring the theories behind dungeons to be really interesting, and thought I'd share. Cheers!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd76cda0>,osr,1721862902.0
1dz1zln,“Less simple” osr games ,"I have been playing RPGs since I was a kid in the 80’s. In general a lot of the osr stuff that I have checked out is pretty sweet. OSE advanced is probably my favorite systems wise. One thing that I don’t love is the trend towards “simple” games. While I am not saying that is horrible, my preference tends to the complexity level of 1st / 2nd edition (more on the side of first) ad&d. What are some good osr games that aren’t necessarily overly complicated but that don’t use simplicity as a selling point?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd78b950>,osr,1720530524.0
1dboeef,Letting Go or How I Learned to Truly Love The Sandbox,"I thought I’d share this after a series of good experiences running a game recently. I felt that it something that GMs/DMs run into occasionally or perhaps it could be a learning experience as it was with me.

So I’ve been playing tabletop roleplaying games for around 17 years. But I didn’t cut my teeth on traditional starting games, like Dungeons and Dragons. In fact, my first game was the Chronicles of Darkness (I believe that’s the name of the series, I always just called it World of Darkness). More specifically Changeling: The Lost. It was a nice, straightforward system, but one that emphasised these deep, interpersonal narratives, and had this detailed and interesting lore. It was more about telling a story, rather than playing a game. It had a profound impact on me and how I run my games from then on…And part of the problems I’d come up against later.  

Over the years, I have run years long campaigns to one-shots, covering a range of systems. I’ve mostly ended up running science fiction games, with the occasional foray into horror or fantasy. I’ve ran things as rules-light, with a focus on story first, rules second. I sort of run a sandbox at the start of games, but they always end up drifting into this grand narrative that they players want to pursue. Chapter one is always a ‘Fuck around and find out’, and when players become a little more aware, when they’re presented with several hooks, when they’re settled into their characters, it tends to change into the narrative-led campaigns I’d like to think I’ve done an alright job over the years, gaining experience with each session ran, though I would not call myself an expert.

A few years ago, I was recommended Stars Without Number by a friend. My gaming group was finishing up a fantastic campaign (I was the player this time) and were looking to the future. I volunteered to run a science fiction game but I was about to go with my choice game of Mongoose Traveller. However, Stars Without Numbers seemed good. It was straightforward to learn for both GM and players, had a plethora of tools to use and I could create my own setting.

The campaign was great! I thoroughly enjoyed it and I believed (or hoped) the group did too. There was mixture of laughter, joy, sadness, horror, anger, confusion and all the great elements of a game. In fact, it got me hooked onto the whole OSR movement. (I know there is a disagreement about what truly is OSR, but I believe Kevin Crawford’s games are OSR…Or at the very least, that gateway drug into it). However, there was one thing I struggled with. Burn out. The ending of the campaign could have been better. I’ve reflected on this for a while, and I think it was apparent to both myself and my players. I was tired…And I wanted to finish something that I had planned to go on for a little bit longer. My ending I originally planned was blown out the water and significantly improved by what the players did, and done in such a way that would allow us to return to the setting in future.

But why was I tired? Simply put, I was too focused on making everything bespoke. Maybe out of stubbornness, or maybe out of the compulsive need to be making a campaign my own, I ignored the fantastic toolkit provided by Kevin, or the tools provided by others in the community. I created a sandbox, the players latched onto a hook and I needed to carefully and cautiously create every intricate detail. NPCs, religions, worlds, government systems, quests, encounters, food, cultures, names. Nothing must be left to chance and I must handcraft everything. The players make their decisions and I get to work. Sometimes it takes an few hours to prepare…Sometimes longer…When it is created, and I present it. Sweat falls from the brow, my eyes well up at the hard work. I’ve done it. I’ve done it.

…Only for the players to ignore most of it…

I laugh now and I recount a particular experience when I created an Alien-themed dungeon exploration. It took weeks for me to create this bespoke planet, dungeon, alien, clues, lore…Only for the players to by-pass it a good chunk of it. We had fun, there was tension, there was cheers when the alien creatures were defeated, and there were gasps when the alien abilities were discovered…But the experience broke me and it was at this point, I started to really feel the burn-out.

Now, allow me to diverge slightly on different (but relevant) tangent. A few years ago, I used to work as a teacher. People in the UK (but I suppose the same could be said elsewhere) know that teaching is a tricky job, with uncompetitive pay, ever-increasing high workloads, ever-present burn-out. I was entering a school as an NQT, being the only person who taught my particular subject. It very hard, but rewarding. But in that first year, I made all these resources, activities, plans. Everything must be organised for the enjoyment of the class, if I don’t have absolute control over this, they won’t learn or enjoy…Doesn’t this sound familiar? After my first year, I began to take stock and one of the best pieces of advice I was given was…Work smarter, not harder…Sounds easy right? But this was revolutionary to me at that time. So I began to get into my own, looking through what in the past year worked, what didn’t, and how I could streamline it as much as I could. I managed to get into my own groove as a ‘chalk and talk’, old-school (pardon the pun) teacher. The lessons with the less prep and easier activities, ended up being the most fun for us all. Why? Because I wasn’t killing myself with overwork and the kids knew that. If did this with my teaching job, why the hell wasn’t I doing it with running campaigns!?

So after that campaign, I just became a player for a while. Getting immersed into the world of the OSR, learning how other GMs run their games and taking inspiration from low/no prep. A few months ago, some friends outside of TTRPG gaming were going through a tough time. I suggested that we all meet up regularly to play games online. We started to do this, and we wanted to make it a bit more of a permanent fixture. Going off the recent success of Baldur’s Gate III, I suggested we play a TTRPG. Some of the group had a little experience with one-shots I ran in the past (and had fun!), some had no experience. So I decided I would run a Worlds Without Number game…I would run a fantasy game (outside of my typical sci-fi comfort zone) and I would run it milking absolutely every tool I could. I would be the laziest GM there was. Everything was to be completely randomised. Names, quests, locations, hooks, encounters, enemies, traps. I would merely act as a glue to fit it all together…Or to ditch it if needs be. I created a basic world, history, calendar and religion. These could fit on a small document and be vague enough for players to explore as they see fit. I created a starting encounter (prison break, a nice Elder Scrolls feel to it) and after that, the group took over. A few landmarks, cities and villages were scattered around. No work was done to them unless the players stated they would go there. So far, blood cults have been infiltrated, dungeons delved, they have been exiled from villages and they’re currently in the middle of taking down a gang. All created by what they wanted, and what was rolled. The most I have prepped for a game was 6 hours, before we even started (this was the world-building creation stated before). Since then, I have been 45 minutes to 1 hour prepping. I have never prepped for more than 1 session ahead. Maybe a little more prep with dungeon delving, as I’m getting used to making dungeons on DungeonCraft and using tools on Roll20, but prep is taking nowhere near as long as it once did. I’ve been running this for several months and it’s going great. I started to let go…

What has trigged this self-reflection? My players are saying how much they are enjoying it. They’re creating resources, lore, and memes. In fact, they are enjoying it as much as if I’d made everything by hand and had control in absolutely everything. The only difference is that I’m not breaking my back to see it happen. It’s been such an enlightening experience running a game this way. I know that there may have been other factors in all this and that our collective enjoyment can’t just be down to a single lightbulb moment, but I feel it’s worth sharing.

We live in world where there is an expectation that GMs have to reinvent the wheel and create everything by hand and establish these grand narratives, whilst also dealing with the insane workloads that come from that. People talk about a GM shortage sometimes, and I feel that this mindset, does have some bearing on the issue. I know many people might say that ‘online person doesn’t use the tools properly. Doesn’t have fun. Eventually uses tools. Has fun’ but I think there is a huge mindset shift that goes with this.

Similarly, there’s probably people reading this saying ‘Woah, get a load of this guy making the absolute worst choices when running a game’ and ‘I’ve always run games in this way, this isn’t revolutionary’. Well to me, it was. Moreover, I think there is an immense pressure out there to create and plan way too much. Sometimes learning is about making the mistakes and building from that.

So, work smart and not hard GMs out there. Avoid what I did…Or, actually, do what I did. Learn what you can do, self-reflect, make those mistakes, and learn to avoid in future.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bd791850>,osr,1717919187.0

That’s 0.136 miles per hour! I’ve actually tried to move this slowly and wasn’t able to do it. It was maddening.

So why not include checking for room traps and secret doors within this movement rate? Secret doors are so cool and so often missed because to find them the PCs are supposed to not just search but search specifically for secret doors.

Moving at 0.136 miles per hour, I promise you that you can find and catalog every single crack and divet on a cinder block wall from the floor to the top of your reach for the entire 120 feet you moved in ten minutes.

1ih3zx6,"One of my players (magic-user) has subtly complained about not being able to do anything and feeling useless, how should I address this?","So, first off, he's playing a Magician in a Dolmenwood campaign, he just hit level 4. I keep telling him there will eventually be a payoff, but we've gone through 1 large dungeon and 3 small ones at this point. Dude is a great friend of mine since childhood, there is absolutely no interpersonal conflict between us. This is not a ""talk to your player"" problem.

Here's some things I've heard him say or mention recently:

""I'm a magic-user, so I can't do anything this round.""

""I would use a spell here, but I don't know any, and we should save it for Sleep anyway.""

""I'm not even going to throw a rock because I have like a -4 to hit.""

""Being a magic-user is objectively worse than being a wizard in modern systems. There's no cantrips, but it's still somewhat satisfying to sleep a horde of enemies. It just rarely happens.""

And so on. I should mention, he does like the OSR playstyle, completely gets it, and he knows he has to think creatively. But I think he sometimes just wants to blast monsters, ya know? And sitting there watching the fighter run up and 1v1 tough foes while the cleric incinerates a horde of skeletons with turn undead... Yeah, I can kinda see why.

And to address some of his problems, he *has* found plenty of spells to learn, but most are situational, and he's always under the assumption Sleep is better so he's afraid to use up any slots. 

He is a Breggle, and can use his horns to attack which are better than any weapon he can use, but he is playing it smart and safe and does not get into any melee combat.

Basically I am looking for suggestions on how to handle this perceived imbalance (I am aware this is the nature of being a MU). But at the same time, I just want him to have more fun. 

Should I let him learn a cantrip? Give him magic rod which can cast a cantrip? How would I even go about designing a basic cantrip? Save vs. Spells or take 1d4 damage? 

And for what it's worth, I have allowed him to change classes, but he wants to commit to MU. I think he's trying to power through it.

1gpr25o,Mothership Month is happening and it's cool as fuck: An Orientation,"# [THE MONTH OF MOTHERSHIP! \[direct link here\]](https://www.backerkit.com/c/collections/mothership-month)

**WHAT IS MOTHERSHIP MONTH?**

Simply, a bunch of 1st and 3rd party designers are crowdfunding \~20 *SICK* Mothership books and zines on Backerkit in a community-oriented, group event.

The theme is CRIME!

It's like Zine Quest, but specifically for Mothership, and with some cherries on top.


**WHY SHOULD YOU CARE?**

Mothership is damn good. And these projects look incredible (more on those later). But aside from that:

The community-building that Tuesday Knight Games and 3rd party designers have been doing in the Mothership scene is incredible and I think it's important to support that. This event, via both TKG's and community support, gets art made and indie designers' rent paid.

Other designers take notice, this cross-collaborative model 100% translates to other games and communities.


***Disclaimer:*** *I'm not crowdfunding anything for Mothership Month, but I have worked with a few of these rad designers. While some of them are my friends, and I am contributing a small scenario as a stretch goal in the event, I'm writing this as a fan of Mothership first.*

*For context: I'm Ian Yusem, I published Hull Breach Vol. 1 and many other Mothership scenarios.*


# THE MODULES

If Mothership is known for anything, it is/should be its incredible modules—both 1st and 3rd party. This month's offerings are no exception.

Notably, there are some very cool bonus rewards if you back 5 or more projects (NPC card packs, etc.), so it's worth stretching to support extra projects if you only planned to back a few. They're calling it the *""Supply Drop""* if you're looking for details.

The following are few projects that I think look particularly dope, but I encourage you to poke through the whole roster yourself ([another link for you](https://www.backerkit.com/c/collections/mothership-month)).


[**WAGES OF SIN**](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/tuesday-knight-games/mothership-wages-of-sin)

This is the biggie. 1st party bounty-hunting hardcover written by Luke Gearing. If you didn't know, Luke is possibly the best module designer and among the best writers in TTRPGs (in my opinion, anyway).

It's a no-brainer. If you play Mothership, you're getting this.


[**PK49**](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/lone-archivist/pk49-a-psychokinetic-adventure-for-mothership)

This one reminds me strongly of Judge Dredd, particularly the 2012 movie: a dungeon crawl through gang-run apartment blocks (but in space and even more psychedelic). The graphic design is sure to be killer with Mothership veteran Lone Archivist (Primeval, etc.) at the helm.


[**INTERLOPER**](https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/a0914d97-b46e-401d-8ae1-67095bb10ad3/landing?ref=home-page)

A murder mystery sandbox adventure by Joel Hines, one of the more well-known 3rd party authors (Desert Moon of Karth, etc.). I'm really intrigued by the mashup of Joel's signature sandbox style with a more investigative approach.

1gj3liv,Realized I’m a pretty bad GM,"So quite a negative and rambly post but I wanted to share to see if any others have had similar feelings or if anyone could offer some much appreciated advice. 

I ran a session today and it really solidified in my mind that I’m not that great of a GM. I’ve been running games on and off for a couple of years now and I feel like a always find myself getting overly argumentative or agitated with my players, harming the atmosphere of the session.
I feel more like a ‘police of fun’ rather than a referee or someone who encourages creativite and fun play. 

My players often get distracted which I expect a little but often find quite disheartening. Can feel like some of the players do not care much for the game, I know this is mostly untrue but it can definitely feel this way sometimes.
I think that I might not be prepping fun enough adventures but I’m not entirely sure.

Anyways, I don’t expect to be an incredible GM but I think I’m missing something and I’m unsure of what that ‘something’ is.

I’ve posted this in this subreddit because my GMing style is mostly OSR inspired along with the game system we use also being heavily OSR inspired (a system I am currently developing).

Any observations or advice is greatly appreciated and if anyone has any questions please ask away.

EDIT: 
Thanks for all the helpful responses and possible solutions, its so nice to see that so many people in this community care about my random problem. I've sent a message to my players and they seem to be up for trying to focus more on the game, which I think will help me run the game overall.

I think I'm going to try and be more open with my players about how I feel in the moment and be more open to wacky solutions they might try and how being a fan of my plaerys can help me enjoy the game more. I think honesty about them being distracted and game expectations will go a long way since I've been friends with some of my group's members for my whole life.

Going forward I feel that I need to know my weaknesses, like being easily irritated, and just try to remember its a game and I should be trying to have fun as well as the players. I've also noticed that I can have quite a rude attitude to some players when they annoy me, which doesn't help anyone.

Once again, thank you for the help and I will definitely be reading some of the suggested GM advice material.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bdc32d50>,osr,1730685808.0

1f1hppl,Everyone's impressions of Cairn 2e?,"So, if you don't know, PDFs for Cairn 2e were already sent out for backers on Kickstarter like a month ago. But it seems like practically no one discusses it. People are just waiting for the full boxed set release in the next year? Or it just seems like there isn't much to discuss? 

Just to compare with something like Knave 2e, there was and still is a lot of discussion. And yes, much of it is pretty negative, but still, a discussion is a discussion. Like, again, it seems like people are pretty silent about Cairn 2e ""digital release"", like nothing happened.

For me, I really like what I saw in Warden's Guide, especially the bestiary with some great art and the big section about foreground advancement, without boring ""you earned 2000 xp, so now you can have +1 to your attack damage"" stuff, all of the advancement is in the fiction. Lack of progression is something I see often mentioned, where talking about using Cairn for a longer campaign, so it's nice to see it addressed. 

What are your opinions about Cairn 2e? Whether it's about the rules (but those aren't really different from 1e, so maybe there isn't much to discuss), backgrounds and Vald setting, Warden's Guide and its advice or about released adventures? Does somebody have already GMed some of them and, if yes, what was your experience?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bdc6dbb0>,osr,1724654763.0
1hiwm7y,Why Mystara?,"Hi!

I was born a few years after the waning years of both ADND 1e and the whole BECMI line. I'm now taking more interest in everything Basic, Expert and the Cyclopedia.

One thing from that period that is still very obscure to me is Mystara. I have at least a vague idea what almost every other D&D setting is about, or what sets them apart from others.

But Mystara is an absolute question mark for me. I know that some of the B/X adventures are suggested to be from it, and I know there's a long series of Gazetteers (I even own the first one!).

Yet, I keep seeing love letters to Mystara. It could just be that it was well written, or had some interesting ideas, or nostalgy. But I wonder if some fans of it could try and sum up for me what it has to offer. Why should I take interest in Mystara over any of the other settings?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bdc7a9f0>,osr,1734736921.0
1gkg8vo,Do you prefer race-as-class or race + class? Why?,"I normally prefer having both race and class as it feels more natural; having a race also be a class feels one-dimensional if EVERY elf can fight and cast spells, every dwarf is basically a fighter, and so on.  It's a big reason I was NOT a fan of the Basic D&D style as opposed to Advanced D&D, along with not liking the sandbox and hexcrawl approaches so common in the OSR.



However, the more I think about it, the more it also makes demi-humans feel alien and, well, not human. They feel completely unique and it makes the world feel different, rather than elves/dwarfs/etc feeling like humans with extras. For example, I feel like in a setting where elves are both a race and a class it feels more ""foreign"" to have an elf kingdom that's like Lothlorien rather than an elf kingdom that's like a human kingdom but with elves, with various classes like humans.



Which do you prefer?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bdcbd520>,osr,1730837976.0
1h6os1e,Trolls in the Trees: We need more lost troll civilizations in D&D,"Everyone knows trolls regenerate. What they don't know is that this also makes them practically immortal. This isn't because their souls are embodied, like Tolkein's elves. It's because trolls' regeneration was the product of an advanced civilization of magical bioengineers. Specifically, their own.

The key to their regeneration is a rare turtle that lives in certain swamps. The ancient trolls did something to the turtle and to themselves that gave them the ability to regenerate provided they consumed the flesh of the turtle every ten years or so. Modern trolls remain in the swamps, tending to their turtles and guarding the sources of their immortality with their lives. But they aren't so diligent about guarding the secrets of their creation because they don't remember them.

You see, troll regeneration isn't a perfect process. Over time, their skin and hair starts to acquire the texture and hue of their marshy habitat. Their postures becomes more hunched, while the process overcompensates with their nails and teeth, turning them into fangs and claws. But the biggest, most deleterious, change is to their intellect. The troll mind, perhaps much like a human brain, is not very good at storing several lifetimes worth of memories and knowledge and their regeneration does not do nearly enough to restore the functioning of their brains. The only reason trolls have even an average of ""low intelligence (5-7)"" after centuries of decline is because they fell from the dizzying heights of super genius intellect. 

So the next time your adventurers are exploring the ruins of a lost civilization and are staring at the large statues of their human-like rulers, they should perhaps consider that the size of the statues may not be artistic license, but accurate representation. Look a little closer at their handsome regal faces and they might notice the nose is a little too long and pointy. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bdcbe930>,osr,1733340509.0

1j2mfa2,"D&D 5e player, interested in Old School Essentials.  Looking for experiences.","Hi everyone,

I've played D&D since 4e, but I've always gravitated to using running games with less emphasis on rules and limiting longer combat sessions.  I didn't really understand the history of D&D and that there was a basic / extended version of D&D that was separate from AD&D.

That leads me to my post.  I'm interested in how OSE (B/X) differs from 5e (at a high level).  Are there folks here that have experience with both (I'd imagine the answer is yes)?  What are the strengths / weaknesses of both systems.  Are there any serious limitations with OSE (B/X) that people have run into?  Do players sometimes complain?

I'm hopeful that OSE would be a good fit for our gaming group.

Thanks for any advice!

1elg7ql,Tendency towards complexity in RPG's,"I was reading an excellent series of posts about *Traveller* {[Classic Traveller: Out of the Box!](https://talestoastound.wordpress.com/traveller-out-of-the-box/)), and the author emphasizes how indebted to the original *Traveller* LBB's were to D&D's original White Box. And that much how like D&D was originally a generic tool kit for fantasy games, Traveller was intended for generic Sci-Fi.  However, even by the time of the *Traveller Book* there was already a tendency to place more and more ""world"" information into the core rules and even mechanics. Fairly soon, the ""Third Imperium"" was THE *Traveller* setting. 

Others have noted a similar progression with D&D. White Box, Basic, heck even up to AD&D it was pretty generic/make your own setting. But, as the game progressed more and more things got answered until we were looking at things like Krynn or Faerun, settings that attempt to out Tolkien Tolkien. And this happens even in games that aren't ""overly generic."" One of my favorite games ever is *Vampire,*  and yet each supplement made the game less and less interesting to me.   
  
So, circling back to Traveller and the imposition of 3I early on its development--is there a unified theory or ideas as to why? Or it it just capitalism? After the core books, the players don't **need** the publisher, but the publisher still needs to eat, so creating these worlds keeps the company afloat. Is it a demand from players/GM's? Not everyone has the time or energy to create a whole setting/world from scratch after all. Is it due to a changing  audience?  For example, the original cohort of D&D designers and players grew up reading Howard and Vance and Leiber, but the following generation was more familiar with Tolkien, and then those inspired by Tolkien, and on and on until now when the Lord of the Rings movies, Harry Potter and video games are the entry path to Fantasy. Which means that ""logic"" of old school D&D makes little if any sense, if only because the basic frames of reference are so different.

1he3ych,"How is an open table (""West marches"") game actually supposed to work?","I'm very confused about how this concept actually works in play, especially when based around a megadungeon rather than a hexcrawl. Something like Gygax Jr's ""Marmoreal Tomb"" for example:

Let's say you have your megadungeon with hundreds of rooms, and the first week you have 4 players decide to explore its depths. They explore some rooms, kill some beasties, get some treasure, and at session's end return to town to rest. 

Next time, you have 3 different players come. Wouldn't this just be repeating the same thing as the earlier group with some differences? Different (perhaps wandering) encounters, the treasure in Room 4 isn't there anymore because Group A already got it, and so on? What exactly could Group B do that would make the session fun, unless you skip a bunch of the early rooms (which doesn't seem to be the idea although it's reasonable) or have tons of alternate entrances to the dungeon so Group A might have found one, Group B finds another in a different part of the dungeon (which seems nonsensical) so they're exploring a totally different area. Not to mention having to keep track of which room has/hasn't been explored (but that sounds fun)

How is this actually meant to work out? It seems like one group gets to ""actually"" play and the other groups are either going through rooms that have already been cleared out so don't have treasure anymore, maybe a handful have been repopulated or they fight wandering monsters, skipping ahead to something like ""You make your way through several rooms that have already been cleared out"" where they then get to explore further in, or something else?

","I listened to ""Loser"" by Beck while I was planning tonights session and I realized that it could be interpreted as an abstraction of what its like to GM a session of OSR dnd.  So I stopped planning my game and annotated the lyrics instead.

Loser by Beck:

In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey (I am the forever gm) 
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie (jacked up on redbull and rdy to roll) 
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables (painted beholder miniature ready to go, terrain on the table) 
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose (adding all the fine details and npc shopkeeps, etc)

Kill the headlights and put it in neutral (lets get going, players take the wheel) 
Stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control (internally I have no idea what im doing, bout to crash and burn) 
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D (wife is in the other room, taking care of baby, pissed off its thursday game night) 
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat (backup sleep plan if I wake her up cheering/arguing)

Someone came in sayin' I'm insane to complain(player defending the decision...) 
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt(for an insane stunt to get of a bad situation alive, rule lawyering me) 
Don't believe everything that you breathe (be the impartial referee) 
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve (let the dice dole out various fates, random encounters) 
So shave your face with some mace in the dark (the sensation of improvising when players now go way of the rails) 
Savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park (pulling out all the tricks to get back on track) 
Yo, cut it (enough, enter bbeg)

Soy un perdedor (the game is going down in flames, everyone's characters are dying, freaking out) 
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? (Dont get mad at me Im doing this for free) (Double-barrel buckshot) (another player character dies) 
Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? (Cmon lets keep playing this nerd ish)

Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare (my justification for the way way too difficult dungeon in the mod) 
Ban all the music with a phony gas chamber (stop the complaining by adding secret passage/ solvable trap) 
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag (players overcomplicate the very obviously solvable puzzle) 
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag (really muddling through - just pull the lever and put the thing in the other thing)

With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job (pcs survive, run it back again, taking way too many health potion, pcs scarred deformed) 
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob (back in town, improvising npc dialogue poorly) 
He hung himself with a guitar string (players not buying it) 
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing (descriptions of the food they order in game) 
You can't write if you can't relate (players cant agree on the next course of action, took poor notes) 
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate (running through various plans, outcomes) 
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite (me, the gm, just sitting there listening to the players) 
That's choking on the splinters (nitpick every detail before they make a decision)

1icagv6,What do you think are the most commonly misunderstood OSR phrases or sayings?,"A while back I saw two people arguing about the advice from Matt Finch's primer, such as ""Rulings, not Rules"" and ""Forget 'Game Balance'"". While the primer itself follows these saying with blocks of explanatory text, out in the wild they're often just dropped as ancillary shorthand. The particular argument I saw was based on reading the ""zen moments"" of the primer as a reaction to D&D3e rather than as a set of novel statements; that ""Rulings not Rules"" means a DM should be able to use rules for intuitive results rather than that detailed rules are to be avoided, and that ""forget game balance"" means players should sometimes be faced with challenges which must be worked around or avoided rather than the idea of a ""balanced encounter"" itself being anathema to the game.

What are other sayings of the OSR community that you've seen people struggle with, or aphorisms which could be confusing if you don't understand the context?

1cigk62,We fought the Dire Goose from The Monster Overhaul,"I'm playing in a Trespasser campaign. Last night the GM threw out the possibility of encountering a massive, evil goose. We had asked a shopkeeper if we could do any favors for him in exchange for the goods we need. He informed us that a massive goose had been seen roaming the area and terrorizing people. Recently, it appeared in his bedroom, vomited toads on him, then disappeared.

So, we went to where it supposedly had been seen last. It had constructed a nest filled with stuff it had stolen (some of which couldn't have been found locally). We saw the goose placing a halberd onto the nest. Our wizard cast invisibility on me. I snuck in, grabbed the weapon it had just obtained. It slipped out of my hand. The goose freaked out and failed in my direction. Didn't hit me due to the invisibility.

I picked up the halberd and ran to where my friends were laying in wait nearby. I took off my shield and threw it at the goose (this attack ended my invisibility). The goose caught it in it's mouth and tossed it onto the nest. I waved the halberd in the air and shouted ""Honk"" repeatedly. It gave chase and fell right into our ambush. We did immense damage to it quickly. All ending with me decapitating it with the halberd. 

I'm going to tie its skull with some twine and make a necklace. 

So, if you're running a game, throw the Dire Goose at your players. It's fun!

1h3cymx,"I compiled into a book and PDF a hundred sessions' worth of reports, illustrations, GM notes and player accounts of our open-table OSE campaign","[Guess the classic module](https://preview.redd.it/xdealog4k14e1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=70f26ed7a0f7cb0989a0c0ddf0619b0309044385)



A couple of months ago we played the hundredth session of our online open-table OSE campaign, a hex map populated with loads of modules new and old. I've been chronicling gameplay from the start on my [blog](https://therecouldhavebeensnakes.wordpress.com/keep-on-yeoldelands/) with the added personal challenge of including at least one picture to keep me drawing, and concluded most of them with some GMing reflections.

Players were also encouraged to send in their own accounts of the sessions either from their own perspective or that of their character for some bonus XP - not a huge amount, but enough to reduce the sting from treasure-less expeditions. Those had been archived on Kanka.io, but that quickly became unwieldy to reference.

So to mark the occasion, I compiled all the above into a hyperlinked PDF for a more convenient reading experience, and uploaded a book version to Amazon, wanting an accessible printed version for anyone who, like me, might prefer to reduce screen time.

Hopefully it may be of help to folks contemplating running an open-table campaign in this digital age, an encouragement to those anxious about their imperfect GMing (I make mistakes aplenty), of interest to anyone curious as to how some classic modules might play out, or of service to whoever fancies a new paperweight or doorstop.

1cp92si,Regarding Ten-Foot Poles,"Ten-foot poles. Regularly considered to be the single most important object the galaxy ever did spawn. (Aside from perhaps towels.) And rightly so. But... how do you actually haul the blamed things about? 

A 10' pole is, after all, a whooping ten feet long. And presumably of a notable girth. Thus surely a bit heavy, too. A right bulky thing to move from A to B in the best of circumstances; I can only imagine how much more bothersome it'd be to carry in a tight, dark, dungeon, whilst being chased by some bastard of a grue. 

I myself regularly chop and haul wood, and I can assure you that even a measly six feet of the stuff is a bugger to operate with any degree of dexterity. I can't possibly imagine just strapping it to my back and strolling on unencumbered.

To say nothing of a 3' tall hobbit with a 7 in Strength trying to accomplish any of this.

So, my question is, how often do you take these inconveniences into account? Do they come up in your games? I imagine the most reasonable ruling would be to say characters need to hold the pole, and then presumably drop it in combat, depending on their weapon of choice.

There's also something to be said as to how this all relates to polearm weapons. Wouldn't they be a kill-two-birds-with-one-stick situation? But I think that's a bit of a tangent.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bdffcc50>,osr,1715401675.0

1hjb1le,Any Good Alternatives to Vancian Magic?,"I'm not very deep into the OSR yet but it seems like most games (especially the ones that are semi-retroclones) tend to use some version of Vancian magic. I know that some systems introduce the idea that spells can only be cast through one time use magic scrolls and I'm not really a fan of that either. I've tried both of those systems and I'm looking to find something a bit different.

Are there any OSR systems (or even just homebrew classes) that use a different kind of magic system than Vancian?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2be03fad0>,osr,1734791737.0
1hodakt,The Hole in the Oak: 7 deaths in 7 hours (play report),"Today I ran [The Hole in the Oak](https://necroticgnome.com/products/the-hole-in-the-oak) with 4 level 1 players. In 7 hours, there were 7 deaths. Yet they weren't totally inexperienced. I'd already played them a dozen OSE sessions, with perhaps 6 deaths, but I guess they weren't ready to tackle such a dangerous dungeon.

*(Spoiler alert do not read on if you intend to play the module)*

After visiting several very quiet rooms and killing a crab spider, they met the mutant ogre. After initiating dialogue, the orgre began to get angry and threatened to devour the group's elf. When the elf tried to flee, a fight broke out, which obviously went very badly (it's a 6+1\*HD creature). Two players made the mistake of fleeing to an undiscovered location. They came face to face with the 3 troglodytes who slaughtered them. The other two lured the ogre to the teleporter, who found himself transported to the bat cave.

**2 deaths**

Later, they discovered the bronze idol. Rushing to steal the chalice, they were attacked by 7 baby trees and, instead of fleeing, tried to hold on. That was really suicidal : they killed 7 of the 24 opponents, but only one PC survived by running away.

**3 deaths**

Then they approached the beach where the ghouls are. They killed the ghoul cut in two, then fled in a boat (there are 7 other ghouls, which is *a lot* for level 1s). But one of them was paralyzed and devoured on the beach. Bad luck.

**1 death**

A little further down the river, they climbed the bridge that led them to the Wight. They stole his sword and fled, but due to a random encounter they were sandwiched by fire beetles. One of them lost his life while the others managed to escape.

**1 death**

In 7 hours, they had lost 7 characters and found the dungeon not very balanced for level 1s. I thought they were tired of dying so often, but they enjoyed the game and are keen to continue.

They had certainly been overconfident in killing the crab spider during their 1st encounter, and were relying too much on their 19\~20 AC to get through. I explained to them that they were far too quick to resort to combat and that they needed to be much more careful. For the next session, they'll go back to town to rest, equip themselves and come back with multiple retainers.

They've already explored 27 of the 60 locations, wounded the Ogre and eliminated the fauns, but only found \~1000 gp. They still have to visit the lair of the giant lizards and meet the gnomes. Then, perhaps, if they survive, they'll look for a way to get rid of the enemies they've already encountered: the 7 ghouls, the shadow, the wight and the mutant ogre. Or maybe they'll all be killed by the gnomes and their magical tree stump.

Overall, it was a good game, but perhaps a little too action-oriented. Hard to argue with an ogre or man-eating fauns. I think it was a bit frustrating for them, but players will be all the prouder ***if*** they manage to finish the dungeon next time with fewer deaths.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2be046ea0>,osr,1735414427.0
1enpl2z,How do you handle players leaving their horses/mounts outside of dungeons?,"My players typically leave their mounts unguarded outside of a dungeon, perhaps hitched to a nearby tree or rock formation.

1h8u6ao,Rangers instead of Clerics,"I don't terribly like the B/X Cleric, but it does fill certain important niches in D&D (healing, WIS-based class, etc). The crazy idea I've had: replace Clerics with Rangers.

Reasons why:
-Lord of the Rings doesn't have anything resembling Clerics, but it does have Rangers who, amongst other things, heal and hunt evil (we have elves, Hobbits, etc; why not rangers?)

-Replace slightly world-breaking Vancian healing magic with herb-based limited healing from Rangers (maybe a percentile chance to cure poison and disease if the right herbs are on hand)

-Logical best armor is chainmail (and maybe not even shields?). Thus, the Fighter gets a real niche in terms of armor access

-Could be a class that naturally gravitated more towards Dexterity and archery to support the Fighter that gravitates toward Strength and melee

-Magic-Users get a real niche in being the only spellcasters

-Thief is a dungeon exploration expert; Ranger is a wilderness exploration expert (thematic counterbalance that doesn't interfere with fulfilling their roles; priests don't typically condone theft)

-Could have a role in facilitating group stealth outdoors in the same way Thieves can use Open Locks to facilitate group surprise against whatever monsters are in that room

-Could probably honestly flesh out wilderness exploration. It's a little odd how every character, regardless of class or level, has the same odds of getting lost outdoors in B/X

-Could redefine Wisdom to be more about being in-tune nature/surroundings and less about religion (maybe modifies reaction rolls with sentient, not sapient, creatures with WIS; maybe effects getting lost, etc)

-Rangers can actually shoot silver arrows, track undead across the forest, and emulate Van Helsing far more than Clerics can

-Rangers are much more archetypically neutral than mace-wielding crusader knights who specialize in repelling the undead through faith

-It is kind of silly that powerful, terrifying undead monsters run away screaming whenever the local priest pulls out his cross

The real question is which version of the Ranger across editions, retroclones, and homebrews would best fill this role. I don't know.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2be08cda0>,osr,1733583446.0

Does lethality decrease as characters become more powerful, or do the threats scale in a way that keeps things just as deadly? What kind of challenges do higher-level parties typically face? Do dungeons become more about puzzles, resource management, or political maneuvering rather than just avoiding instant death?

Probably due to the location very few of the players we get have any familiarity with B/X, most of them are new to to the hobby entirely. 

So I've decided in the next year to house rule the fuck out of it.

Probably going to use an injury and dying table. Modify or replace the magic user class entirely. Steal the Knacks mechanics from Populated Hexes. Maybe steal the luck mechanics from DCC. Slot based equipment maybe?

I’ve been running my first OSE campaign for awhile now and sure… level 1 and 2 can be pretty sketchy, but once the players get a few levels and have a decent amount of HP alongside a collection of magic items and scrolls and potions, it’s really not that deadly.  Survivability goes way up.

So many games don’t necessarily require you to get better as a player, but rather, you get better because the game makes you better!  Gives you more powers, more health etc… in Dark Souls (like the OSR) you only get better if YOU the player gets better!

1f2moow,My players did something crazy in Hole in the Oak (spoilers),"So they found the wizard's area where there is a scroll of diminution (which turns you into a 1 inch sized person if you read it). They were able to identify the scroll before reading it. 

They had encountered Ramius prior to this, and I played him up as a neckbeard basement dweller living with his ""concubine-wives."" They didn't like him, and managed to escape their initial encounter because they are very, very cautious. They came back later, left the scroll on his desk, and rang the bell.

Shortly after he waddles out, he reads the note and begins to shrink to a tiny person. Thanks to his now centimeters long leg span, he couldn't even cross the room before the players burst in and trapped him in a jar. He was not happy. 

They later, because they knock on doors politely, came across the mutagenic ogre (who doesn't mind adventurers, but really only hates theft), and sprung an idea. They decided to be door to door salesmen and SOLD TINY RAMIUS AS ""EXPANDING FOOD."" Much to Ramius' dismay, the ogre bought it, and ate tiny Ramius while some time later, his corpse expanded inside the ogres belly. He felt sick, and asked if they had anything the drink. 

THEY GAVE HIM THE PARALYSIS WATER. They had previously jarred some after testing out it's effects. He failed his save, and fell unconscious, and they promptly murdered him in his sleep. 

Not what I expected at all from the day's session. My mind was blown. This was the hardest they ever went into the OSR mindset. Usually, they want to fight things and feel powerful. But this time they solved the freaking dungeon like a puzzle. They left unscathed (well, one retainer was killed) and with tons of loot in tow, and plan to come back and jar some more paralysis water.

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses! I'm returning to B/X (used to play in the 80s) and wanted to run a game for my 5e players.

1c89g58,Recommendations heeded,"So a few weeks ago I asked for game recommendations because D&D 5e wasn’t working for me and my family. Wife and 9yr son. 
I got a lot of excellent suggestions 31 game systems mentioned. 
I refined my ask and mentioned some feedback I got from my wife. I got another round of great feedback and advice. 

So now I got on the Mausritter train and am going to run Honey in the Rafters later today. Spent yesterday and this morning rolling up some mice and flipping through the pdf with my kid. Set the expectation of a deadly game and we rolled an extra mouse in case the worse should happen. 

I had feared that mausritter was too much of a departure from D&D and classic fantasy that it wouldn’t go over well with my kid. 

I don’t know why I worried he is all over it. As we wait for mom to get home from work he is currently outside running around with a cardboard button shield and cardboard needle sword. Then with all of his animal facts from books and kid tv shows he really latched on to predators and was suggesting good animal bad guys for the mice to fight. 

I know we haven’t played yet and character death is all well and good until it happens to a kid. But I am really amped and excited for this to work. 

Thank you the r/osr community for taking the time to share and help me out. You have aided me introducing a new generation into the hobby. 
Hopefully after a few games with mom we can open the table to some school friends and it becomes a thing. 

UPDATE 
Ran session 1. Was super late start since my youngest child wouldn’t get to sleep. So we didn’t finish and had to leave the party in the dungeon. But we all had a blast and my kid was very pleased with himself since he managed to score some extra buckets of honey to barter with next session.

1c1x2md,"My players want to start a dairy farm, help!","**Context**: On days were the group I DM for can't all make it I decided to run a small dungeon crawl campaign, using World Without Number, where there is a town and a dungeon the party had found and decided to explore. Something simple that I can just run at the drop of the hat if need be with no other development then that... what could go wrong?

Well one of my players decided to read the entire list of things they could buy and saw that you could buy a cow for 10 SP. He asked if the cow would be a dairy cow, and I said yes not really thinking much of the question. Then the party decided they wanted to spend all the silver they have on buying cows, farmland, and pay for farmers to manage the cows and becoming rich selling the milk. Keep in mind I haven't even decided what setting this mini campaign takes place in I have literally just prepared the town and a few levels of the dungeon.

A few google searches later (and a lot of of sighs and face holding by myself) I decide on that a cow can produce 20 gallons of milk a week and each gallon is worth 3 SP a gallon. This is based on some very basic numbers I saw online (knowing nothing about dairy farming myself) and figuring 1 gallon of milk being worth triple a gallon of water made sense.

**Actual Question**: Not being someone who wants to railroad my players (and while I may have played up my frustration I am actually kind of curious where this could go) I have zero idea how to turn this into a ongoing campaign. Some ideas I had were things like securing the amount of cows they would want, dealing with ""rival"" dairy farms, and figuring out where and how they are going to sell their goods. I would love some input from the community however on how I can turn this into a fun and engaging experience!

&#x200B;

**Edit:** First off thanks to everyone who took the time to reply! I'm a little blown away by all the responses and again thanks to all the kind and thought out replies. I'll address a few of the common responses. 

First, while this definitely wasn't the idea I had for a ""backup"" game, I love it when players try and make a campaign their own thing even if its not something I would have ever thought they wanted to do! While I'll definitely make some changes to the margin on the cows, you've all given me ideas on how to challenge the players in their production of milk so it isn't just a get rich quick scheme!

Second, to the people concerned about my personal enjoyment of the game thanks for your concern! If this was something I had 0 interest in running I would absolutely either just put a stop to it, or have Drag'oon, Devourer of Cows swoop in and eat up their livestock! The idea of having the players want to run a business/farm is just something I haven't really encountered before and was curious how other people ran these type of ventures. 

Lastly, I never imagined I'd know as much about cows as I do now lol so thanks again for all the info!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2be2f0920>,osr,1712886761.0

At first glance, I'm a little disappointed that Ben Milton has done away with so much of the sleekness and simplicity of 1e. I found the static DC, simple combat and extra fragile characters all to be really fun in actual play.

What's the theory behind some of these changes?

Seems like 2e might better support longer wilderness exploration campaigns, but 1e is perfect for my mega dungeon and I will continue to use it.

I'm also curious how folks think 2e compares to other systems like Shadowdark, Cairn, B/X and Errant and how one goes about deciding which of these systems to run.

1bk2nk8,How much is too much player prep? Help me with a perspective on what I would call osr powergaming,"I've run an OSE campaign for the last six plus months. It is a generic sandbox based on a mix of Silveraxe and Brandonsford modules.

The issue I have now is that one of my players is quite, lets say educated. We are both somewhat new in terms of understanding the how to ""play"" OSR, but we've read articles. The general consensus is that your characters should have odds in their favor. So that's what my player does.

He literally spent the first three sessions from the campaign to set up shop, so to say. Gathered *every* info about anything regarding possible adventure sites. Befriended anyone he could in town, got discounts in shops, inn. Rounded up mercs and retainers. All good, he did all of this and I let him. I mean, why shouldn't I?

The issue itself is that this is a pattern that's frankly bleeding me dry. Especially when the group dropped into a new settlement and the cycle is starting again. In my head it has become a meme, because I try to twist his hand and have the NPCs demand more, but he destroys them WITH FACTS and LOGIC and CHARM. This goes about town relationships, combat composition,  dungeon delving. He's playing a game of competency porn.

All in all my grievances are: First, it's not fun for me to just be a chatgpt bot. Second, if I don't let players get what they want, I feel weird for blocking their honest (through roleplaying and knowledge) efforts. Third, I feel dumb, outsmarted, exploited and like I'm a shit DM that can't pose a good and fair (as in not being restrictive on purpose) challenge. 

I also forgot to mention - the group overall feels content. They seem happy to play, though sometimes push for some action to happen (cue Monthy Python's ""Get on with it!""), but generally are ok with the way things are. I am too, I guess, just confused if this is the way I envisioned an ""OSE campaign"" would be like. I guess I expected more cheesy classical fantasy tropes and less macro-managing.

Any pointers here?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2be386960>,osr,1711013918.0

* I had seen Undelved, the author of Cave of Cowardice, post works in progress pics of the project over the past few months, and I'm super excited to see that [**it is finally released**](https://undelved.itch.io/cave-of-cowardice). It's a system neutral adventure with amazing art and, perhaps more importantly, is generously hyperlinked, which makes it super easy to use in pdf form.
* [**Chrypt**](https://fedmar.itch.io/chrypt-english) is a pretty cool looking dungeon-crawling game built partially using Cairn. The pdf is designed to be easily printed in a charming A6 format, and it includes rules for procedural generation of dungeons.
* I don't see that many adventures for Dungeon Age, but the previously released [**Desert Angel Fiasco**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/322651/desert-angel-fiasco?affiliate_id=253473) is now available in print format. It's written for Cairn, 5e, and standard OSR versions, and looks like it does some interesting world-building.
* Eco Mofos, by Dave Blandy, is one of the cooler releases I saw come out in 2024, and there's been a ton of supplements released supporting it. One recent one I saw is by Roundup regular Jimmy Shelter, and is entitled [**Vehicle Rules for Eco Mofos**](https://jimmyshelter.itch.io/vehicle-rules-for-eco-mofos). Sweet, simple, and to the point.
* [**Nemesis Retribution**](https://ratwavegamehouse.itch.io/nemesis-retribution) is a slick little game that looks ideal for one shots or a session when the whole group can't make it. It's a game of enemies, dark counterparts, and all-consuming rivalries.
* I'm not familiar with Eidolon, but I just saw there is a [**2nd edition of the game**](https://reveal-your-master-plan.itch.io/eidolon2e) that was just released. It's got some neat artwork and interesting concepts that evoke Jojo's Bizarre Adventures and Persona.
* One of my personal favorite indie game designers is Tanya Floaker, and they've just released [**The Thunder Perfect Mind**](https://floaker.itch.io/the-thunder-perfect-mind), in which you play a revenant attempting to form a mystery cult with the goal of discovering what caused your untimely end and rectifying it. It's a work in progress available on itch.
* [**The Sin Eater** ](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/505744/the-sin-eater-a-solo-micro-crawl-across-a-doomed-universe?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473)is a new solo, rules-lite game in which you play the captain of a space vessel who failed in their mission to stop a galaxy destroying terror and have one last hope at saving humanity; constructing a parallel universe free from the creature.
* Richard Kelly has released [**Seven Strangers III**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/506097/seven-strangers-iii?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473), a class supplement for Cthork Borg. Richard always publishes some great material.
* I don't know how I missed this when it came out last week; the Welsh Piper is one of my favorite publishers, and their BX Options: Class Builder book is a classic. They've just released [**BX Options: Alternate Magicks**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/502304/bx-options-alternate-magicks?src=hottest_filtered&affiliate_id=253473), a weighty, 150 page book that introduces new spells, new spell-casting classes, a magical research system, rules for spell components, and more.
* There's only a few days left in the Kickstarter for [**Issue 41 of Populated Hexes Monthly**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thirdkingdom/populated-hexes-monthly-issue-41). This issue takes a dive into the Shadowlands, the place where souls journey after death, and explores the natives of this plane with a look at penumbrals. In BX-style D&D, shadows occupy a weird, non-undead place, and I decided they were the perfect starting place for the native inhabitants of the Shadowlands.

1gv6i0r,Favorite Initiative Systems ,"I have come to love side based initiative. Before using it I thought that it might get too confusing with all the players talking and trying to get their action in. But in actual play (with 4 players at least) it goes so smoothly and no one gets confused about who has done what or anything.

There are two things really pushed me over the edge to use side based initiative.

First, is that it is either the players turn, or the enemies turn. Both of which are important to the party and each individual player. There isn't really a time the players can afford to not pay attention.

Second, is that it easily allows for teamwork and coordinated/tandem tactics. If you want to lift a character up so they can climb on to a chandelier, you can both just do it when you act. No waiting around or fiddling with initiative to make it work.

One bonus reason I love it (which is the reason I considered it in the first place) is the seamless transition. One die roll and you're done, everyone knows everything they need to know about the initiative from that one roll.

All of these points come together perfectly in my opinion. I know it is nothing original or groundbreaking, but I really enjoy this initiative system and used it in my own system [Embark](https://infinite-fractal.itch.io/embark).

What is your favorite initiative system and why?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2be3e9190>,osr,1732046683.0
1ibdoph,Tips for Mega Dungeons,"Often when running dungeons, I find that floors turn into single encounters. The party might surprise a kobold, but the one that hears the fight alerts the wizard, who rings the bell, and a defense is organized. When a dungeon floor is a single map, even if very large like 50x50 squares, it is difficult to justify ringing steel and spellfire to go unnoticed by the intelligent and sentient denziens of the level.

Outside of very specific encounters: wizard in loud lab, undead bound to a room, unintelligent blobs, bugs, and skeleton, potted carnivorous plants and so on, many intelligent enemies will organize or flee unless the party is heavily committed to stealth and casting spells like ""silence.""

I am currently running a ""mega"" dungeon, which is really a series of encounter locations on different pages, spread so far apart as to make sound passing between them impossible. A cavern. A bridge. A ruin. A warrens. A river. It makes sense, and I was lucky to find many good maps.

But I've also recently run my share of ""all the goblins group up"" scenarios because they are largely unavoidable if that is the sort of enemy present.

When your goal is to create a long lasting dungeons delve experience, how do you put your maps together when you want the experience to make sense? What are your tips and tricks? It seems like the most common ""labyrinth of rooms"" full of intelligent enemies is the least likely to work without often playing dumb.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2be3f9580>,osr,1737996581.0
1j7wcu8,"OSR News Roundup for March 10th, 2025","Welcome to the second news roundup of March. My apologies to subscribers; I realized belatedly that I neglected to send out the newsletter last Monday. I had an immensely shitty day and it just got away from me.

I'm getting excited about the upcoming crowdfunding project I'll be launching in April for [**Mind Over Matter**](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/third-kingdom-games/osr-advanced-psionics?preview_token=nbbiRuFK64e), a psionics book for Old School Essentials and other OSR games. In addition to a fairly traditional psionics system, albeit one divorced from point-based activation, it will also include an adaptation of the classic Book of Nine Swords from late in the 3.5-era. I've always liked the concepts presented in that book, and I've reworked the rules to fit in with an OSR mindset and power scaling.

Enough about me, though. The big news from last week that I'm sure many of you have heard already is that Drivethrurpg will be raising prices on certain print on demand products, chiefly softcover books, some of which will see a price increase of up to 70%! I don't know yet how this will affect POD books from other vendors, or offset books from other sources, but it has been my experience that prices almost never *go down*. I hope that people who are in the middle of crowdfunding campaigns aren't negatively affected by the upcoming pricing increases, and for everyone else, I guess now is the time to purchase those POD titles that have been sitting in your cart.

* I've mentioned before my love of the games coming out of Latin America these days, and I was stoked to see that the [**LATAMjam 2025**](https://itch.io/jam/rpg-latam-jam-2025) is starting on March 12th. You don't have to be a LATAM creator to participate, so long as your entry uses a ruleset designed or released by an eligible publisher. The depth of creativity coming out of this community is truly astounding, and I'm excited to see what comes out of this game jam.
* Matt Kelly has released [**Stormalong**](https://bymattkelly.itch.io/stormalong), a collection of seafaring adventures for Cairn, Into the Odd, and other systems, all based on American folktales.
* [**Scouts and Scoundrels**](https://writer-ben.itch.io/scouts-and-scoundrels) is a free, rules-lite rpg based on Cairn, with some super cute artwork.
* I've mentioned [**Block, Dodge, Parry** ](https://dicegoblingames.itch.io/block-dodge-parry)several times, and was excited to get the notification that the final version is out on itch. It's designed as an ""advanced"" companion to Cairn, and is available now for a lower price before it jumps up to the regular price. I've been following the development, and it's a really neat system in its own right, and in my opinion really brings a shine to the (fairly basic) Cairn.
* [**Vesta Mandate**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/storygames-chicago/vesta-mandate) is a neat-looking game of political intrigue in the future that is currently funding on Kickstarter.
* Vaults of Vaarn has a soft spot in my heart, and I just saw that [**Ecophage**](https://chaotic-goods.itch.io/ecophage) is a newly released adventure for VoV, dealing with an escaped scientific experiment causing havoc.
* I've mentioned before that Goblin Errands is one of Sabre's bestselling titles, and I just saw there's a similar (perhaps a bit darker) project funding on Kickstarter: [**Rob'n Goblin**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spielknights/robn-goblin) is a heist game which looks to be a bit of Honey Heist mixed with Goblin Errands mixed with the newly released Dawn of the Orcs ([**which we have in stock!**](https://www.sabregamesandcards.com/product-page/dawn-of-the-orcs-lyme-and-plasmophage))
* Out of all the various Borgs, Pirate Borg is perhaps my favorite, and I just saw there's a newly release [**Ancient Mariner class**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/513265/ancient-mariner-pirate-borg-class?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473) available.

It's a well-respected OSR zine, and in addition to new gaming content this issue also features an interview with Tracy Hickman.
* Explore Dungeons have released [**Heroic Adventures #1**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/499644/heroic-adventure-1-evil-never-dies?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473), an adventure written for DCC revolving around a lich and its rule over a helpless town.
* [**Attack the Light Issue #0**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/514560/attack-the-light-issue-0?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473) is the flagship offering of a new series of zines by Michael Putlack, written for Shadowdark. I had the pleasure of interviewing Michael several years ago for a project they launched for ZineMonth, and it's cool seeing them continuing to publish product (full disclosure, Michael currently works for the Arcane Library, publisher of Shadowdark).
* I've mentioned before how much I like seeing a product that I've mentioned in the promotional stages make it to publication, and I just saw that [**Miami 86**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/513847/miami-86-rpg?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473) is live on Drivethru.

\- Warrior feats/exploits (DCC, LFG).

1c6fk3g,Where do I find OSR resources without the Gonzo?,"Hello referees,

I'm preparing to run a hexcrawl campaign this summer, and I've been reading up on the OSR philosophy. There's a lot that I like here - the emphasis on player creativity, exploration & experimentation, and prep streamlining through random tables. But what I just can't acquire a taste for is all the Gonzo stuff. I keep looking for random tables or other materials I can plunder for table content, but I keep finding stuff that feels, to me, tonally dissonant.

What I'm trying to run is something more grounded. Faction intrigue, levers being pulled. The party being manipulated by the forces that be, if they don't figure it out. I've made provisions for that high fantasy flair - the hexcrawl will be taking place in an area of intense magic that will allow weirder monsters and people out of place (or time) - but I still want it to feel grounded. I want things to have reasons to be there. I don't want a skateboarding orc to show the party how to shred, or goofy wandering merchants with robes full of dollar store gag gifts.

What sources of random tables and adventures would you recommend for someone going for a grounded, quasi-realism vibe? Any tips for running a hexcrawl?

So like, am I missing stuff? Is there some hidden trove of weird west OSR content that I've simply never heard of, or am I the only one who wants this stuff?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2be4a03b0>,osr,1727914824.0
1e83mo2,7 people just RSVP'd to your OSR game tomorrow morning... what are you running?,"Obviously my current situation lol. Players invited friends and the number's jumped from 3 to 7. Many of them have never played an RPG before. I'm excited and want everyone to have a good time.

What would you run?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2be4ebef0>,osr,1721504000.0
1frdoms,Just One Torch - A Solo OSR Toolkit,"After many long years of playing and tinkering with solo games and my preferred style, I have put together a toolkit of some of my favorite oracles and systems to help people play OSR RPG's using just one player: [Just One Torch!](https://onetorch.itch.io/just-one-torch)

This toolkit includes:

1. Updated character creation rules
2. A short list of moves to provide opportunities for ""soft"" GM intervention or manipulation to make the game more tense or exciting, but are not necessary for play.
3. Sources of inspiration like Shawn Tomkin's excellent Action+Theme Oracles from [Ironsworn](https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn) (used with permission under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0), Necropraxis' Hazard Die, Twist mechanics from [FORGE](https://zap-forge.itch.io/forge) by Oliver Fradgley, and travel moves inspired by The Angry GM.
4. New combat mechanics that take a different approach than the classic ""1 hit can auto-kill multiple 1 HD enemies"" where the damage you receive is modified, but the damage you deal is not. This makes it harder to kill you, but also harder for you to kill your enemies, helping to retain the OSR feel
5. Encounter tables that will help you design encounters on the fly that are appropriate for your level, but not necessarily survivable if you decide to slug it out
6. A d66 Dungeon Design set of rules that helps you explore a dungeon as you go, along with a huge list of random tables gathered from here on reddit to help fill in the dungeon

This is a **free** toolkit published under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 so feel free to grab what you want for your own inspirations!

Games that are playable with this toolkit: *Basic Fantasy RPG, Old School Essentials, ShadowDark,*

1gerzu9,3d6 Down the Line Amuse-bouche! Shadowdark RPG | The Wavestone Monolith!,"Mike takes the game master chair for the first of our Amuse-bouches: a series of small one-, two-, and maybe three-shot jaunts to showcase other independent RPGs we're interested in playing!

First up is the much-lauded Shadowdark RPG, by The Arcane Library! It's known in TTRPG circles as the perfect transition for D&D 5e players into the OSR. Mike sets up a Kelsey Dionne-designed eldritch scenario steeped in seashells, tentacles, leeches, and a dark ziggurat!

And more importantly, why is it your favorite? Is it the vibe? The memorable NPCs? The ease of use for the GM? Etc.? ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2be525ca0>,osr,1713363532.0
1bwthgy,The “Weird” part of OSR Dungeons: am I thinking too hard about this?,"I keep referring back to a Goblin Punch blog post made in 2016 titled “Dungeon Checklist” when trying to make dungeons. A part of the checklist is called, “Something to experiment with”, which the post explains it as things that are “the unexplainable, the weird, and the unknown” and makes the dungeon special by making “the thing” unique. The blog gives examples like:

- a sundial that controls the sun
- Two holes in a wall that swaps limbs
- A machine that turns products into raw goods and goods into ammunition
- A metal skeleton that can talk if a skull is placed on it

Everytime I look at this blog, I’m kind of confused. It talks about these things recontextualizes the dungeon or gives out new win conditions for combat and obstacles, but what constitutes as a “weird” thing? When I try and build dungeons with these in mind, the things I make are kind of lame, and I always think I’m missing the boat.

- A cup that stays in place if there is wine in it
- A paintbrush that can copy the color of something given a command word
- A door that doubles the weight of anything that is walked through it
- A lasso that kites clouds but it’s only 30 feet
- A ladder that if used, you grow in size (can you reverse it by climbing down?)
- A golem that works only if coins are inserted in it, but the coins it needs are all gone?

I’m definitely not asking if these are good items, because I know these aren’t. Am I thinking too hard about this? What are some better examples to help make sense of this phenomenon?

EDIT: Just wanted to say thank you all for saying your piece about this stuff! I appreciate everyone sharing insight, and while I do find it confusing, when it shows up in the right way, it’s one of the most interesting parts of the dungeon experience. Awesome stuff everyone!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2be52cda0>,osr,1712352064.0
