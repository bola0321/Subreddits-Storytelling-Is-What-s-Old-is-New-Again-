1jf385e,So what ARE the rarest and/or most valuable RPG products today?,"Following on from u/SwimmingOk4643's [excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1jdr89q/for_those_who_own_several_rpgs_in_print_what/) from the other day, it's left me thinking...

What *are* the rarest RPG products out there? I mean things that really became a product. I have the utmost respect for someone's ashcan zine that they photocopied 20 copies of and sold at a con one time, but that's not the sort of thing I'm thinking about. Real books or boxed sets. What are the gems that you fall asleep at night hoping that you find on a used book shelf?

Simultaneously, what are the products that routinely and actually fetch high dollar amounts on the secondary market? Again, not just whatever price some bozo slapped on a book on eBay, but what people actually and readily pay?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17e9740b0>,rpg,1742407053.0
1jf381h,"Song of the River Prince, a rules-lite TTRPG, now live on Kickstarter","*The Riverlands teem with life as the tributaries froth, the branching streams babble, frogs croak their solemn cry and birds chitter along the shoreline. This is the River Prince’s song, and it is all around you.*

*Everyone has a story to tell along the Riverlands. Rafts carrying goods to the far-off cities to the south bring news from the mountains from which the rivers are born. Merchants venture from the cities seen in the far distance to ply their trades along the docks as pontoon boats make landfall at sunset. Children scream in peals of laughter that echo through the deep valleys  as they run through the long grass. This is the River Prince’s song, and it is all around you.*

*Here too there is mystery, love, and danger. A cloaked man passes a note to a boat captain, ordering the assassination of a merchant in the city of Estuary. A young woman swims across the river to meet in secret with her lover on the other side, against her mothers’ wishes. A barge catches fire just as it turns a corner, entering a dock-filled village, putting the whole settlement in danger. This, too, is the River Prince’s song. It is all around you.*

*What will your story be? What song will the River Prince sing for you?*

Song of the River Prince is a self-contained roleplaying game built on a streamlined, intuitive system that lets you begin playing within minutes. It includes dedicated rules for navigating the rivers and streams of the Riverlands, introducing dynamic twists and obstacles along your journey. Detailed downtime mechanics invite you to explore each settlement’s activities and culture, encouraging meaningful interactions between adventures. The book showcases six distinct towns scattered across the Riverlands—each with its own festivals, seasonal weather patterns, and vibrant communities—alongside random tables for shaping your travels, compelling adventure hooks, memorable NPCs, unique wildlife, and tantalizing rumors to uncover.

1jf2f04,Your TTRPG suggestions,"Hi all,

I have been tossing around an idea for a campaign of a non-magic world where a meteor strikes and the fragments of that meteor can be the fuel for magic/alchemy/magic items. The world would be, technology-wise, at the usual place most fantasy settings are, sans magic. Bows and arrows, swords and armor, etc.

The plan would be that the players are prisoners who are being sent to explore the land where the meteor hit under the watchful eyes of their captors. But their ship is attacked and wrecked by an ""impossible"" creature. i.e. fantastic. and they manage to survive and make it to the island.

I want a system that relies on skills, has the capability of magic but can be without it. A great crafting system would also be good as I am envisioning this as a survival game to start but eventually the players grow enough in power to rise up against their captors.

Please let me hear your advice for a system(s) or if you need more details from me.

My group is performing a Friday evening show at C2E2. Where we do an improv show and then throw random RPG rules at the performers to change the narrative (Dice, Jenga Tower/Dread, etc)

We were thinking of making a Deck of Many Things built out of suggestions from Redditors.

So, if you're interested, what would you like to include in our Deck of Many Things that will AFFECT the Character who pulls it while also kinda sounding like an RPG character trait OR just weird.

Such as:

The Fates: Your backstory has changed, you now have a German Accent  
Balance: Your alignment changes...geometrically. You must perform lying down.  
Throne: You get a plus 5 to persuasion checks if you bring up the TV show Castle which you own on DVD.

If your card is drawn we will credit your username (IF YOU WISH) and tag you in show photos (IF YOU WISH)

NOTE: We are rolling for some decisions, so + and - to skills/situations are in play.

I want to make an enemy's HP a low number, and base their defeat on how many successful checks the PCs can make. Damage in this game doesn't always mean they get shot or struck with a weapon, but when they are the damage is constant, and doesn't fluctuate except on rare occasions. 

BUT! Most everyone loves rolling dice, getting big handful of them and adding up bonuses to deal loads of damage, but that gets tedious and can drag the game's flow down at times.

Consistent damage is simple and clean but may not give the same excitement, requiring the GM or players to spice up the narration of combat.

1jexoco,OSR games are deadly—great! But are they fair?,"Yo good Peeps of Earthfordshire!

Jimmi here from [Domain of Many Things](https://www.domainofmanythings.com/) serving up my weekly ponderings, for your consumption and pleasure 😁 This week - getting new players into the OSR.

In my experience, old-school play thrives on danger ☠️ but I've found a real issue persuading people who've joined the hobby via 5e and stayed there to try it out, because they feel like their characters are doomed from the start, and won't have satisfying stories to tell.

**Fair play to them if they really don't want to explore the wider TTRPG hobby, but there's a whole other world outside that gated 5e garden, just waiting for em.**

A good OSR game can be brutal for sure, but it should also be fun, engaging, and give players a fighting chance - if they're smart.

In my latest bloggadowndiddlydoo, I dig into what makes OSR challenges feel *fair* rather than frustrating  (and also use faaaar too many Matt Mercer gifs). I'm talking about empowering players to balance risk, giving them real choices, and making sure every death tells a story rather than just feeling like a dice-flavored slap in the chops.

If you love running OSR games, and want to bring new people into the niche whilst keeping the spirit of your games deadly *without* making players throw their dice across the room, check it out here:

1jevqly,How Do You Respectfully Talk About Veteran Game Preparedness and Experience?,"Tldr: How do you talk about personal game experience and preparedness as an experienced DM without sounding like a tool?

Not really 'table troubles' because it hasn't caused personal conflict, but it that doesn't mean it won't one day!

Without specifics, Im an avid ttrpg player that owns a couple dozen systems in print and many, many game supplies. Probably the biggest game prepared player in my local 50 mile area, or easily top 3. Imagine a serious 'Rate my RPG setup' type post, right.

How do equally prepared DMs talk about their games to players who are entrenched in systems like 5e or people who are just starting as well? Specifically players you're trying to recruit and such? Any time I talk about trying to help DMs I'm playing with or players I'm trying to recruit for a non-5e game or otherwise, it sounds like I'm gloating. Stuff like;

'Hey, you don't need to hack 5e to play a superhero game. Would you like to look at a couple superhero rpgs I have?'

'Wow that's a cool character. I'd love to assemble and paint them using all of my Frostgrave and Oathmark bits.'

'Yeah, I'd love to DM for you guys, I've been playing for (x) years with so many different systems' 

'If anyone needs (specific) miniature(s) I'd be happy to lend a few I already or paint some if you needed it!'

 ""My steak is too juicy, my lobster is too buttery"" type problem. It's stupid. It's not created problems for me, but I feel pompous and inhibited whenever the opportunity presents itself.

1jer5fk,Is there a game like this out there?,"I'm mainly a DnD 5e player, but I've branched out to other things, and love Shadowrun/Cyberpunk RED/Delta Green as well. However lately I've been looking for more games to try out with my group, here's what I'm looking for and my problems:

I want a game (ideally medieval fantasy adjacent, but anything goes) that does the following:

1. Has some kind of grid or mini based combat
2. Is more narrative friendly than 5e/Pathfinder and rewards more RP or Exploration etc...
2. Combat is less grindy/difficult than 5e (Not necessarily rules light but ideally avoiding 2-3 hour long combats)
3. Lends itself to cool narrative moments, flavorful actions, mechanics related to non-combat stuff (xp for traveling or RP encounters, etc...)
4. Is NOT player facing. Don't know if that's the correct term, but whenever I've seen someone ask about a more ""narrative"" game everyone recommends PbtA games, which is decidedly not what I want. I want an experience that still has that GM / Player divide, where the GM sets the story and players don't have to improv scenes or new characters into the world on the fly

Overall I really like the _Idea_ of PbtA but every one of those RPGs lose me when the players have to come up with characters, scenes, etc... on the fly, that is very much not what my group and I want, we still want a similar experience to DnD where the GM narrates almost everything, the players only really have agency over their own actions not the world itself.

Games that have called my attention so far based on that is stuff like Dragonbane, Tales from the Loop, Draw Steel (MCDM RPG), Pendragon, and Daggerheart. However several of those are not fully out yet, so my question is, are there any other games you could recommend along those lines based on the above?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17eb32540>,rpg,1742367574.0
1jeqhcy,Looking for a System,"i've had an idea in my head for a while now, and im trying to find a system that can help support it. i've already thought about GURPS and HERO system (in fact, learning about GURPS is partially what inspired the idea), i havent counted them out or anything, i was just wondering if there was anything better since im going to learn a new system no matter what.

the idea comes from some of the many MMORPG type light novels that are all over the place. i love mastery systems where using a skill more makes it more powerful. my thought was to sort of reverse it though so failing the roll will earn the experience as you learn more from failure.

the idea in my head is kind of a kitchen sink type system. i want to emulate/model/make abilities based on all kinds of things: devil fruit powers from one piece, zanpaktou from bleach, naruto ninja abilities, to mistborn powers from brandon sanderson, to world of warcraft abilities. like, they wouldnt start as powerful as the source material, but you can train them up and invest in them to make them more powerful. other inspirations for abilities: death mage who doesnt want a 4th time, overgeared, the beginning after the end, reincarnated with the strongest system (a bunch of isekai and regressor trash that i absolutely adore, especially if it gives MC a stat screen)

the reason i started to doubt GURPS was because i kept reading things about how it starts to break down the further from grounded realism you get, and this crazy idea of mine wouldnt stay there very long... HERO sounds like it might be the fit? the only TTRPG i've played is D&D and i know thats very far from what im looking for... idk maybe this is too ambitious or just a bad idea. but i thought i'd check what cool games are out there that could help!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17eb33260>,rpg,1742364497.0

1jepxdg,Running a (AD&D)spelljammer-esque game in a modern system?,"Hey folks,

A few months ago I got into Troika!. It's a fun system, very lightweight OSR thingy (my first contact with OSR actually, so a nice way to get into it), and the ""making the lore up as you go"" philosophy along with the strong weird science-fantasy vibe made the game feel really unique to play.

Troika has no official lore, only snippets you and your table glue together as you go. Over time, the snippets combined into a campaign pitch: The players have an aether-faring vessel, but are stuck in a region of space because of a powerful space dragon (details To Be Worked On™). I then read a good chunk of the AD&D spelljammer books for inspiration, and yeah, that is really the vibe I'm going for.

Now, my problem is that I am no longer sure I want to do that campaign in Troika. I envision a game with a little bit of a heroic/epic feel (alongside the usual comedy that so many games usually devolve into) that I am not 100% sure Troika is suited for. My two gripes are a) I still have trouble running OSR games, they are not intuitive to me eg. I am afraid to kill player characters and I don't know how much/if I should help them for numerical progress; and b) Troika is designed with very simple, chaotic combat in mind, whereas I actually enjoy a bit more tactics. If I do run it in Troika, It's likely I will stitch together a simple ship tactical combat system from old spelljammer stuff and some troika community resources, but I don't know if I should also want more tactical combat for player combats.

So I guess my question is, do you think Troika is a system suited for that sort of stuff? If so, How do I handle longer campaigns in OSR-style games, where death is supposedly always on the table, but characters are still supposed to progress? And if not, what system would be better suited for that sort of campaign?

1jeoqf5,I just can’t get into Shadowdark or OSR style games no matter how much I’ve tried.  Am I alone?,"I have been playing “D&D” since the early 80s. I had the red box, the wax pencil for my dice, the whole experience. I know I never really played by the rules because I was 10 or 11 when I started, but I didn’t care. It was awesome. I got into MSH/Faserip, Star Frontiers, and more. I played solo before it was cool. As the decades passed I played each new addition of D&D and since TTRPGs have exploded in popularity I have Kickstarted and picked up TONS of indie and third party games. 

Unlike many I actually liked 4e but hated the massive power bloat and sky high ACs and HP. 5e was a nice compromise of crunch and simplicity. Still, I was always searching for something else. 

Index Card RPG was a revelation for me. It opened my eyes two ways of playing Dungeons & Dragons that I hadn’t thought of. Basically it was permission to change the rules and make the game easier and faster which I was a fan of. It also made me search out some old school style games. I tried OSE but remembered I hated THAC0. Old Swords Reign was fine. I checked out Castles and Crusades and more. So when I heard about Shadowdark, which was heavily influenced by ICRPG’s creator, I jumped right in.

I KS’d the whole package, all the zines and the DM screen. I was excited about a faster and easier version of “D&D”. The enthusiasm faded as I looked at the classes and options and found them to be very bland and boring. The fact that mechanically you can’t make a fighter much different from every other fighter in the world was annoying. I wanted low HP I wanted fast combat but I also wanted to play an actual hero not a barely competent villager for three or four levels. The game is well-made for certain and seems to be well-loved, but I just cannot get excited to play the PCs. I REALLY wanted to like it but I’ve had the books for years now, I’ve made a few PCs, watched a hundred videos about how great it is and I still can’t get it to the table. 

I’m frustrated and curious if anyone else has gone though this same experience? I keep going back to 5E with some homebrew. But every few weeks I stare at my Shadowdark stuff, wishing it had more to offer. Wondering what I’m not getting. I played old school D&D and I guess my tastes and preferences have grown up? I am not a min max’er at all, but I guess want neat things my PC gets to do. I don’t want to run from Goblins for 2-3 levels, I want to be a hero. Not a superhero, but someone that can do cool stuff. I feel like there just aren’t a lot of games in the gap between OSR and 5e/PF2e. I have ZERO desire to play past 7th-10th level in any RPG, but I want to enjoy 1st-3rd. 

EDIT: almost everyone’s been really cool in their replies, but I wanna make clear. I don’t think Shadowdark a bad game, at all. I appreciate the kind words because seriously I’ve gotten emotional and frustrated over this and just needed to share!

The TLDR is I really wanted to like it and I still wish I could get into it but I feel like I’ve changed too much over the years and I don’t wanna play that kind of game anymore and I’m bummed because it seems like I should like it and I’ve spent a lot of money on it.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17ed26c90>,rpg,1742357466.0

1jegq6z,Invincible or Superhero TTRPG,"So im making a session for this weekend, only its set in the world of Invincible. I want to use as many of the classic D&D rules as I possibly can just so that we don't have to spend a ton of time being confused learning new mechanics. My thought was to keep pretty much everything the same in regards to role-playing and travel and what not. The only thing I'm a little confused on is how I'm going to tackle the class system.
My thought was to make my own small set of classes, obviously superhero power based, and then make my own 2 to 3 sub classes inside of that class very similar to DND, but with my own rules and stuff. To make things even more unique, every few levels I will let them choose from a list of unique powers that only their hero has, and once they make that choice, that power every few levels as I said, will unlock more abilities. Does this sound fairly simple but doable?

As you may know, invincible is very fast paced, and very violent, so I was also seeking advice on how you would operate with combat, I plan on doing it pretty much the same way, but some characters are gonna be flying a lot and they have very high speed attacks, and some characters are obviously gonna have to have very powerful unarmed strikes and that kind of thing. But what else might you do to alter it? Again, I wanna keep it as close as possible while also bringing that fast pace, violent superhero fun. This is gonna be a trial run so if something doesn't work, we can always adapt, but like I said, I'm really just making my own sub classes and classes and I'm gonna have to put some work into Creating my own abilities for them. Any advice would be super awesome

EDIT, if a new games systems would benefit me more, which would be the easiest to understand or closest to DND? I feel like its really just making my own classes and combat that would need to be overhauled ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17eda7e90>,rpg,1742333958.0

I was thinking about exploring starfinder and kind of changing things to be more planet focused, but I wasn't sure if there was a better system that had the whole gunslinging/vehicular combat/low magic already all laid out?

For those unfamiliar with the Tales of the Ketty Jay book, it could be equated to Firefly except they stay on one planet.  

* Technology levels are early 1900s with airships, fighters and various other modes of transportation and airship/vehicular combat is a big thing with ship roles.
* Combat is largely martial with firearms and melee
* Magic is handled through thralling daemons to enchant things rather than directly channeling any magic, but the setting is generally low magic.

1jef6ro,"Rules for abstracted, large scale war strategy","I will soon be running a game where the players become generals over a military conflict. They will be tasked with choosing how to use the military resources, what units to deploy on what fronts etc.

At the same time, they will be joining some of these battles themselves as elite units to secure special objectives, more akin to normal TTRPG sessions, infiltrating dungeons, fighting enemies 1 on 1 etc.

For this latter part, I will be using Lancer. However, I am looking for abstracted rules for the large scale part. Something less involved with positioning and terrain like wargames (e.g. warhammer), but where there's still interesting choices to be made for the players.

A stand can be built by taking an Edge (X dots = X Paths), selecting its paths and then building it with the dots of the Major path and the other minor ones.

The stand gimmick can be easily made with Aberrant rules for Quantum Powers or The world Below rules for Wild Kaos.

Each path of the Stand gives dots, but you can't have new paths unless you create an ACT Stand.

If the Stand has more than 5 dots on the attribute, then make it an advantage like Mega-Edges/Mega-Attributes.

They start experiencing memories of being the witches and, by the end of the game, they realize that they are on some level reincarnations of the witches drawn here to end the ritual and reunite with themselves. A big part of the one shot is gonna be these flashbacks where the players are being made to play the witches.

I love some advice on how to run the flashbacks/ how to DM the players in a way that makes them confident playing characters that aren't theirs. I have 17 flashback scenes prepped in total for a session thats gonna be around 6 hours (3 for each of 5 players and then 2 scenes that incorporate the whole group). They are meant to be on the shorter side (a few minutes per scene) but I feel like it could still be too much time wise. The other thing I'm kinda worries about is just the players not taking enough initiative in doing things during the flashbacks.

1je690l,Fleshing out the concept of a druidic crime syndicate in a big city,"I have been fascinated by the idea of a druidic crime syndicate in a big city. The concept of urban druids has existed since *D&D* 3.5, and for all I know, they may have appeared even earlier than that.

Animals receive plenty of leeway in a metropolis: all the cats on the rooftops, the birds on the windowsills, the dogs wandering the slums or being walked around by the two-legs. Assuming a generic fantasy city (as opposed to, say, an arcology-city with mile-high towers, like Sharn), horses draw the wagons of the poor and the carriages of the wealthy. Then there are the ""undesirables,"" such as rodents and arthropodal pests.

Someone who can talk to such creatures has many sources of intel and blackmail. Someone who can transform into beasts has myriad avenues of infiltration, burglary, espionage, and assassination; imagine a druid posing as a pet. A homeless druid can simply sleep as a cat, a bird, or some other innocuous animal. Of course, there cannot be too many criminal druids in the city, or else people would get paranoid around animals.

A little higher up in the druidic power scale, and we have plant-speakers. Cities have flora, too. Most people scoff at the idea that a flower pot on a windowsill, or a tree just outside of the window, could be turned into a spy against them.

How do you think such a druidic crime syndicate would have started in the first place? How would they reconcile druidism with being a criminal syndicate in a big, bustling city?

I’m curious about role-playing games that were massive in their home countries—so much so that they overshadowed global giants like D&D, Call of Cthulhu, or Vampire.

It’s a dark, medieval-inspired fantasy RPG set in a world called Ynev, full of powerful gods, magic, political scheming, and constant wars. It was the dominant RPG here, with a huge cultural impact, spawning tons of novels, short stories, and supplements.

I love my partner, very much. He's been working on a game for several years, after taking a break for 5 years, and has a cool concept and setting. (At least, I think so.) Thing is, he's changed the system several times.  Just recently,  we had a session 0, where we worked through making characters. And he realized,  it was too much...

Some background:

He's played TTRPGs for... 40 years (starting as a kid), never really played D&D.  He's played GURPS, Rolemaster, Hero, those type games. He was also a GM for many years, so it's not like he's new to this.  He likes D100 and Skill based systems.

I've been playing TTRPGs for 25 years (started in my 20s), and have played D&D (AD&D 2nd, 3.5, and 5) as well as Pathfinder (1st).  I've never played any of the super crunchy stuff.

We have a 3 other players who have played D&D for years, and one who has never played anything,  but has been around D&D before.

I'm happy to learn a new game, and now own several, shiny new hardcover books. But I need him to pick something!!  

Here is what hasn't made the cut: Runequest, Against The Dark Master, Mythras, anything Modiphius (I played 2 game sessions of the Dune game, and HATED it), and just recently Harnmaster. I know there are others...

He has commented on how a Universal System might be cool.

He recently looked at Barabrians of Lemuria

Now, we are watching YouTube Videos on Savage Worlds (something he has, in the past, rejected).

...

TLDR:
So, my fellow TTRPG people, here is my ask.  

I need a system that is:
1. Skill based
2. D100 (roll over or under)
3. Universal 
4. Only slightly crunchy 
5. Easy to learn
6. Happy to support small businesses and independent Creators.

Also,  I know he's in the sub, so be nice. 

Thanks!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x17ef30cb0>,rpg,1742265749.0

1jduewl,"Does a gamified TTRPG exist? Gloomhaven looks too solved, Earthborn Rangers looks goodish.","I want to play a ttrpg, even DM one, with my friends but D&D leaves too much off the table.

I need travel rules (and maybe a map?)

I need item prices

I need weather mechanics

and an action economy for how to spend a day.

I want my players to have some physical things to play with. Some metal coins and such.

I don't care about leveling up, I don't care about building a wizard beyond ""You have a fire spell"".

It seems like the board gaming community and the ttrpg community should have made a baby by now. I guess Gloomhaven? But it appears fairly combat heavy, and I'm more into politics and resources. Earthborne Rangers looks cool but looks more like a deck builder, and is it really a D&D replacement? Has anyone frankensteined some boardgames together with success?

1jdqmqi,He's Dead Jim!,">OpenD6

>Originally OpenD6 was published by West End Games. It has changed hands a few times over the years until eventually being digitally published for free. OpenD6 is a universal system with three independent Core Rulebooks. They are ""D6 Fantasy"", ""D6 Adventure"", and ""D6 Space"". Each contains all of the rules and systems you need to play in a variety of settings and you can even mix and match elements to create your own genre mashups. The system is easy to learn and play, using only common six-sided dice. Each of the D6 books also comes with a great introductory section with a choose-your-own-style solo adventure, designed to teach a new player how to play OpenD6 and RPGs in general.

>OpenD6 was also simplified into a lighter weight and easier to consume, and still free, version named MiniSix. MiniSix breaks the rules down into roughly 11 pages, with the remaining 30 pages containing sample characters and settings as well as a guide for using OpenD6 content with the simpler set of rules.

I already have these as PDFs, and like the chassis they're built on for their respective merits. 

However, I really like character feats to truly make your PCs unique and individual. My first RPG experience happened to be D&D 3.5, and I loved how crazy and singular characters could become, purely based on feat selection.

I am least familiar with DCC, and I feel Dragonbane gives out Powers a little less frequently than I'd like. Of these three, which system do you feel has the most colorful and interesting, the widest breadth ofcharacter feats?

1jdqe4y,Anyone encountered a good time loop [one shot/campaign/system]?,"A time loop RPG seems like an interesting way to both enable player agency (because they can try things multiple ways) and also reward GM prep (because you can reuse the same material across multiple explorations).

In particular, I've been thinking about how NPC interactions might differ. In my linear campaigns, I feel that NPCs are often only there for a single scene while the players get what they need out of them. A loop would let players probe the NPC with different approaches, or see how they act when the players leave them alone.

I've only run a time loop once, as an improv one shot. I'm curious if anyone knows of premade one shots that do it well. Even more curious if there's a whole premade campaign structured around this, as I'm very curious to see how it's organized and what level of depth is provided. E.g. how do you present prep that has meaningful opportunities for causality while still being open to player choice.

The thing I'm most curious about is: has anyone designed a system that's purpose-built for running time loops? Because I feel like a lot of player progression and GM prep decisions would be warped by the time loop structure.

I've been developing my homebrewed 40k setting for a bit now, and to my surprise, it has garnered interest from other GMs I've discussed it with. Because of this, I've decided to expand on it and write an unofficial setting/campaign supplement for Imperium Maledictum and other 40k TTRPGs.

1jdkrfd,Developing TTRPGs and would like feedback,"Hello all! I'm not sure if this is the right sub to post this in, but hoping maybe someone can point me in the right direction.

I've been playing TTRPGs for about 4 years now. I started with D&D, but often felt limited as a player and confused as a GM. I found a group of people who played non-D&D TTRPGs which allowed me to explore other systems. Then, I started digging deeper into the mechanics of TTRPGs, how to design a game, etc. I designed a one-page hack for a Game Jam on [itch.io](http://itch.io) last year and while challenging, I loved the experience.

I've been working on a long project developing a game since September of last year, and I'm ready for some feedback. My problem is that for reasons that haven't been explained to me, the group I was playing games with before seems unwilling or incapable of providing feedback to me--I asked back in January when I had the second draft ready, and got some responses in the affirmative, but haven't actually \*received\* the feedback.

As anyone might feel in this situation, I'm feeling a bit impatient and wanting to do what I can to make sure I keep things moving where I can. ""When one door closes,"" and all that. If anyone can point me in the right direction, I'd greatly appreciate it. Discord groups, other subreddits, other tools I'm not aware of, etc. as I'm pretty inexperienced in this whole process.

I've been using a few systems to run my historical campaigns. I've found some decent options. But I'm wondering if there's a more appropriate option.

I like to run historical campaigns. They're often no-fantasy or low-fantasy. I like to move to different time periods all roughly encompassed by the middle ages and the dark ages. Roughly from 600 to 1400.

I'm kind of looking for a ruleset that's not too heavy, doesn't strictly focuses on fighting, supports mass battles or larger groups at least. Preferably not heroic in nature or power level.

It's a plus if the system is easy to hack.

1jdi7vn,Looking for advice on switching systems.,"
My Lancer group has recently decided they don't actually enjoy the mech combat as much as the narrative.
Unfortunately the narrative system suffers from the game design expectation that it would only be about 10% of the total gameplay, meaning it is a bit too skeletal for me to enjoy running a whole campaign in it.

SO
I'm looking into new systems to shift over to. 
I want to go with something Powered by the Apocalypse, but I haven't found  anything that is quite exactly fitting for the setting and story we're currently telling. I know that is frequently a bigger problem in PBTA systems than in ones where the mechanics are less dependent on the fiction, But the system that the players have been using is essentially a barebones PBTA system so I want to stick with that feel. 

The basic pitch and story so far is that they were all inhabitants of a remote mining village that happened to be Too Close to the Plot™️ 
Now they have been dragged into the resistance struggle of a planet currently besieged by two different galactic colonial factions after having just thrown off the yoke of a local tyrant that had been backed by one of those factions. Meanwhile the weapons of the oppressors (orbital ring, murderous AI(shackled space gods?)s, automated defense networks) are all going haywire as some Ancient Thing™️ is awakening in the planet's core.

I'm drawn to Impulse Drive and Uncharted Worlds, but there are definite obvious drawbacks to both of those given the need to translate existing characters and the setting and theme I currently have. 

I would love any input that anyone has, especially if you've played either of these systems and/or played a similar setting in a different system that you loved.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28001e5d0>,rpg,1742232148.0

people who are familiar with the game don't need my explanation as to why it felt like a great idea severely undercooked but the general gist for the rest is, imagine the game with unique selling point of it being diceless and your players being literal gods who can do anything. doesn't it sound like something to try? 

unfortunately, it turns out actual gods have nothing to do and have to rely on their mortal avatars to perform miracles so you're stuck with two character sheets one of which is redundant. for a while I nurtured the idea of hacking the game to make it more akin to what I envisioned but what with the state of indie sphere I'm sure I don't need to. someone somewhere has probably done all the hard work and made the god game but enjoyable

1jdcxh7,I am planning a two-three session adventure for a weekend. Horror 1890s,"Intro:  
  
*""Ain’t no frontier left no more. Used to be, a man could ride west and carve out somethin’ for himself, somethin real. But now? The law’s everywhere, railroads cuttin’ through the land like a knife, telegraphs carryin’ words faster than a horse ever could. Even the outlaws got nowhere left to run... Pinkertons will find you fore you can even spit.*

*Dogtown? Hell, that place’s been dead longer than most men been alive. Aint a soul left but the ones too stubborn or too crazy to leave. The wild’s takin’ it back, stone by stone. And whatever’s left out there… well, it ain’t meant to be found.*

*But see, folks ain’t satisfied with just the here and now. Ever since them damn Fox sisters started knockin on tables, folks been whisperin to ghosts, scribblin symbols in the dirt, thinkin they can talk to whatevers on the other side. Ain’t just fortune-tellers and city folk no more... out in places like Dogtown, the ones left behind get to thinkin’ maybe they can call somethin’ back, somethin’ older than dust, older than God.*

*They say the last folk livin out there were talkin’ to spirits carvin  strange words into rock, beggin’ for answers. But you ask me? Some questions don’t need answerin. Some doors, once opened, don’t close easy. And if you listen close at night, past the wind and the trees, you might just hear what came through.*

*I heard the last people that went there didn’t return … at least they didnt come back the same… ""*

This intro is kinda detached from adventure and just an intro to get them in the mood.  
  
The idea is that they will awaken and don't really know who they are around a table in a city left behind. Its gonna be based on the real town of [Dogtown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogtown,_Massachusetts), Massachusetts and Ill even include some real people from there.  
They will be five people who were out of luck and made a deal with something darker. They made to be sent into the future to a time when Dogtown was doing better. Little did they know it would only go south. There is basicly no longer anyone that lives in Dogtown. Just outside lives Thomasine “Tammy” Younger, Queen of the Witches. She was the one who helped them with the ritual. How she is still alive is one mystery.

My idea is that they will be trapped in Cape Ann. (I have a lot of history and lore about this kinda stuff that I can share if anyone cares to know) and the point of the  adventure is for them to discover the story of Dogtown both as players and characters and be scared. Witches, wild dogs and this old being(I think I will call it The Quiet Harvest) will all have affected the land. 

My Problem: How will I end this? Do I just put a timer on them, if they dont find a way out or manage to redo the ritual they die? Or how would I end this?  
What is their goal? Do they just have to survive 24 hours because the being they made the deal with only awakens that day(Blood Moon? Planets aligned? Midsummer? that kinda thing?) and if they survive they can leave Dogtown?

1jdcd4e,11 GM Tips To Make Games Awesome!,"I compiled the following tips as an attempt to create a universal set of tenets for myself to follow while GMing, ones that can be applied to most game systems and foster the kind of gameplay I have come to recognise as fun and frictionless, and to avoid the things that almost always end up leading to unfulfilling gameplay. These notes are written from the perspective of being a GM that wants great gaming experiences to happen for the widest variety of players. These ideas are not my own, but a compilation of helpful, and what I assume are widely applicable tips that I have learned over the years, but put into my own words, and that became proverbial to me during my journey to become a better GM.  
And so without further delay I present 11 GM tips to make games awesome!

1. **Make the players’ choices matter**
2. **Set clear expectations**
3. **Don’t plan, just prep**
4. **Use the rules as tools for fun**
5. **Consume media** 
6. **Use your own words**
7. **Show, don’t tell**
8. **Allow the players to succeed**
9. **Fail forward**
10. **Leave your ego at the door**
11. **Prioritize fun**

These tenets can be taken at face value, and can have multiple interpretations. I explain them in further detail ahead, as I understand them, and how I would hope to implement them in the games that I run. These notes make the assumption that the reader has some experience as a GM, but could still be helpful for new GMs. The approaches discussed here promote flexible thinking, strengthening your improvisational skills, and nurturing your imagination, as well as cutting back on time-wasting practices and identifying and strengthening the vital aspects of your game.

**‘1. Make the players’ choices matter’**  
First and foremost, player agency is everything. If you give the players the freedom they desire, they will be more likely to engage with the elements of the adventure you have provided. If the players feel like their choices matter, they will respect your adventure and want to invest in it. The story emerges from the conversations between the GM and players, don’t fight it! The players are part of the world and in control of their destiny. Never tell the players how their characters feel or how they act. It's okay to point the players in a particular direction or even be explicit about what the players should be trying to accomplish, just don’t have precise expectations about *how* the players should approach accomplishing those goals. Requiring the players’ to take specific actions to succeed is called ‘railroading,’ and it should be strictly avoided.  
To do this effectively, you should be trying to create problems, not solutions, and let the players handle those problems however they want. Do not force the game through a pinhole where there is only one way to ‘win’ the adventure or ‘beat’ an encounter; how things resolve should remain flexible or better yet, open ended. Not expecting what the players are going to do is part of the fun. Whether the players succeed or fail at their goals, they’ll prefer to have done it their way.  
You want to incentivise players to engage with the fiction by using rewards like information and treasure, but most of all, agency in the story’s outcomes. Always ask the players questions-- what are you doing? what do you hope will happen? As much as the structure of your adventure will allow, let the players wander, and decide for themselves what to interact with, and what is meaningful to pursue as they stumble across your adventure hooks.  
During play, let players explore their character’s uniqueness and be good at the things they chose during character creation. One easy way to demonstrate that you care about the players’ choices is to always refer to the players by their characters’ names, not the players’ actual names, during play, while building or adpating your adventure hooks to better fit, or to include aspects of a PC's backstory, will really go far in telling your players that you are invested in their participation. But mostly, you should just be interested in hearing the things the players want to tell you or ask you about their characters.  
Respect the players’ character creation autonomy within reason and be upfront about any restrictions you might have on players’ options beforehand.

**‘2. Set clear expectations’**  
Often done during a ‘zero session,’ where the GM and players meet up before the official start of the adventure and discuss the upcoming game. It's important that players know things about the game they will be playing, such as the system, genre, setting, etc... as well as working out a schedule together and communicating how long you anticipate the game will take.  
Let the players know how much prep they will need to do, and what your vision for the adventure is, as well as what playstyles are suitable for the game you plan to run. At this point it is important to establish safety tools and be clear about any controversial themes you might be planning to include. Every table is different, which stresses the importance of having these discussions beforehand.  
One way to approach this during the zero session is to decide on ‘lines and veils.’ A topic that is a ‘line’ means it absolutely never comes up during the game, meanwhile a topic that is a ‘veil’ is only vaguely hinted at during the game, remains undescribed, or is avoided by doing a ‘fade to black’ scene cut. Also make it clear to the players that if something happens during the game that bothers them, they should feel comfortable bringing it up, either during or after the game, and that they can either do this with the GM privately, or discuss it openly at the table.  
Be open minded about what your players require to feel comfortable.  
It helps for everyone to know each other too, so if you’re playing with new people, this adds to the importance of meeting up beforehand.  
Zero sessions have become commonplace and it's reasonable for players to expect to begin this way. It pays to prepare a list of talking points heading into your group's zero session, and be ready to take notes. Some campaigns aim to be so robust that multiple zero sessions may be necessary, while other games may only require an email or short conversation beforehand. In any case it never helps to skip out on, or rush through this very important step.

**‘3. Don’t plan, just prep’**  
GMing can be hard work, but we often make it much harder than it needs to be. Over-preparing can be exhausting and harm your game. Always closely study the adventure materials when preparing for a game, but then just create simple notes for reference during the game, and try to rely on your memory and imagination as best you can. You want to be able to react to the players with little hesitation, and having to constantly reference your notes can lose your players attention.  
Favor spontaneity. You want to be prepared for what might happen, not plan what will happen. Don’t log every detail of a map or scene, leave some things blank so that there can be room for improvisation or changes during gameplay. Being able to move pieces around behind the scene during play is a powerful tool. You should set things up in a way that allows you to be flexible about where the players can obtain important information. Where paths lead and what NPCs know only becomes established in the fiction once it is learned by the players during play; you’re allowed to change anything you want right up until you reveal it. Being flexible will pay off because you will be able to allow the narrative to develop naturally, based around the actions the players have taken, and that will become super food for player engagement. Also, roll tables are your friend, embracing that kind of randomness can breathe life into your routine.  
Colorful, elaborate maps and detailed miniatures(or tokens if using a VTT) work great to get players instantly immersed, and it's rewarding to see the players eyes light up upon seeing a marvelous set piece for the first time. But high-level presentation is not necessary for a lot of games, or even recommended. Becoming skilled at using a 'theater of the mind' approach(no maps or minis) is great for narrative freedom and fast gameplay. Using a mixture of theater of the mind and visual tools will give you the flexibility to connect your important encounters together with improvised scenes. Being able to abstract characters, monsters, and objects using plain tokens, and simple maps drawn on the fly using dry erase battle mats, will give you the freedom to be spontaneous and makes for easier prep too. There is no one way to prepare for a game that is better than another, but no matter what approach you take, it shouldn't harm your health or your budget, and should help you maintain the best possible game/life balance

**‘4. Use the rules as tools for fun’**  
Rules should be a conduit for the game to happen smoothly, and not get in the way of the fun. Some games have complex rules while others do not, but no matter which, if a rule feels illogical in the way it inhibits a player’s ability to interact with the fiction, bend that rule to make it work if it would result in smoother gameplay. And if there doesn’t seem to be a rule about a certain action a player wants to make, that doesn’t necessarily mean they can’t do it, that just means it's up to the GM to decide if it makes sense that their character could do that, and if so, what happens as a result. That could mean inventing a whole new rule on the spot; though it's probably best to try and shoehorn the undefined action into an existing rule, or something that works similarly. If you make a new mechanic, model it after ones in the system you're playing as best you can.  
As the GM, it is important that you try to be as well versed in the rules of the game you are running as you can, but this responsibility extends to the players as well, who should care about knowing and respecting the rules. Nobody needs to be a rules-cyclopedia to have fun playing a game, if anything, being too consumed with the minutiae can lead to pedantic and boring gameplay. Try to strike a balance between being faithful to the game’s design and your own personal style.  
Some players enjoy using rules to optimize their character’s abilities; this is okay but it should never be done to overshadow the other players or to ‘hack’ the game. In the worst case scenario of a character feature that is breaking the game, and you have to make an adjustment to balance things, be honest with the players about why you think this is needed, and understanding about why it may interfere with a player’s vision for their character. Tread lightly when changing rules to curb power levels, and maintain precedent as best you can when you have to make a ruling on something that isn’t clear per the game's instructions.  
If a disagreement about a rule or ruling comes up at the table, hear the players out and be fair, but remember that GMs should have the final say on how the rules work- this is often called ‘rule zero.’  
And try your best to choose a game system that best supports the kind of play experience you’re after. Don’t be afraid to leave the D&D sphere, it is a great game, but isn’t the best game for every play style or genre.

**‘5. Consume media’**  
Take inspiration from all your favorite things and don’t be afraid to steal ideas. Read books, watch television and movies, etc… Mix and match elements from all those things. Even if the players notice you’ve taken something from somewhere, they should still enjoy it. Some themes just remain timeless, so the more you know about fantasy and adjacent genres the better. If you aren’t planning to publish your adventure, then there isn’t any need to worry about plagiarism, unless your ideas are so derivative that it interferes with your game's ability to become immersive.  
Be tuned in to the world around you, invest in publications that enhance the games you love, and be on top of trends in gaming culture. Find the influencers in the RPG space that you like and watch their videos online, listen to their podcasts, follow them on social media, but try to diversify your consumption of media.  
Creating your own setting is fun, and for some, the most attractive part of GMing. The media you consume will inform your worldbuilding, so having varied sources to draw from will enrich your homebrew settings. Worldbuilding is a big part of TTRPGs, but it will take more time to immerse your players in a world that's unique to your own mind, while using a known setting, like one associated with a specific piece of media, can quickly put the players and GM on the same page. Another approach is to keep the setting ambiguous. This way, the larger world remains undefined, but based around our assumptions of what is found in a setting of that type, where small deviations from those big tropes will stand out more. Don’t log every detail, filling the blanks with improvisation when needed.  
It can even be fun to hand some of the world building duty over to the players too; for example, when a fictional location is introduced into the game, ask one or more of them why they have been to this place before and one fact they know about it. Or ask the players to describe an odd feature they notice about a creature they encounter or a secret they know about a person important to the adventure.  
Encourage the players to take inspiration from the media they enjoy too, as long as it contributes to the theme of the game. Some gaming groups do not mind a ‘gonzo’ element, where styles clash and things don’t have to make much sense, where others prefer a more realistic or immersive game; these are things that should be discussed while setting expectations during the zero session.

**‘6. Use your own words’**  
Don’t worry about having an expansive and impressive vocabulary, it's more important to express the details in clear and precise language. A good GM doesn’t need to be a scholar, they just need to be engaging; and it's more engaging when your words come naturally and the presentation is authentic. With that being said, if eloquent prose is your forte, by all means utilize those gifts, but do be careful to not lose your players’ attention, misdirect them, or confuse them with archaic verbiage. Try to speak off the cuff as often as possible; if you need prompts, keep your notes simple and easily read. Favor brevity.

**'7. Show, don’t tell’**  
This means keeping GM info hidden from players. Lean towards only telling the players what is observable or known by their characters. Players shouldn’t know or be told a monster’s stats or abilities, and should be discouraged from using out-of-game knowledge-- this is called ‘meta-gaming.’ A great way to discourage meta-gaming is to never speak the monsters names or mechanics. A good example would be to describe a squad of hulking, warty giants instead of simply stating ""there are ten ogres.""  
If a character might look to possess knowledge about a specific creature or object in the game, that's okay, but that info should be delivered with language that feels like what that player’s character would understand; for instance, don’t discuss a monster’s hit points, just describe its fortitude or its apparent injuries. Some players may have read the materials you are using, simply because they might be a GM at times too, or are just a fan of the material. This is great! They just have to honor the notion that they know things that their character doesn’t, and vice versa; they shouldn’t spoil any secrets inherent to the game’s enjoyment.  
Be forthcoming about important information but skip lengthy lore dumps, providing relevant details while implying deeper mysteries, while avoiding unimportant things that might cause pointless sidetracking. And try to resist any urge to reveal things the players missed after the fact, or what was improvised by you during the game either, always preserving an air of mystery around the GM’s knowledge. Keep your secrets secret, a magician never reveals how they did their tricks…

**‘8. Allow the players to succeed’**  
We are always looking for ways to challenge the players but we want to avoid bottlenecks or stoppages where the players squander too much of their time or that create unnecessary friction. The best way to avoid these scenarios is to provide the players with an infinite number of tools to succeed. This specifically means allowing for the creation of new pieces of fiction on the fly; examples might include introducing a faction the players can ally with, or an unexpected occurrence like a locked door being left ajar, a significant weather event, or dropping an obvious clue. Stir things up, provide a living world that always changes and presents new pieces of fiction the players can exploit; but do so while ratcheting up the pressure all the while. Every success or failure should raise the stakes, and alter the environment, even if just subtly. The important thing is to keep things moving and to keep the scene changing.  
Don’t worry if your game ends up seeming easy, it can be a lot of fun to win easily; this outcome is often way too underrated! Feeling powerful is as much of a part of the fun as feeling challenged. As the GM, you are the keeper of information and you should distribute that information freely, too often we can feel like we are giving away too much, when in fact we are not giving out enough. And sometimes the hammer just falls; if the characters fail, that's okay! From my experience, it is more fun to fail than to flounder, as the failure feels finite and temporary, while floundering feels like a loop or a trap.  
Some games are deadlier than others, and players cherish their characters differently, which are things you should consider when applying pressure. The likelihood of character death(or failure) is another good thing to discuss during your zero session or while planning the game. Character death can be upsetting, while remaining fair and impartial, also be kind about how this might affect a player, and take a break if needed.  
Be a fan of the players’ characters. You should be rooting for them to succeed, and even in those moments where you’re all facing the impartiality of the dice, the GM should be invested in the players’ goals, and express solidarity with the players when a twist of fate sends things off course.

**‘9. Fail forward’**  
Bad rolls happen, and should be part of the fun of the game, but the GM should never let the results of a bad roll prevent something important to the continuation of the adventure from happening. Instead, use the bad roll to let the players advance in a less than optimal way, like losing an advantage, or introducing some new danger or bad omen. Another way to look at this is to let a good roll be a ‘door’ and a bad roll be a ‘window.’ This means the good roll allows the player to ‘pass,’ while the bad roll prevents them from ‘passing,’ but perhaps provides the player with useful information, or suggests a different approach. While forging outcomes for a roll, using this method fosters the ‘fail forward’ notion by letting pivotal rolls, whether they're good or bad, always be a form of advancement.  
And sometimes bad rolls are just bad rolls, so when you need to let a terrible outcome come to pass, just provide a new circumstance to deal with as a result. Even during a “TPK”(total party kill), the next round of characters should see the effects of what the previous party had done, and build on that to approach the game in a different way. Depending on the intended lethality of your game, you could use character death as an opportunity to raise the stakes, increase drama, and introduce new information.  
You shouldn’t ask the players to roll for every action they take, sometimes it makes sense that they would just automatically succeed(or fail) if their idea was good, or their character is competent at such a task, or their chosen action is of little to no consequence. Sometimes the story just really needs to move forward without a roll getting involved and potentially mucking things up. A type of roll we should be looking to avoid is one we would keep asking the players to continually make until one of them hopefully succeeds. Avoiding rolls that could inhibit the game is a good practice, and by not having the players make lots of meaningless dice rolls, you can signal to them where they should be looking.

**‘10. Prioritize fun!’**  
You are the facilitator of fun, it is your most important job. Every group is different, so focus on the things your players like and handwave the things they don’t like. If a certain mechanic is dragging the game down, ditch it or modify it. Learn the system you are using but don’t feel beholden to it, this is *your* game.  
Keep an eye on the mood of the table, making sure players are being respectful towards each other. It’ll be everyone’s job to balance the feelings at the table, but as the GM you’ll have the best chance to curb bad behavior, which hopefully won’t happen if we set expectations properly. Calling out bad or irritating behavior at the table, or even creepy vibes, is sometimes necessary, but if it can wait until you can speak with the offending player privately, that's often the best way. If something gets out of hand to the point where it needs to be dealt with immediately, address it politely, and if needed, look to the other players for support when confronting the offending player or players, but do so while not seeming like you are ganging up on anyone. Calmly explain why what they’re doing isn't appropriate and then help them get involved in a more constructive way.  
Be patient with inexperienced players or anyone who is confused about something in the game and always respond kindly to even the most basic questions, so long that they’re relevant to the game.  
If you notice things are lagging, or the players are tired, disinterested, or even offended by something, perhaps call that session early, or expedite the current scene and move on. And always remember that the GM is a player too, and that you should be enjoying the game too. GM burnout is a very real thing; if needed, end a session early or skip a scheduled game to rejuvenate. As the saying goes “No gaming is better than bad gaming”

**‘11. Leave your ego at the door’**  
A great adventure is not hinged on the GMs amazing intellect or writing talents. Avoid overengineering adventures so much that the players feel like rats forced to hunt cheese in your maze or actors in your movie. The adventure should feel like a shared creative endeavor where everyone gets to influence the story’s trajectory and outcome, not the GMs personal project. Even during a simple dungeon crawl, the players can end up doing unexpected things that should leave you scratching your head. Instead of feeling frustrated that the players aren’t engaging with the story in the way you had hoped, simply embrace the chaos, and leave behind the expectations you had for how things would play out. This goes back to the ‘don’t railroad’ sentiment. but goes a bit further in that you should remember the players didn’t come to hear you spin a tale, they came to play characters in a game.  
Conversely, players should have no expectations that you are their entertainer. It's everyone at the table's responsibility to contribute to the fun. The players should respect that you put in the effort to make the game happen, and make a cooperative effort to explore what you have put before them. And if a player is having a bad time, don’t take it to heart, sometimes players need to figure out if they can enjoy something or not themselves. Just be there to help if you can.  
It's also okay to pause the game because you’re feeling overwhelmed, or because the players wandered too far away from the things you had prepared for that session, and you need more time to do additional preparation for the next part of the game; just don’t outwardly express exasperation about it, try to be excited to explore that new angle when you reconvene.  
You should be open to learning new ideas and methods, and always look for ways to improve. Confidence is an important trait for GMs to have but you should also look for chances to be humble. If you are called out by a player for any mistakes you may have made, be honest but don’t dwell on it, you can fix the mistake and quickly move on. As the GM you are not the ‘leader,’ though your presence is vital.  
You must be thoughtful about the way you wield the power that comes with GMing. Never feel vengeful towards or overly protective of any specific players, you will need to embrace impartiality and treat the players as equals. And always be kind to yourself and remember that perfection is not your goal.

I hope these notes are helpful to others. For me, it was a productive exercise to write it all down and join some disconnected philosophical threads together into a cohesive method. It certainly isn't the only way to run awesome games, but these ideas have helped me get the kind of gaming experience I was after. My time spent pursuing this hobby has brought me joyful memories and lasting friendships with people I have met along the way, as well as its share of awkward or uncomfortable moments, and thankfully, just a few regrettable incidents. All in all, these experiences didn’t just inform my opinions on gaming, but have helped me be better at connecting with my peers. Being a GM has been a rewarding way to have a creative outlet with very little pressure attached. And it has been thrilling to regularly create with others for no other reason than to pass the time while indulging in each others’ limitless imaginations. Let's hope for us all to find many more years of enjoyment doing the things we love. Happy gaming!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x280152390>,rpg,1742217336.0

1jd9mw7,System suggestion for a grand conspiracy filled adventure,"Hi there I would I have an idea for a long campaign to run, but I think I would need a different system to play in.

# TLDR:

I have an idea for a game, set in present-ish times, where the players get toghether for a simple adventure (A heist, an archeological dig, find a McGuffin etc) where they find out that the world they knew was a lie, and the Conspiracy people were onto something. They uncover the mysteries of the world, travel far and wide beyond the ice wall so that they can do the thing and save the world.

But Im not sure on what system I would like to use for this, see my ideas below in the SYSTEM part of the post. Thanks

# LONGER GAME SETTING

So I got the idea while watching Milo Rossi´s conspiracy debunking videos, where some guy was showing this big map of the Flat earth and all its Beyond the Ice Wall DLC-s and my thought was...THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT GAME TO RUN. So I want to run it.

The setting would be Real world, with elements of Low Fantasy based on Cryptids, conspiracies and other fun stuff. Meaning there are lizard people, magic users, dragons and magic artefacts, but these are rare and not many exist (at least not in the base world) These would be dangerous and powerful, or whimsical and weird.

Ex. There woudl be dragons, rare with just a few living. They are Old and Powerful and ELDRICH Creatures, so if you try and fight it, you will need to roll another character becasue you aint beating a grant magical creature with sticks and guns.

I dont have the full story yet, but it would be somethign on the lines of:

\- The players get hired for a job for some archeological/corporate job where they need to reclaim the THING (tm). This will be a map, or part of a puzzle, or idk some grand magic artefact. But along the adventure they get betrayed (by the company or a rival company), and this sets off events where they venture on an adventure to get revenge or to see what is beyond.

# SYSTEM HELP.

So Ive played a few trpg games in the past, and have a general knowledge for 5E but none of the systems I know would fit snuggly for the game. It would be good ifg it was a symple system, with room to improvise.

It would be equal parts **EXPLORATION/TRAVEL  - SOCIAL STUFF/INFORMATION GATHERING - FIGHTING/COSMIC HORROR (ish)**

**DnD:** I Like DnD 5E as much as the next person, but I think its too complicated for newer players, and while the setting is fine, I just feel off to use that

**Powered by the Apocalypse:** I like the offshoots of this game system, but we played this and I just dont Vibe with this. ( I really want to use this, becasue its great, but not sure if it would work)

**Moster of The Week:** I have ample experience in this one, and would love to use it for this game, since it checks most boxes, but I dont think it would be the best fit, due to the nature of the game itself with the Doomsday clock and such.

Other systems I saw, and could work but who knows.

**Into the Odd, Liminal Horror, Cult, Roadside Picnic**

Sooo thats All I Have, If you could reccomend a systhem that is simple and would fit this setting please do tell. Thanks, gave a great day!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2801bb260>,rpg,1742208035.0
1jd8x1w,"Felt unsatisfied with the tools the Avatar system gave me, but a small change made things more interesting.","For the bulk of running the game as a GM, I  found the main... actions and abilities given to be rather lackluster. There were many different speech based checks, but every physical act fell under ""training"" or ""luck."""" Even recollection of knowledge. I stopped asking for rolls at point because of how lackluster much of it felt, which may have been a feature, not a bug, but it didn't feel all that engaging even then.

Well, the final in-game day rolled around, and the party found themselves racing against the clock playing catchup on the machinations of 4 conflicting factions. To make the pressure tangible and evoke a greater sense of climactic build-up, I decided to throw out the main gameplay system and told them ""every dice roll you make going forward will have you step towards an ideal and use it to make the roll. Use fatigue to negate it."" At that point, the character's relationship with the balance system became front and center and despite their only being two balance stats period—which are mutually exclusive—their nebulous nature and potential for disaster if the players are not careful suddenly heightened the pressure. One player told me, ""I don't know how my character is going to fair in combat."" To which I expressed sympathy, but also told them to figure it out—because in a sense that is the pressure their characters are feeling as well and if they want to succeed they need to start finding balance. The whole point of the mechanic.

Looking back on the game, I've found that... while there are uses for ideals in the system, they're rather easy to ignore. My players never spent fatigue to use them. In a sense, I think the core of the game should be further integrated into the balance system, over standard stats, and actions that the loop was written to be now. By having balance be the default, not only do they need to interpret their every action between two conflicting worldviews but devote enough of themselves to them to get stuff done but not so much they ruin themselves and I think if the system really leaned into that as it's foundation it could be much more engaging. Instead, it feels like a facsimile of a ""normal"" rpg stats + skills base with its hook incidentally tacked on. 

This is my first PbtA system so I won't comment on that as a whole and I'm well aware of the prospect I'm running it wrong, but these were my two cents on running a short campaign since last June.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2801c8c50>,rpg,1742205065.0

1jd7i5l,"REVERSE D&D - One Player, Several GMs","This (fun/idiotic) idea just came to me, so this is untested. Thought I'd share here. If people want to try it, let me know how it turns out! If this doesn't gain any traction, it should be deleted to keep this subreddit neat.

Reverse D&D has one player and X GMs, where X is the number of people playing minus the one self-appointed/designated as player. It can be dressed up in several ways based on a chosen setting. 

**Here's an example setting:**

A devout prince (say, knight, or cleric) must save a princess from the clutches of a terrible, avaricious, and malevolent Black Dragon. However, the captive princess is, in truth, a primordial being of magic, who only let herself be captured in order to see who will rise to the challenge and save her, in the process finding her perfect soulmate. The princess has little animal familiars across the continent, and when a potential rescuer decides to try and save her, the familiars inform the princess. 

The princess wants to vet these rescuers - after all, she doesn't want just anyone to come and save her, lest she end up with some brute or, worse, someone whose political views on peasant taxation don't match her own. So when the devout prince makes his grand claim and sets off to save the princess, the game begins.

In this setting, the player is the white knight. The captured princess is the GMs. Because the captured princess is a being of untold magical prowess, she can split up into several copies of herself (that is, into as many copies as there are GMs) which waft, unseen and unnoticed, out of the dragon's lair as mist rises in the morning. The simulacra - themselves beings of old magic by sake of their replicate nature - can in turn transform into anyone and anything (from small objects to whole cities). 

It is these simulacra the player will encounter over and over again in his journey towards the princess. All for one! All for love!

**Gameplay**:

\[I'm imagining each session equalling one level's worth of experience. This can of course be modified. Level 1 is the exception, and will be described later\].

If the session is meant to last two hours, and there are 4 GMs, then each GM should prep for about half an hour of GMing. 

The session begins with each GM (simulacra) rolling initiative. Then each GM reveals their choice for the session, and they proceed in order of their rolls. 

The choices to be revealed are chosen from the following list: ""Combat"", ""Roleplay"", ""Challenge"" and ""Location"". These choices would have been chosen, and prepped for, before the session. 

The player makes it through the session and gains a level at the end.

**Gameplay in action:**

Let us say there are 6 players. In this setting, one is the designated white knight. Five are the designated GMs. The player is at Level 2.

The five GMs roll initiative, then all of them reveal their choice. The order comes out as: ""Roleplay"", ""Combat"", ""Location"", ""Challenge"", ""Combat"". Each GM will have to provide a plausible narrative for their choice and each GM will have to continue the narrative created by the one preceding them.

\*

The first GM (""Roleplay"") has it easy, as they have no one to follow. For instance, an old friend of the devout knight tries to dissuade him from embarking on such a perilous adventure.

***Roleplay****:*  Roleplay allows the player to develop their character (flaws and all) and, as always, can involve all sorts of rolls and antics. Roleplay is always an opportunity for character development.

\*

The second GM (""Combat"") has to build on the previous. Let's say the second GM had prepared 2 standard goblins as an encounter. Following the first GM, this second GM can choose to have the goblins sneak in, kill the old friend, and then attempt to kill the devout knight. OR they can choose to have the goblins be hirelings of the old friend who *really* wants to convince the devout knight of the dangers ahead. OR the old friend leaves the player in a huff and finds themselves in trouble, so the player has to save their friend from the goblins.

***Combat****:* In short, just like any other kind of choice, ""Combat"" will be prepped before the session, but how it fits into the story is decided impromptu based on the previous GMs narrative and the player's actions. Combat is always an opportunity for character growth and story development. 

\*

The third GM (""Location"") will then lead the player into where they are subsequent to the goblin encounter. ""Location"" choices move the story forward, geographically-speaking, towards the princess, and offer what locations usually offer: shops, equipment, dungeons, etc. If the second GM decided the goblins sneak into the castle, but the third GM had prepped a little hamlet on the castle's rural outskirts, the player and the third GM figure out how he gets there. Or one of the goblins, close to dying, escapes in the direction of the hamlet. Or the knight's old friend has been killed by said goblins, and the knight must inform his friend's mother of her son's death. His mother lives in the little hamlet.

***Location****:* As usual, ""Location"" and travel is the usual balance between the player's free choices and the GM's overall plan for the campaign.  

\*

The fourth GM (""Challenge"") has prepped a puzzle with levers and traps, with the prize for solving it being a mystical clue to the location of the captive princess. (Remember, the GM is a simulacrum of the princess, so they *want* to lead the knight to the princess - how else will they test if he's worthy?). 

So, if the player is now at his dead friend's mother's house, maybe the player hears strange noises in the basement, and finds an alchemical lab with the puzzle to be solved there. (Is the friend's mother an alchemist? Sure!). Or, if the player's friend is still alive and in the third GM's hamlet, maybe the friend has heard rumour of a wizard tower in the forest surrounding the hamlet it - finding it and solving the puzzle would be the challenge. 

***Challenge:*** This can incorporate all sorts of puzzles, skill checks, and non-combat difficulties that allow space for challenging the player (rather than the player's character) as well as letting the dice do their portion of story telling.

\*

The fifth GM has also chosen ""Combat"". Let's say this GM, given the player's current level of 2, has prepared a Brown Bear. Depending on where they are - and you get the gist by now - the bear can either be in the forest surrounding the wizard's tower, or it can erupt from a strangely-coloured phial in the alchemy basement (""Didn't you notice it steadily grow a deeper shade of brown as the minutes ticked by? No? You must have been too focused on the puzzle...""), or it can burst out of a locked room, a lord's pet kept illegally in the castle (if the player is still there) 

\*

As you can see, what Reverse Dungeons and Dragons (R&D&D?) does best is: prevent railroading; have all players at the table take charge of the story; create wacky and unforeseen causes and effects though its full embrace of improv's ""yes and...""; really focus on character development; allow the usual strengths of D&D (dice, combat, roleplay, etc.) to shine.

***The Level 1 Exception***

Level 1 should be the exception in that it gets everyone used to things.

In this case only, the GMs do not roll for initiative. Instead, the order of choices is pre-set as ""Location"", ""Roleplay"", ""Challenge"", and ""Combat"", in that order, to ease everyone into the game style and provide a solid story foundation (character, setting, motivations, goals) atop of which to build future sessions.

***Identical Choices***

Let's say a session begins with the following choice order: ""Roleplay, Roleplay, Combat, Combat, Challenge"". 

In cases where two adjacent choices are identical (in this case, two adjacent Roleplay choices, and two adjacent Combat choices), then those choices should be merged.

If the GM for Roleplay 1 had prepped a friendly Green Hag, and the GM for Roleplay 2 had prepped a mysterious traveller, then both GMs play at the same time. The Green Hag and the Mysterious Traveller met on the road a few minutes before they encounter the player. Or the Mysterious Traveller guides the player to the Green Hag. Or they're lovers. Or enemies with a common goal. Or they're arguing about who has the better cloak. Either way, the player has to talk to two very real NPCs simultaneously, something that's not usually possible with one GM who has their NPCs - even when encountered in the plural - act in order.

If the GM for Combat 1 has chosen a rival knight, and the GM for Combat 2 has chosen a gargoyle, then perhaps the rival knight, as he attacks the player, gets interrupted by gargoyles who want to eat the both of them for breaking rules of chivalry. Or perhaps the knight enlisted the help of a local wizard to awaken the gargoyles and aid him in his attack on the player. Or the player made a mistake in the prior roleplay with the mysterious traveller, who, in retribution, animates a gargoyle to attack him and tips off a rival knight as to the whereabouts of the player.

For all these, I imagine a brief scuffle behind the GM screen, as GMs quickly decide on how things will happen. ""This, and then this? Or these together?"" ""No no, what do you think of *this* instead??"" ""Yeah!""

***The Simulacra's Boredom***

The simulacra don't just fulfil their role (as a Green Hag, as a hamlet, as an alchemy lab, as a bear, etc.) and then disappear. They may disappear from the player's view, but they're still around.

*And they're bored*. Just as the princess of whom they're a copy, they don't enjoy hanging about. They need to be active. Couple this with strong opinions, and they might very well interfere with what another simulacrum is doing with the purpose of testing the devout knight's fittingness for the princess. 

As such, inactive GMs have one GM Action to expend on each active GMs turn. This is a feature purely to make sure everyone at the table is involved at all times, with the added benefit of throwing further chaos in the midst. The following GM Actions can be modified and added to, but, as a starting point, GMs have the following actions to choose from:

\- Reroll (an inactive GM might try to make the active GM's gargoyles hit instead of miss, or might try to see what the Green Hag would have done if she rolled lower perception. The inactive GM does the rerolling and the narration stemming from the new canon result);

\- Rando (an inactive GM can introduce another NPC, whether it's a silly villager stumbling into the middle of a combat, or the Mysterious Traveller's brother wanting his 5 gold back, or a gargoyle who acts very much like a labrador puppy. Each instance allows the player an expanding field of choices - do they save the villager, or ignore her? Do they help the traveller's brother, or attack him? Do they adopt the gargoyle puppy, or use it as a barking shield for the next attack? Because different GMs are operating at the same time here, you can overload the playing field much more than with what a sole GM can do, as the active GM can continue focussing on the gargoyles while the inactive GM takes care of the villager's actions).

\- Natural Event (a table of different environmental events can be drafted - depending on the setting - and the inactive GM taking their GM Action would roll on that table. This could mean a meteor squashes the rival knight, or a roaming banshee kidnaps the green hag mid-revelation, or it's raining and the player is now miserable and wet).

**Nations Game Military System (Dice-Based)**

This system determines **battle outcomes, troop movements, and military effectiveness** using dice rolls while considering factors like terrain, unit composition, and morale.





Each type of unit has a Strength(dmg), Range(hit range and detection range), Movement(movement/turn), and Special(unique traits)



Each adv is a +1, each dis is a -1

Each unit has different die

Can assign a general to a army



All troops have morale that I decide based on factors like battle length, home battles, supply lines, battle actions, they have the possibility to defect, switch sides, etc. if they keep low.

  


Generals and Command Structure





Players can assign a General to an army, providing strategic bonuses and unique abilities. Generals influence:

Troop Morale: Affecting unit effectiveness and resilience.

Tactical Maneuvers: Granting special actions or rerolls.

Battle Modifiers: Improving attack, defense, or movement capabilities.

Choosing the right general for the right battle can be as crucial as having a well-trained army.

# Phase 1: Deployment and Travel

This phase is dedicated to positioning troops, setting up fortifications, and preparing for engagements. It includes:



Troop Movement: Maneuver armies across the battlefield, determining their locations and potential engagement areas.



Deployment: Assign troops to key locations, fortify positions, and prepare for battle.



Reconnaissance: Scout enemy positions to gain intelligence on their numbers, location, and potential strategies.



This phase determines the initial conditions for battle and can set the stage for success or failure.



# Phase 2: Defense and Trapping

This phase allows armies to set up defensive measures before battle begins. It includes:



Constructing Fortifications: Build barricades, trenches, and other defenses.

Laying Traps: Set up ambushes, pitfalls, and other battlefield hazards.

Positioning Units: Strategically place troops to optimize defense.

Unit Camouflage and Concealment: Utilize terrain and special abilities to evade detection.

A well-prepared defense can turn the tide of battle, mitigating numerical disadvantages and disrupting enemy plans.



# Phase 3: Attack and Engagement

If forces have encountered each other, combat is resolved in this phase. Combat resolution follows these key mechanics:



1. Scale Ratio Multiplier (SRM) & Force Comparison

SRM has a dual meaning:

Combat Scaling:

Each unit type has a Strength (Damage), Range (Hit & Detection Range), Movement (Per Turn), and Special Traits.

Compare the size of each force.

The smaller force sets the baseline for the engagement scale.

For every full increment of the baseline above the opponent’s force, the larger force gains an additional damage die.

If the difference is minor (less than the baseline increment), the larger force only gains advantage (+1 modifier), while the smaller force has disadvantage (-1 modifier).

If the larger force vastly outnumbers the smaller force (e.g., 1,000 vs. 1,000,000), the smaller force is overwhelmed.



Unit Attributes (SRM):

Strength (S): Determines the unit's base damage die. (and amount of die will go here but thats based on troop amount)

Range (R): Determines both the effective attack range and detection capability.

Movement (M): Determines how far a unit can travel per turn.

Special Traits: Unique abilities or characteristics that provide tactical advantages.



2. Combat Resolution

Both sides roll damage dice based on troop types and numbers.

The higher roll determines the victor in that round of combat.

Modifiers such as terrain, traps, general abilities, and unit abilities can influence results.

After resolution, an estimate is made of how many troops remain on each side.

Each group of troops can act separately within this phase, allowing for multiple engagements if applicable.



# Phase 4: Supply and Recuperation

After battle, forces must manage logistics and recovery. This phase involves:



Supply Line Check: Determines whether the army has an intact and operational supply chain. If supply lines are cut, forces may suffer attrition and lack reinforcements.

Foraging and Resource Gathering: If no supply lines exist, troops must rely on local resources, which are often insufficient for sustained warfare.

Reinforcements and Recovery: If supply lines are intact, forces may receive troop reinforcements, ammunition, food, and medical aid, allowing them to recover before the next battle.

Once this phase is completed, the system loops back to Phase 1: Deployment and Travel, continuing the cycle of warfare.

1jczcma,I am making a VERY simple ttrpg and i wanted some advice!!,"My college has a ""D&D"" group. We just finished a campaign where the rules were very much on the style of Noah the Magic — simple and to the point, roll for everything with little to no modifiers, and was basically not too roleplay-friendly. I am gonna be the new DM, and I had a campaign idea, so I mashed a couple of rules from different games, and we are going to stress test the system on a session zero with some premade characthers where their backstory is prety short  . But I wanted some advice on what to add or change, or if I should just go ahead and put everything aside for now and use a pre-existing system if it fits the game idea, which is kind of like a Terror Infinity, where they have a space they can get powers, bloodline, magic, everything, and then they drop into various worlds where they can do missions for points to use in the space.  


RACE
Human(starting)
A boon from the entity allows the character to integrate certain bloodlines, granting traits. When too many are mixed, they can cause disadvantages due to conflicting aspects or even advantages. There will be opportunities to remove some or alleviate conflicts, or players can choose to integrate only one thing, such as vampires. In a side adventure, they can collect different vampire bites to fix disadvantages or gain advantages.
STATS and Resources
• Health: When higher, it provides bonuses to physical stats; when lower, it results in disadvantages. The higher your physical stats, the higher your health will be.
• Mana: Once depleted, you can use health to cast spells or sanity to activate special abilities.
• Sanity: When higher, it gives bonuses to mental stats; when lower, it causes disadvantages based on wisdom.
• Tokens: Boons granted to characters by the eldritch being allow the use of special abilities, such as common sense, or can be used to increase the number on a roll. For example, if you roll a d4 and get a 3, you can spend a token to get to 4 and roll again.
• Favor: Can be used after big stories in the space to get anything.
• Cash: Used in stories to get items or bribes.
The following stats are assigned to dice rolls such as d20 or d4. You can choose either to halve the roll for a stable result or roll freely to try for a higher number. You can also gain stable increases to each stat based on traits (unless specified, they affect the total, not the dice roll), such as a 

""Jock"" trait providing boosts to body and stamina.
• Body: Affects physical speed, strength, and similar rolls.
• Stamina: Determines health regeneration speed and how long you can run.
• Dexterity: Influences intricate movements or crafting abilities.
• Mind: Governs any logical rolls.
• Emotional: Impacts emotional rolls, mental strength, charm, etc.
• Perception: Affects both passive and active perception.

TRAITS
Traits are obtained through gameplay or backstory. They provide access to increased stats, new skills (both beneficial and detrimental), replace traditional classes, and can be leveled up.
Skills and Expertise
Special abilities or knowledge that a character might have or get based on traits might require resources to use or just time and a good roll, such as first aid vs. heal.
• Common sense: Costs a certain amount of tokens depending on difficulty and can be complemented with a high roll or sanity.
• Meta gaming: Allows for the transfer of knowledge or skills from players to characters, similar to common sense.
Gameplay Mechanics
• When rolling a stat and hitting the max number, you can roll again to get a higher roll, making it possible to get very high rolls even if you are focused on mental stats.
• When performing certain actions, you can get tokens (up to the DM's discretion). When failing, the enemy might get one, 

or you might; when succeeding, you can get one.
• When making certain choices that contribute to the narrative or successfully completing certain challenges or missions, you can get tokens or favors.
• Injuries: When taking a certain amount of damage to sanity or health, you get injuries, which would fall under a negative trait (temporary).
• After each encounter is solved, you get the opportunity to use favor with the being.
• Plot armor: Allows for a character to roll extra dice on every roll and/or gain advantage (roll two dice and use the higher of the two). It can be restored, and it gets chipped away.
• Disadvantage: Certain traits or choices might grant disadvantages (which mean you have to roll the lower of the two dice).
•	If you get both advantage and disadvantage at the same time, they cancel out unless the advantage or disadvantage is stacked more than 2 times (e.g., 3A vs. 1D). If it’s 4A vs. 1D or there’s a 3 or more stack difference, special things happen.
• If you succeed a roll or fail a roll by more than 5, it becomes a critical roll, and it improves by every 5 away.
• When players decide to tackle one of the big stories, they get teleported to the specific story.
•	Once completed, they gain access to that region and certain new side missions and discount on certain items . And an inheritance 
•	In between big stories, they can go on side adventures, fight some monsters, and do some relaxing, non-consequential grinding.
• When doing big stories, players might be granted certain 

restrictions, which the entity will compensate for with tokens.
Game Lore
An extremely powerful entity has made a space beetween where different stories interact and exist in the same place, yet they do not seem to fuse outside of some isolated cases. Thus, the entity has summoned you or awakened some of you to accomplish certain tasks to fuse the stories in exchange for certain desires of your characters.
• If you are good, then the entity is being opposed by an evil entity who wishes to make these single stories into a world of horror and pain.
• If you are bad, then you are trying to recruit evil beings  or serve the evil being by being the bad guys 
Or An extremely powerful entity has made a space beetween where stories,exist the entity has summoned you 
• Or it’s a VR game.

Environment plays a part on everything if it's dark that would affect Perception And force players to use light sources that could signal their location 
In certain location resources such as water and food would be consumed faster
Certain traits Might change based on player actions
Such and have opportunities for evolution

1jcug3u,Do you prefer Vancian or roll to cast?,"We'll consider modern DnD's pseudo-Vancian system to also be Vancian for the purposes of this conversation. I prefer roll to cast. It makes magic seem dangerous and uncontrollable. When magic is perfectly controllable by someone of sufficient skill, it's not really magic anymore. If you're studying techniques that create a perfectly replicable effect, then that's basically just science that operates under a different set of laws of physics than our own. Magic should always have a chance of going catastrophically wrong. When you're giving the middle finger to the fundamental rules of reality, sometimes it should give one back.

It also makes magic something to not be used frivolously. It can be easy for magical characters to overshadow mundane ones. ""Why have a Rogue when the Wizard can cast knock?"" is a question commonly asked in games like DnD to demonstrate the martial caster gap. In a roll to cast system however, the question inverts. Magic has a risk to it and it becomes a last resort. It ends up being used only when neccesary, which keeps it rare and more mysterious. This also fits with a lot of the more classic depictions of wizards. Gandalf is the archetypical wizard, and he doesn't exactly run around throwing fireballs left and right. He resorts to his sword more often than not and only uses magic when it's needed. I've always preferred this kind of wizard to the kind we have now in a lot of RPGs that seems to play more like mages in Skyrim (not a knock on Skyrim, I love the game I just want something different out of TTRPGs).

Roll to cast systems represent a danger to magic that also help solve a number of world building issues. Such as the age old ""Why don't mages just rule everything here?"" question. In a world where magic has inherent risk, long lived and powerful mages will have had to display an incredible amount of prudence (and possibly even a little luck )in their use of magic. This means that most mages who would be powerful enough to rule aren't likely to be of the disposition to want to. Most of the more ambitious mages are likely to have blown themselves up, or get sucked into a different dimesion before they become powerful enough to stake their claim. The few who don't however can become powerful, but rare, villains.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2803dd940>,rpg,1742155704.0

I’ve been playing ttrpgs for around 20 years now. Mostly around D&D and mostly as a DM. I absolutely love it. Over the years I’ve went from just complete theater of the mind to making art, crafting maps and trying to refine my game with better and better detail as well as hone my skills. I’ve often run into walls with creativity, made 100 npcs, got 100 maps to use, thought of every scenario possible, etc. But I’ve never ran more than 1 game at a time besides maybe a one shot that I extensively prepared or ran Apocalypse World (a super easy to run ttrpg with no DM prep) on the side. 

I went ahead and convinced myself recently that I can handle a second D&D game so one is about to start. We have session 0 in a few days. But I’ve just been itching to play more games. So I start up another game, however this game isn’t d&d and requires little prep. But I’m also wanting to start a game of Apocalypse World. 

A huge part of me says going from 1 to 4 games is crazy obviously. But I dream of just being a full time DM. 

I also have ADHD so I tend to hyperfixate on things which makes it both easy and hard for running games. When I do, I can end up prepping like 5+ sessions worth of content in a single sitting. But during my lulls I tend to just avoid the game altogether until it’s time to play often wanting a different style game. All until I fixate on the game again and the cycle continues.

1jcrcbu,Looking for resources to make a campaign based around Russian mythology in the 1980s in the U.S.S.R.,"Like the title says I'm looking for resources to create a campaign that takes place in the 1980s in the U.S.S.R that is based around Russian myths and folklore. I would love any RPG that either shows that this is in the 80s U.S.S.R or the Russian monsters, objects, magic, or anything like that. I can mix multiple RPGs because I doubt there is just one that would have the magic and folklore of Russian mythology and feeling and vibe of the totalitarian U.S.S.R.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2804378c0>,rpg,1742147789.0
1jcqgv5,"Quick military campaign, what system?","My party of 4 has managed to convince the leader of a small army to invade an enemy territory and help them depose the current ""ruler"". I would like to run one or two sessions in ""tactician mode"", on a hex map that I already have, where my players (and/or their characters) would be able to observe the battlefield and influence it.

I could go the easy way and just assign a few minis on a hex map, but I'd like a bit more complexity, and for each PC to have their own benefits according to their character choices. I will probably end up doing my own mini-system for this (unless something fits perfectly) but I'm looking for inspiration since I only have 2 weeks to prep this.

So, here are my questions: 

1. Is there an already-made D&D 5e system I could use for this?
2. If not, what system could work to run this, parallelly to the D&D 5e system we use?
3. If you have ran any similar thing for your games, how did you do it and how did it go? Anything I should be mindful of?

Thanks in advance!

PS: I will probably post this in D&D specific communities as well, but I don't want to limit myself to strictly D&D5 materials",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2804356d0>,rpg,1742145520.0

1jcpam7,Campaigns - 1 Big Book or 4 Zines?,"In 2023 I released a zine sized hard sci-fi TTRPG called The Nullam Project, which takes inspiration from Star Trek: DS9. I have been working on a short campaign, which I will be publishing in print and PDF, but I keep coming back to the topic of format.

*Before I get into it, yes I know about the* r/RPGdesign *subreddit, but I feel that this is more of a player/customer facing question, so this is the better place for it.*  
*I will also mention that I am in Canada, so my prices are in Canadian dollars.*

I have 2 options for release. I can do one big book or because the campaign is made up of 4 adventures, I can spread it out over 4 zines in a series.

Personally, I really like the formatting of Paizo's Adventure Paths, where you get 5 modules that can be run individually or be combined into a campaign, but there is a hidden cost to this. 4 small books actually cost twice as much to manufacture as 1 big book, which means some of that cost gets passed on to the customer.

As a business, the idea of 4 individual books has some pros and cons. On the one hand I can offer a bundle deal and sell more product, which also makes my back catalog look larger, but on the other hand, what if someone doesn't buy the whole set and it screws up my stock numbers or they get angry because they didn't realize that the single book they got was part of a set?

The big book would come at a lower price, but it also has it's downsides. My core book is a saddle stitch zine, but if I go with a big book the page count will get too high and I would have to switch to perfect bound, which doesn't lay flat and takes away from the formatting consistency.

For reference The Nullam Project core book has an MSRP of $15 and if I went the 4 zines approach, they would also use that price *($60 total)*, though I would likely offer a bundle deal for $50 if you got all 4.  
If I did the big book, I would likely have to set the MSRP between $30 and $40, depending on how things lined up with the printer.

As a consumer, it's an easy choice for me. I would pay the extra and get the 4 smaller books, but I am not the consumer, I am the developer, so I tend to nitpick about things that a normal person might not even care about.

Does formatting and consistency matter to you?, and are you willing to pay a little more to make sure that everything matches or is the cost reduction more appealing?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2804365d0>,rpg,1742142478.0
1jcoyuw,Which system has more juice or vibe—Star Wars Saga Edition or Genesys (FFG)?,"Hey folks! So, I've been diving back into Star Wars tabletop RPGs and can’t shake this question:  
👉 **Which system brings more** ***craft*****—more** ***juice*****, more** ***Star Wars power*****—to the table?**

I’m talking about that raw **energy**, that **mythic feel**, that **cinematic punch** we all imagine when we think of Star Wars. Whether it's the classic hero’s journey, Force philosophy, scoundrels dodging blaster fire, or epic starfighter battles—what system delivers the *whole* Star Wars experience better?

Here’s where I’m at:

* **Saga Edition (D20)** is a beast. It’s crunchy, tactical, and leans into the D&D DNA. It gives you a kind of ""Knights of the Old Republic"" vibe—heroic, detailed, and pretty customizable. Lightsaber duels feel technical, and there’s a lot of depth to character builds if you like that structured gameplay.
* **FFG’s Genesys system (Edge of the Empire, Age of Rebellion, Force and Destiny)** is wild and cinematic. It’s all about narrative flow, big swings, and fast-moving stories. The dice system can make things feel unpredictable and exciting, like the chaos of a desperate escape from an Imperial Star Destroyer. It has rules for Morality, Obligation, and Duty—perfect for capturing different sides of the Star Wars mythos.

What I’m asking is:  
👉 Which game gives you that *goosebumps* Star Wars feeling?  
👉 Which one makes *Force users* feel mystical and powerful, and smugglers feel scrappy but lucky?  
👉 If you had to run the *ultimate Star Wars campaign*, which system would you trust to do it?

Both systems have their strengths, but I’m curious what others think. Give me your hot takes, your war stories, your ""I shot first!"" moments!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x280442bd0>,rpg,1742141606.0
1jcnm7z,Am I overwhelming my DM?,"EDIT: Thank you so much for the feedback. Yea, i guess I got carried away a little and got a bit overexcited about making the character. I shall tone it down a a bit... a bit more 😅 From what I gathered, the character should have plenty of potential to grow during the campaign, as the background serves more as a way to set the fundamentals of the character and their goals, and I can keep all the extra stuff to myself (i'll 100% make like a wiki or something for my character, cause i think it'd be fun). I am in no way intending to change my DM's story, plot and lore, that's why I sent him all that stuff just to make sure it fits, as I'm entering the game mid campaign, after the party has already done some stuff and are lvl 3 already, and got kind of discouraged when he wasn't as excited as I was.
I actually sent him a message to apologise, promised to just give him the essentials (and asked him what he needs), and asked him if I can, for the future, clarify with him some bits about my character so that she's not far removed from the lore and logic of the game universe.

---

A friend of mine invited me to join in the middle of an ongoing DnD campaign that he's the DM of. In all my life I've only played like 2 sessions of DnD (where he was also the DM), but due to life we had to abandon that particular campaign.

Anyhow, the thing is: I've started developing my character and I might've overdone it a bit with the questions I send my friend (it's a homebrew story, so I wanted to get myself pretty immersed in the universe in order to make an authentic character; didn't really help either that my character is a custom race that he made up, so he is the only source of information on that). He answered those questions nonetheless, so we're kind of okay here.

I'm a really passionate person when it comes to making characters, OCs, etc, and I want them to feel like they're an actual person within the universe, with wants, likes, dislikes, solid personalities, and flaws and a backgorund and backstory. I also want my characters to be easily visualiseable, so I tend to make them pretty detailed and complex.

So I was checking in with my DM friend today, sending him some info about my character (like how I saw her having been in the scouting brigade of her tribe, dealing with threats as a ranger, but she lost her eye due to a curse pit on her people, so her depth perception was warped, so she had to step down and now she only goes on patrols and doesn't really take part in the action anymore. And asking him if her bow type would fit, as I took inspiration from the historically accurate bow Odysseus used, and I told my friend that I was thinking that my character wouldn't really be sneaky, as her bow makes a lot of noise due to the tension of the string, etc) The info was comprised of a few paragraphs.

The way he responded was a very exasperated and bothered ""Oh my god"" and sending me a 💀 emoji, telling me he didn't read any of it, but remarking that I just sent him a whole freaking book.

I don't want to make just ""Steve the barbarian that likes to hit things"" and I want my character to have depth and a background within the story.

Should I just tone it down, with a less developed character, or like, keep the ""useless"" details to myself and tell him only the most completely utterly important essentials?

Not to mention, I'm a very anxious and shy person, so roleplaying is not my forte and I will have to acclimate to it, so having a well established character is helping me get into the story more and portray my character more easily.

Is it a me problem? Or a him problem? Or a both of us problem?

I'm familiar with other implementations e.g. supply in Heart and Ironsworn, but I've settled on my own thing for now at least.

I've written up the [full details of the 'supply die'](https://murkdice.substack.com/p/the-supply-die), but in short: it's a step dice chain that can generate supply complications either as it depletes or when it runs out, which are then handled in an NSR-y/FKR-y manner.

1jcfeiy,Open Table Sessions - advice wanted,"I need your advice.

We have been running open world, open table D&D sessions for a year and a half.

All the players started at level 1 and in the same starting town and adventuring guild. Each month, DMs run a one shot and all characters return to town 
They are good for these reasons:
- the one shots allow players to drop in, drop out, play when they can and not be excluded because different groups are on different adventures that it doesn't make sense to turn up in halfway through.
- the players and DMs can mix and match each session so many people get to meet and play with each other and that builds the community.
- DMs don't have to run every session. That allows the DMs to rest, play or just skip. No pressure and the adventures continue even if some DMs are away.

However, there are downsides.
-characters don't get spotlighted for that personal drama feeling that many modern players love.
- disconnected one shots can feel like the world/the narrative doesn't progress.
- the tone of the world can vary greatly based on DM (not necessarily a problem).

From next year, we'll start again from level 5 in a new setting.
Where should we set it? I'm thinking Greyhawk.

Here's what I want to do more of to create coherence between the DMs and consistency in the world so there can be progress and the players feel their characters affect the world:

- have a shared world map that players fill in.
- have well-defined factions that have faction turns between each session and can be affected by players.
- have players propose the adventures.

What else can I do to improve our shared world, open table gaming sessions?

For the record, this post isn't meant to be self-deprecating. I'm at peace with my personality. I'm just being frank about reality.  I'm not a very charismatic person. I tend to be reserved, socializing isn't easy for me, and (at least outwardly) I'm kind of serious. I'm not very creative and even worse at anything that involves being put on the spot. Nobody will ever accuse me of being the personality hire. 

I think all those things are the reason I  love immersing myself in fantasy worlds and am curious about RPGs. But, I typically need those fantasy worlds pre-created and handed to me. If we're being realistic, I dont think I'll be really ""good"" at it. But I think I would enjoy it.

 I've been researching for awhile now and have found posts complaining about other players that aren't good at or aren't comfortable with fully diving into the role play aspect and how that negatively influences the experience of others. 

So, I'm looking for honest opinions. I don't have a built in friend group to play with that might be more tolerant/accepting of my quirks. I'd have to join in with strangers. The last thing I want to do is bring down the experience for others.

As the title says, I'm looking for system recommendations, I'll do the best I can to supply information. I'm looking at taking over the next campaign for our group of 6 (5 players). I have played several systems over the years but they have all been pretty mainstream and I'm totally unaware of the vasty majority of systems that are out there. I'll describe down below what I'm looking for and hopefully ya'll can give me some ideas that fit the bill. If D&D or Pathfinder end up being the best option, then so be it.

**Setting:**  
I already have a story in mind that I want to tell. Ideally, it's a fantasy setting that has magic, goblins, demons, angels, etc. My setting is meant to feel dark, but not necessarily a horror theme. I draw inspiration from the Diablo franchise if that helps.

**What we have played:**  
D&D 5E and Hunter: The Reckoning

**What I'm looking for:**  
Not super crunchy (not more crunchy than 5E even though I mentioned Pathfinder above, lol)  
Fantasy  
Straight forward combat and spell casting  
Character development so each player feels unique to the other  
Great for story telling  
Not a super lethal setting (I want the players to be able to take a hit)

**Bonus point for (but not necessary):**  
Dark  
Emphasis on gear  
Professions that are impactful
