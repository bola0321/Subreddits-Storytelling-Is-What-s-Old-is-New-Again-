I`m at my wits end trying to find a pack/collection of round token images to print out and glue on wooddisks for my osr games. There are tons of detailed and colorful omes out there, but simple, even down to completely black silhouettes, are impossible to find. Atleast as packs.

I need that standard monsters and some pc`s, nothing extremely fancy as long as they are suitable for 1‚Äù size prinitng on a laserprinter.

1jf7k9d,All Time Best Mega-dungeons for fun at the table AND usability?,"I'm currently a player in a Stonehell campaign and loving it! There's something special about that tense push-your-luck exploration of a massive hostile environment that hits all the right notes for me as a gaming experience.

Since I'm playing in Stonehell (and not running it), I'm looking to expand my mega dungeon collection for when I'm in the DM seat. I already own Gradient Descent and The Isle, which are in my future GM plans.

As a busy DM, I really value ease of use at the table and modules that require minimal prep. I know mega-dungeons can range from ""ready to run out of the box"" to ""requires a PhD seminar just to understand the basics"" (joking, but you know what I mean).

Features I particularly appreciate:

* Control-panel style layouts
* Information that I can grasp from a quick scan
* Minimal page-flipping during play

1jf5d81,"I just wrote a post on bringing new players into the OSR and tackling common objections, especially around character death. Check it out!","Yo good Peeps of Earthfordshire!

Jimmi here from [Domain of Many Things](https://www.domainofmanythings.com/) serving up my weekly ponderings, for your consumption and pleasure üòÅ This week - getting new players into the OSR.

In my experience, old-school play thrives on danger ‚ò†Ô∏è but I've found a real issue persuading people who've joined the hobby via 5e and stayed there to try it out, because they feel like their characters are doomed from the start, and won't have satisfying stories to tell.

Fair play to them if they really don't want to explore the wider TTRPG hobby, but there's a whole other world outside that gated 5e garden, just waiting for em.

A good OSR game can be brutal for sure, but it should also be fun, engaging, and give players a fighting chance - if they're smart.

In my latest bloggadowndiddlydoo, I dig into what makes OSR challenges feel fair rather than frustrating (and also use faaaar too many Matt Mercer gifs). I'm talking about empowering players to balance risk, giving them real choices, and making sure every death tells a story rather than just feeling like a dice-flavored slap in the chops.

1jf03id,Castle Amber Colossus encounter Homebrew variation,"I'm running my players through a chopped up version of Castle Amber and had them encounter the Colossus this week. 

Players are second level and I was looking for a way to run the encounter without just handing it to them or risking a TPK. Players seem to enjoy what I came up with. 

I decided there were cliffs with caves in the face in between the town and the direction the Colossus was coming from. I didn't want to hand this information to my players but one of them did ask about the neighboring terrain which was cool. 

After much discussion on strategy they decided to go scout out the caves and found they could access caves at various elevations from a ground level entrance. 

As they were strategizing that began to feel the ground shake and and debris falling from the cave ceilings.

One of the bards and the Paladin rode out to intercept the Colossus and lure it towards the caves with a homebrewed spell I call ""come hither"".

It took some doing to get its attention and get it to follow them but it chased them to the cave entrance where it reached in to try to grab them. Smashing its fist against the cliff-faced caused damage from falling debris to everyone (save for half damage)

The magic user and other bard we're up in one of the caves and the thief was on top of the cliff ready to repel down if needed. 

Magic user  got its attention with some attack spells, and The Bard played its instrument to draw it towards them. 

It's big old face was looking at the cave when the bard switched to the heralds trumpet they had gotten from the town loaded with the powder and successfully deployed it. (The second bard was chosen because they played a wind instrument so figured they had the strongest lungs, and the face of the 15-year-old player was priceless)

All in all it was fun to run. Took team effort and about an hour of strategizing before they executed their plan.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b7c055b0>,osr,1742399258.0
1jezpu2,Simplicity of B/X but with lots of character customization? Is there a system like this?,"Hi,

I know that usually player customization goes against simplicity and ease of creation. The moment you start adding a lot of different options during character creation you end with D&D 5e.

Nevertheless, I think there can be a way to both have simplicity and character customization. As a player, I like the idea of feats, being able to have very distinct abilities and seeing a nice progression.

I know ShadowDark offers some customization, but is random and is not like you have a lot of things to choose from.

Olde Swords Reign seem more aligned to what I want. But I think there is still room for more player customization.

I guess AD&D has a lot of customization, but people have describite it as a little clunky, with lots os different rules that sometimes don't match very well (sorry, I'm not an expert, surely AD&D has lot of really nice things to offer and I'm sure a lot of you are having tons of fun wiht it).

I also don't enjoy tactical combat that much. I prefer customization more in relation to exploration or narrative. I like feats like being able to breath under water or turning into a goblin. I don't care that much about complex combat manouvers.

I guess what I'm looking for is a system where you have an easy body of rules that are easy to understand but on top of that you have a detailed system of feats, aspects, magic, items, weapons; and its focus is not combat. Something that is easy to grasp but offers a lot of depth. 

Am I asking too much?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b7c3bc80>,osr,1742398272.0
1jezkmd,My players won't stop collecting teeth,"In our Mausritter campaign, I'd created a wizard's tower inhabited by a necromancer obsessed with teeth. He went by The Dentomancer. The Dentomancer made an offhand comment about bring willing to buy teeth off of them, and wasn't really interested in anything besides teeth. It was a hook for a sidequest, nothing more really. 

** I was a fool. **

What I thought was just a fun detail became a goal for one of my players. In his mind, teeth = gold = xp. Teeth have become a complex mechanic with numerous details and caveats. Each time he kills a creature he wants to know the monetary value of their teeth, spends time taking the teeth out of corpses, and asking if any creatures have unique teeth. 

This idea had spread to the rest of my players. They will often choose to engage in combat based solely off of tooth quantity and quality. I've had to Google the number of teeth for real life creatures pretty consistently, and there are now special teeth encumbrance rules. Each new type of tooth results in a new ruling. I'm a big believer in ""rulings not rules"" but they are pushing that philosophy to its limit. It has been six months of consistently tooth-based gameplay. 

The thing is the players have yet to return to the Dentomancer to cash in their teeth. I don't know what will happen when they do. It's not really that big a deal but I wish I had a real solution for this. What should I do?



TL;DR: My Mausritter players have become obsessed with collecting teeth for money, to the point it has become a significant mechanic. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b7c741d0>,osr,1742397906.0
1jeucoq,Always letting the players be able to run away?,"Is this sort of an OSR tenet?

On the other hand, from the standpoint of the type of play one wants to encourage, I think the idea is that you want the players exploring and pushing boundaries, so you want to more easily give them an out? I don‚Äôt know.¬†

1jete1f,How to handle wizard spells?,"I am very new to OSR. My group comes from mainly PbtA and other ""story"" games but I am very interested in the storytelling potential of OSR and have roped my group into playing Shadowdark  -- mainly because of how easy it was to get started with that system. I'm running modules from tenfootpole's Best list. 

One of the things that inspired me to try the OSR style in the first place was this comment from a post from this sub about character progression:   
  
*But in an OSR game, there's no automatic spell progression-- they need to journey in and engage with the game world to find magic. Their spellbook becomes not an arbitrary series of choices, but a sort of trophy record for them. Every single spell was something they sought out, survived, and earned the ability to wield. That scorching ray? They had to best the necromancer of Skull Rock and pry the spellbook from his dead hands for that. Had to, because nothing was automatically handed to them over time.* 

This sounds very cool. I assume it's one of the 5e-isms of Shadowdark, but the wizard class does have a table of how many spells they're going to learn at each level, though they can also learn spells from scrolls. What I have been debating is whether to tell the wizard in my group that as they level up they won't be learning spells automatically, and that they're going to have to collect scrolls. My worry is that as the GM, I'm going to have to babysit the wizard having to make sure that they find scrolls everywhere as to not handicap them. Or just have a shop in town that sells the ""basic"" scrolls like Detect Magic, Featherfall and Magic Missile, but then that might kind of defeat the purpose and you might as well just let them learn spells automatically on level-up. 

Now I assume that this question has been pondered and answered a million times either on here or on various blogs, but I haven't found it, so I would really appreciate if you could point me towards a solution.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b7c98950>,osr,1742378113.0

1jen99n,Stygian Library question,"For those who have run/played The Stygian Library, on page 11 it says ""When the players GO BACK, they travel back up the line to a previously visited Location. Probably on the previous layer, but the map can get complex as players double back and find paths linking disparate Locations."" Does the second sentence imply that if you have e.g. previously rolled the Boiler Room at depth 3, and then later the players go deeper from depth 10 and you roll the Boiler Room again, you draw a path from 10 -> 3 and they wind up back there again? Or is the ""paths linking disparate Locations"" referring to those random events that generate new paths, and you'd instead draw a path to a new Boiler Room at depth 11?

I assume it's the latter because otherwise I don't see how it would be possible for the party to get below depth 33 because you'd run out of locations, but just curious if anyone knows for sure.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b7bc3200>,osr,1742352497.0

Dungeon Cores are pretty much the Hearts of the Dungeon from computer games like the Dungeon Keeper series, or War for the Overworld. They're also quite popular in the LitRPG and Progression Fantasy genres of speculative fiction. (I'm currently really enjoying *The Cabin in Always Hungry*, a Dungeon Core Horror Slasher series on Royal Road, which I highly recommend)

The main concept is that every dungeon has a core or heart that is at least semi-aware. As it claims victims, loot, and experience, it levels up and its dungeon gains levels, becoming more deadly, and getting better loot to draw in delvers/victims.

This is something I was planning to extrapolate on in my *Points of Darkness* essay. But it suddenly struck me that someone might have beaten me to the punch and already created a class for dungeon cores",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b7d23350>,osr,1742294271.0

1jdj5de,On LotFP and genre,"I see here a fairly frequent assertion on this sub that LotFP is extreme horror akin to Martyrs or Terrifier. Which is absolutely the genre of its full color core book art, and seems to be the objective. But I don't think it's more image sparse black and white adventures really fall into that genre, because the whole genre of extremity requires a level of detail that the books' writing does not support, so when we without full color art it falls short of this genre aim. Primarily texture extreme horror requires more descriptive writing than most LotFP books have, and generally more space than most OSR adventures have room for. The main books I'm thinking of as comparison points are Stokoe's Cows and LaRocca's Things HaveGotten Worse Since We Last Spoke.

What I think LotFP adventures fall into more and why there is a divisive reaction to them is the hopeless and pointless nature of the horrible things rather than the extremity. More akin to the Descent, the Poughkeepsie Tapes, or the Smiles series than the grindhouse its art seeks to imitate. I personally think most (though not all) LotFP adventures miss the mark on what makes to of those three examples good and falls more into Smile territory, where the consequences are less of a ""how horrifying"" and more of a ""whomp whomp, anyways roll up new dudes"".

1jcnc7i,In defense of Keep on The Borderlands (and also a defense of Humanoid enemies),"I came across a thread a few weeks ago and I‚Äôve been ruminating on my thoughts for a while. The thread is locked so I couldn‚Äôt reply right then and there and I‚Äôm not sure where I even saw it or who this response is to but oh well, here I am.

 The main gist was ‚Äúwhy run keep on the borderlands? It‚Äôs boring, none of the enemies are interesting and they don‚Äôt even name any of the NPC‚Äôs.‚Äù Other people replied but no answer was sufficient (in my or the OP‚Äôs opinion.) 
I believe that KOTB is the perfect module to get someone to DM. That was the main purpose in the first place. The area is quite large with a lot of interesting little areas and room for the DM to flex their creativity. It leaves quite a bit open to slot into any campaign.

Aside from the faction play that really makes the caves of chaos so fun, having humanoids be the first real enemies allows both the players and the DM to understand the motives, tactics and mindset of what you are fighting. Big pig face dude and sneaky little boys are much easier for someone new to both TTRPGs and fantasy as a whole to understand than say, a gibbering mouther or xorn. 

We‚Äôve had decades upon decades of iterations on ttrpgs, lots of new creations and creativity on the scene and we are in an absolute deluge of new options. Why complain about the origins of the hobby?That‚Äôs where most of this started for a metric butt ton of people. Of course it‚Äôs tropey. It created the tropes! 

I guess I‚Äôm going to end this with a question. Other than time constraints, why does it seem like there are a lot of people who don‚Äôt understand that this is a game of imagination? Why are some people seemingly allergic to deviating from the books and making it their own? (And just to add some inflammatory statements, this question also goes for the Hispanic coded Orcs in the 5e art. If you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt add it. You aren‚Äôt beholden to the creator‚Äôs vision because once the book is yours, it‚Äôs your book. You‚Äôre the creator now.)

EDIT: I‚Äôm not sure if it was even in this sub. It may have been in r/rpg. All I know is that it popped into my feed and I don‚Äôt have the knowledge or resources to find it again. But yes, there are people who don‚Äôt like kotb.

1jcman5,Wolves Upon the Coast Session 2,"I recently started running *Wolves Upon the Coast*, and it‚Äôs one of the best RPG products I‚Äôve encountered. This blog series is my way of documenting the experience‚Äîboth to share insights and to help others discover this incredible campaign.

**Previous entries:**

* [Intro](https://www.sqyre.app/blog/wolves-intro)
* [Session 1 Summary](https://www.sqyre.app/blog/wolves-session-one)
* [Foundry setup](https://www.sqyre.app/blog/wolves-foundry)

**Session 2: The Wolves Make Landfall**

*Days:* 3-7 (player-facing)

*Dates:* 4/2-4/6 (GM-only info for tracking seasons and holidays)

**The Wolves**

* **Arnsteinn** ‚Äì Speaks Ruis, Brythonic, and Pictish.
* **Erik the Younger** ‚Äì Speaks Brythonic and Pictish.
* **Gorm** ‚Äì Originally named Coram O'Dorbog, renamed ""Gorm"" by the Pictish master. Speaks Ruis, Brythonic, and Pictish.
* **Iago** ‚Äì Speaks Pictish.

**The Journey Continues**

As the excitement of Gorm‚Äôs boast to return with the head of the gryphon faded, the Wolves began to plan how they might overcome such a dangerous foe. Asking around, they learned that the nearby hamlet of Cloyne was devoted to the Old Ways of the druids ‚Äî perhaps its people knew something about poisons? They set sail across the bay, arriving at the hamlet to find it populated mostly by children and the elderly, as the adults were at sea fishing.

The old folk were suspicious of the strangers, but assurances of peaceful intent ‚Äî and the promise that most of the Wolves would remain on the karvi ‚Äî won them permission to approach. The villagers offered hospitality in exchange for help with chores and minor repairs while they awaited the return of their headman. Iago, outed as a Christian, was exiled from the hamlet and stayed with the men on the boat. The Wolves were rewarded with a meal of unpleasant fish and turnip stew. Gorm threw out his back helping repair a roof but found comfort in the arms of a friendly young woman who soon made him forget his pains.

When the adults returned at day‚Äôs end, they met Beyf, the taciturn headman. The old folk vouched for the Wolves, and after some negotiation, Beyf agreed to lead them to the local druid in exchange for 100 silver from the gryphon's reward. The next morning, in heavy rain, they set out for the druid‚Äôs craggy peninsula.

The druid was a sight: skin and bones wrapped in feathered jewelry and a makeshift feather skirt barely covering his ass. He listened to their tale and, for payment, offered to brew a sleeping draught that could be applied to the beast‚Äôs skin to put it to sleep ‚Äî but only if they returned with a feather from the gryphon as part of the bargain. The Wolves agreed and made the muddy return journey to Cloyne.

The next day, rain still falling, the Wolves split up. Iago remained on the karvi, regaling the crew with dreams of founding Iagotown, where all men would be free. Arnsteinn returned to Culemwardern for supplies, securing large fish hooks and damaged nets that might work on a creature the size of a gryphon. Erik and Gorm braved the rain to fetch the sleeping draught from the druid.

Day Six brought fog, making the journey to Shoal ‚Äî an island known for treacherous waters ‚Äî too dangerous. The Wolves hunkered down and counted themselves lucky to no longer be thralls. The plan was set: they would sail to Shoal, bait the gryphon with Erik‚Äôs donkey, and dose the beast with the sleeping draught.

Day Seven dawned clear and warm. As they left the bay, another ship approached from the southwest, flying a red sword on a black background. The captain, a large red-bearded man, warned them away from Shoal. He introduced himself as Raghall the Red, a free captain from the city of Guthram across the channel in Albann, and invited the Wolves to join him and Queen Dar in the free city. The Wolves thanked him but made no promises, pressing on toward Shoal.

Shoal loomed ahead ‚Äî a towering spear of rock rising from a turbulent sea. The Wolves circumnavigated the island, searching for a landing spot. They managed to beach the karvi and haul the donkey halfway up the rocky slopes before the terrain became too steep. As the gryphon returned to its roost, they doused the donkey with the sleeping draught. Their own shouting was drowned out by wind and waves, but prodding the donkey made it bray loud enough to draw the gryphon‚Äôs attention.

With a bloodcurdling shriek, the beast launched from the pinnacle ‚Äî a true monster: crocodile head, wolf forelimbs, lion hindlegs, and eagle‚Äôs wings.

The session ended on a cliffhanger as battle was about to be joined!

**GM Thoughts on Session 2**

*General*

I was really happy with how much happened, even in our shorter Foundry sessions. The combination of the density of the *Wolves* sandbox and the light rules meant we were able to fly through scenes.

*Random Encounters*

As an old-school sandbox, *Wolves* has a robust set of random encounters for land and naval regions. I've been pre-rolling weather, wind, and encounters, which helps keep the game flowing instead of figuring things out on the fly.

*Reaction Rolls*

*Wolves* uses a common old-school mechanic, the **reaction roll**, to determine the disposition of NPCs. Roll 2d6 ‚Äî high results are friendly, low results hostile. I used reaction rolls liberally for the villagers, Beyf, and the druid. The dice were in the Wolves‚Äô favor, making for a smoother journey ‚Äî a trend that‚Äôs continued across several sessions.

*Saves vs. Tests*

*Wolves* has two mechanics for non-combat rolls: **Saves** and **Attribute Tests**. Climbing Shoal raised the question of which to use. In the spirit of **Rulings over Rules**, I ruled that since we'd started with Saves, we'd use them for the rest of the session and discuss the approach between sessions.

*Gryphon Design*

Luke Gearing‚Äôs *Wolves* bestiary takes familiar monsters and makes them weird. I was tempted to use his gryphon but decided to roll on tables from *The Monster Overhaul* by Skerples, which produced the crocodile-headed abomination. I want *Wolves* to push me out of my vanilla fantasy habits, and this weird hybrid was a perfect fit. Check it out on DTRPG [The Monster Overhaul](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/421868/the-monster-overhaul).

Next up I'll recap Session 3 which was the Wolves' battle with the Gryphon, a perilous climb, and reflections on player agency, rule adjudication, and game pacing.

As it says on the lid, The Nomicon contains tables for generating names.  Some tables have full names (e.g. Atafa or Ianizzo) while others have multiple parts that you combine (e.g. Curiondio or Mbadiwothi). Names are divided into chapters by either their intended use (e.g. divine names) or how they sound like (e.g. Anglish or N√∂rslik). The latter are based on how real-world names sound like but do not replicate them entirely (for historical names I recommend [Treasury of Archaic Names](https://www.acaeum.com/jg/OtherCompanies/RPGRealmTreasuryArchaicNames.html) and [The Everyone Everywhere List](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/89285/the-everyone-everywhere-list?affiliate_id=2150725)).

1jc5ttz,Priory of the Sunstruck - Adventure Hooks,"So continuing my push to keep myself writing by making myself publicly accountable. This week I did some more work polishing some key rooms in the module I am taking from DM binder notes to written page.

It is a longer post, detailing 2 rooms but the particular thought I wanted to share is pulled out from the rest of the post in the excerpt below:

""Another aside - I am really having an internal debate about the role of hooks in an adventure. I know the classic ""TSR"" style is to have a bunch of hooks to be rolled randomly at the beginning of the adventure. It feels like a quantity over quality approach though. If I'm going to write a module and then put it out into the world for someone else to drop into their game then shouldn't I give 1 or 2 really solid hooks that are sure to catch their player's attention? And to me, a great hook has to HAVE A PAYOFF. Don't do fake hooks. Don't do generic hooks. Don't do hooks if the players bite they are underwhelming. Yay, gold! Who cares, wherever they go there will be gold. That's the point of the game.

GIVE THEM A MAGIC SWORD! If you give them a magic sword, the next time you throw a hook their way you know what they are going to do? They are going to bite. Every. Single. Time. Just keep giving them swords.

But you know what, I didn't just give them a sword. I gave them an NPC to interact with. I gave them an enemy - the Duke wants that sword. I gave them a choice, what can they get in return if they give the sword back to the Duke? I gave them questions. Who is this duke? Is he a good guy? It's a whole story that can be explored. At minimum its a new entry on the wandering monster table where occasionally some hired thugs from this random Duke somewhere else in the world show up and try to take the sword. Maybe the Peacock Blade wants to go back? Maybe Duke and Peacock Blade are in love?""

1jbyge6,System for content unlocking,"I‚Äôm going to run an OSE game starting with the Classic rules.

It‚Äôs going to be a status quo hex-crawl n a dungeon strewn wilderness, death trap type game where characters will die frequently.

I was thinking it would be fun to offer a tree or list of unlockable content, like new races, spells, classes, gear, and optional rules.  These new bits of content would be available to the players after the party does something to trigger their availability.

Triggers for unlocking could be discoveries, leveling, or forming alliances.  Sources for the new content would be Advanced OSE, Carcass Crawler, and homebrew/internet.

Has anyone done anything similar I can look at, or have suggestions for making this successful?

1jby5ie,Dark & Darker - a video game you can check if you need to scratch that itch,"I've recently come across this game called **Dark and Darker** and gave it a go when I wanted to play video game with old-school dungeon delving theme. 

You basically choose a class, get your starting gear and delve into a dungeon you explore and loot. You keep a map of the dungeon of areas you visit, you have a torch and all that jazz, and chests which you can check in, merchants, etc.  

I've raided (unsuccessfully and died) a Goblin Cave by myself --but it supports co-op so that's also possible. It's free-to-play for now so no harm in trying, if you're looking for something to scratch that itch. It's still in early access so beware.

First impression is that it can be a good way to get your dose, when you cannot play tabletop.

You can get the game for free on Steam - https://www.darkanddarker.com/

Unfortunately, I also found out in my wanderings that the creator is explicitly Islamophobic, or at least was when he was blogging many years ago. Seems like he has left the hobby.

Each round the player would declare their mighty deed, much like in DCC,  If the player rolled a natural 18 or higher and hit the opponent the the deed would be successful.  I know when we played our short lived DCC campaign that was one of the mechanics that the players really liked.   What do you think of introducing this?  Does the way I have it laid out work?  I am trying to not use additional dice, like in DCC. should I incorporate the 1d4 as a random modifier instead of fixed modifier and if it hits on a 4 (level 1) the mighty deed hits.

1ja9gru,Mass combat events in OSR setting,"Hi,

i'm playing Hot springs island using Dragonbane. This is an OSR setting about multiple factions wanting different things and the players characters come in the middle and basically alter the status quo.

There are some random events that might involve battles between factions, and some battles can have a large number of participants (up to 50). I'm looking for a way to manage that **without standard initiative-based combat** (which the characters wouldn't survive) but still allow some decisionmaking and interesting results for the players.

I was considering implementing ad-hoc moves like pbta, but i'm having a hard time since in normal encounters the characters already have their hands full with one or two enemies, and it would stretch credibility to have good rolls solve too much. Plus, they are not commanding anything right so it's not they can order other warriors arounds.

**Are there any easy, narrative but still character-influenced systems i can bolt on for this?**  
I am imagining something like ""select up to 3 bad things to happen to you in exchange for equivalent number of combat objectives to achieve"" but a little more indepth or nuanced.

1) How they should work in a different way than Psionics mechanically? In theory they should have less control over more powerful effects but that seems like a bad design.  
2) How effects should look so they don't still seem like ""space magic""? Temporal and space-bending effects are sci-fi enough but are pretty niche.

Most of the content is based on Gary's notes:

> **Who is Writing It?**
> Volume 1, _The Citadel_ is written by Gary Gygax. This is the content some of you have in Yggsburgh, previously published by Troll Lord Games in 2004; it will contain updated art on the cover and interior, plus new maps.
> 
> Volume 2, _The Castle_ is written by Jeffrey Talanian. This originally appeared in Upper Works, published by Troll Lord Games in 2008. It will also feature an updated cover and new interior art, as well as new maps for more seamless play.
> 
> Volume 3, _The Cellars_ includes one level written by Jeffrey Talanian (the 1st). The rest is being written by Michael Stewart. Mike has written and published a number of adventures through Troll Lord Games, and his writing style fits Castle Zagyg perfectly. Couple that with his work on Yggsburgh alongside Gary Gygax, and he is the perfect candidate for the task. He is back on board to pore over Gary's original notes and maps and to create the dungeon that many of us have longed for, and many more never knew they wanted. 

Castle Zagyg will be published for the TLG's [Castles & Crusades system](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/86/troll-lord-games/category/44934/castles-and-crusades-fantasy-roleplaying?affiliate_id=2150725), meaning it is broadly compatible with TSR's D&D editions and other popular retroclones.

1j8znbx,Clipping lanterns to belts,"For games set in typical medieval fantasy settings, would you allow lanterns to be clipped to a belt or another article of clothing? I think the normal assumption in OSR play is that you need a free hand to wield a light source so I wanted to see how other DMs ruled this.

I can imagine a few reasons why it wouldn't be common to do this IRL (I believe modern lanterns don't suffer these issues, but medieval lanterns might?):

* Being too close to the body could mess with the air intake, dimming the flame
* The heat generated may be too uncomfortable to stay clipped so close to the body for long
* The contents may slosh around too much, potentially accidentally dousing the flame

If none of the above are enough to outright prevent lanterns from being clipped, I would imagine that there's the possibilities that a fall or solid hit in combat could cause the lantern to shatter and the burning oil to damage the wielder",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b8b3d310>,osr,1741722228.0

1j8vjl1,"Hey, I have a question: How would you develop the concept of integration between teams?","



I run casual adventures on the AD&D 2e/1e system for four teams of adventurers and I noticed that within 1 discord server a micro community started to grow, recently I was interested in their conversation about ankhegs and whether damp earth conducts electricity and whether it can also conduct paralysis from one of the wands and that it would be cool to test it sometime



Since let's call it team A was in the dungeon and team B in the wild, I agreed that this time it could be done beyond the narrative of giving the created artifact to team B and paying them for the tests





Then the concept of a channel on Discord for exchanging magic items was born for me, which allowed me to stop being afraid that the artifacts that the BG would encounter would be too useless. After 48 sessions and a full year of RPG company, I managed to make 5 such exchanges and 11 orders, 8 of which were completed.

1j8uddd,Swords and Wizardry question,"I ran a session 0 of swords and wizardry complete on Saturday, and there were a few places where the players had questions and the rules didn't seem to answer.

1. During the movement and missile phase, can players move some distance fire a missile and then move again? I couldn't find anything that outright said no, and the only hint was that it says movement, or missile attack once in the quick rundown of the phases, but in the longer explanation of the phase it doesn't seem to make it either/or. Since we are all 5e players and a turn is a whole minute I ruled it was OK.

2. If you use a missile attack, can you then use a melee attack? Again I didn't see anything specifying one action per turn, and the only hint is that some missile weapons allow for more than one attack in a turn. I ruled it was okay for now, since a turn is a minute, and it seems very possible for someone to do both in 1 turn if they want.

I know OD&D is rulings over rules and the original white box wasn't very specific itself so in general I made the assumption that it's up to me to decide, but if there is a rule in the book and I didn't find any answers I just went with what was fun for the table.

1j8tp4m,OSE - THAC0 vs AAC difference??,"In the **Classic: Characters** booklet, there is a short paragraph of the optional use of Ascending AC:

>Note: Using Ascending Armour Class results in very slightly different attack probabilities than when using the traditional approach of descending AC with an attack matrix.

For the love of all that is Holy, somebody please explain to me how THAC0 and Ascending AC can result in different probabilites.

Also, the **Classic: Adventures** booklet says the following about using THAC0 directly (subtracting monster AC from THAC0 and using that as the target to hit with the attack roll):

>Note: Using THAC0 to resolve attack rolls results in very slightly different attack probabilities than when using the traditional approach of referring to the attack matrix.

How? How on Earth would it result in different probabilities?

**Example:**

A 4th level Fighter THAC0: 17 \[+2\] wants to hit a Goblin AC: 6 \[13\]

Using the attack matrix: To hit DAC 6 with a THAC0 of 17, you need to meet or beat 11

Using THAC0 directly: you need to meet or beat THAC0 - DAC = 17 - 6 = 11

Using Ascending AC: To hit AAC 13 with an attack bonus of +2, you need to meet or beat 11

1j8sgf5,Advancement in Knave/Knave hacks,"Hi team, I'm an experienced RPG player relatively new to OSR. After running my first few one shots of Knave 1e, I thought it was the perfect system for my latest homebrew RPG project - a game with anthropomorphic woodland animal races and dark fantasy flavours, like Redwall meets a Jim Henson film. I wrote it all up, made my PDF with interim art, created my character sheets and ran my first playtest session with a few friends. 

After running my first sesh (a raccoon had stolen a book of Raise Dead from an ancient wizard's crypt, using skeletons to steal from a nearby village) I had a great time, but encountered a problem. After divvying up all the coin found, each player came out with 166XP, which really didn't seem right - Knave advocates for level up every 1000XP, which seems ages away. 

I may not have put enough loot in there for a level 1 mission, but I'm already thinking of reducing the level caps and adding extra ""do-gooder"" bonuses for milestones reached and NPCs helped along the way. I believe this would foster and reward a sense of community banding together in dark times - a principle theme of a woodland critter game.

My problem is, basically you always will want to rest.

1j8mgmk,Hex mapping software,"\--SOLVED--  
There's a hex map extension for Inkscape ( [https://github.com/lifelike/hexmapextension](https://github.com/lifelike/hexmapextension) )and although I do have to draw the symbols myself, it's propably the best option at the moment. Simple enough to use, at least, if you're at all familiar with Inkscape (or even Illustrator, thought they do have different workflow and UI, you should pick up Inkscape relatively easily if you know Illustrator (I know I did)).  
I tried it for a moment, and it's easy to snap the symbols to the center of the hex. Now all I have to do is start making the map symbols...

I am looking for a hex mapping software, one that I can download and use from my computer. Worldographer is not the one I want based on the trial version, it feels clumsy and awkward to use with quite the learning curve. Is there any alternatives?  
I'd like to make OSR style maps, so fe. Inkarnate or Wonderdraft are not what I want either. I should just be able to plop map symbols on hex grid. I've made something with Inkscape, but with that I have to center the symbols by hand, not to mention I have to draw them which is not a huge issue, but the need to center the symbols manually is a deal breaker. Might there be some plugins or somethign for Inkscape that does the trick?  
I've been looking around for some time now, and it seems that there isn't a downloadable software that does this simple trick, or am I completely wrong? I would rather not draw them by hand, be it on paper or computer.  
In the meantime, waiting for responses, I'll look into the Inkscape options. I have some idea how to approach, but it might requite a bit of prep.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b8be4fe0>,osr,1741683686.0

1j7wcu8,"OSR News Roundup for March 10th, 2025","Welcome to the second news roundup of March. My apologies to subscribers; I realized belatedly that I neglected to send out the newsletter last Monday. I had an immensely shitty day and it just got away from me.

I'm getting excited about the upcoming crowdfunding project I'll be launching in April for [**Mind Over Matter**](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/third-kingdom-games/osr-advanced-psionics?preview_token=nbbiRuFK64e), a psionics book for Old School Essentials and other OSR games. In addition to a fairly traditional psionics system, albeit one divorced from point-based activation, it will also include an adaptation of the classic Book of Nine Swords from late in the 3.5-era. I've always liked the concepts presented in that book, and I've reworked the rules to fit in with an OSR mindset and power scaling.

Enough about me, though. The big news from last week that I'm sure many of you have heard already is that Drivethrurpg will be raising prices on certain print on demand products, chiefly softcover books, some of which will see a price increase of up to 70%! I don't know yet how this will affect POD books from other vendors, or offset books from other sources, but it has been my experience that prices almost never *go down*. I hope that people who are in the middle of crowdfunding campaigns aren't negatively affected by the upcoming pricing increases, and for everyone else, I guess now is the time to purchase those POD titles that have been sitting in your cart.

* I've mentioned before my love of the games coming out of Latin America these days, and I was stoked to see that the [**LATAMjam 2025**](https://itch.io/jam/rpg-latam-jam-2025) is starting on March 12th. You don't have to be a LATAM creator to participate, so long as your entry uses a ruleset designed or released by an eligible publisher. The depth of creativity coming out of this community is truly astounding, and I'm excited to see what comes out of this game jam.
* Matt Kelly has released [**Stormalong**](https://bymattkelly.itch.io/stormalong), a collection of seafaring adventures for Cairn, Into the Odd, and other systems, all based on American folktales.
* [**Scouts and Scoundrels**](https://writer-ben.itch.io/scouts-and-scoundrels) is a free, rules-lite rpg based on Cairn, with some super cute artwork.
* I've mentioned [**Block, Dodge, Parry** ](https://dicegoblingames.itch.io/block-dodge-parry)several times, and was excited to get the notification that the final version is out on itch. It's designed as an ""advanced"" companion to Cairn, and is available now for a lower price before it jumps up to the regular price. I've been following the development, and it's a really neat system in its own right, and in my opinion really brings a shine to the (fairly basic) Cairn.
* [**Vesta Mandate**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/storygames-chicago/vesta-mandate) is a neat-looking game of political intrigue in the future that is currently funding on Kickstarter.
* Vaults of Vaarn has a soft spot in my heart, and I just saw that [**Ecophage**](https://chaotic-goods.itch.io/ecophage) is a newly released adventure for VoV, dealing with an escaped scientific experiment causing havoc.
* I've mentioned before that Goblin Errands is one of Sabre's bestselling titles, and I just saw there's a similar (perhaps a bit darker) project funding on Kickstarter: [**Rob'n Goblin**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spielknights/robn-goblin) is a heist game which looks to be a bit of Honey Heist mixed with Goblin Errands mixed with the newly released Dawn of the Orcs ([**which we have in stock!**](https://www.sabregamesandcards.com/product-page/dawn-of-the-orcs-lyme-and-plasmophage))

* [**Attack the Light Issue #0**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/514560/attack-the-light-issue-0?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473) is the flagship offering of a new series of zines by Michael Putlack, written for Shadowdark. I had the pleasure of interviewing Michael several years ago for a project they launched for ZineMonth, and it's cool seeing them continuing to publish product (full disclosure, Michael currently works for the Arcane Library, publisher of Shadowdark).
* I've mentioned before how much I like seeing a product that I've mentioned in the promotional stages make it to publication, and I just saw that [**Miami 86**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/513847/miami-86-rpg?src=newest_recent&affiliate_id=253473) is live on Drivethru.

1j7t0zp,Was 5e originally considered a triumph for the old school?,"I was watching the interview between Ben Milton and Mike Mearls, and at one point, Ben mentioned that when 5e first launched, the OSR community initially saw it as a victory for their style of play‚Äîbut over time, that perception soured.  

I wasn‚Äôt around the OSR at the time‚ÄîI only discovered it after 2020‚Äîbut that idea resonates with me. Even before I became disillusioned with 5e and moved toward OSR games, I remember 5e in 2014 feeling much closer to the experience I wanted. It wasn‚Äôt so much the original system that pushed me away, but how both the system and its community evolved over time. A Knight at the Opera [wrote a post that](https://knightattheopera.blogspot.com/2024/10/in-mouth-of-madness.html) really captured my feelings on this shift. Even now, I feel like I'd be happy to run a campaign using *Into the Unknown,* or even 2014 PHB-only with some hacks.  

So, for those who were active in the OSR back in 2014: Does Ben‚Äôs description of the community‚Äôs reaction sound accurate? If so, did the OSR community ultimately reject 5e because their initial reaction was inaccurate in ways that become more clear over time; or did the game start in a place that mostly aligned with OSR sensibilities before drifting away?

Pangea Ultima is¬†a proposed supercontinent that will form in about 250 million years when the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas merge.¬†It's also known as Pangaea Proxima, Neopangaea, and Pangaea II.¬†

*---*

I ran *Through Ultan's Door* (issue 1) for my gang as an interlude from playtesting [our far crunchier game](https://incunabuli.com/rulebook/).

For it, I cobbled together [CRIMINAL](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qsMWcADCtmszFL_4Sp8y6t_8GIxh6HVH0suAe5KbhQU/edit?usp=sharing), a one-page rogues-only hack of the [1d6 thieving rules](https://tsojcanth.wordpress.com/2010/03/20/1d6-thieving/) from Paulo Greco and the [dueling rules](https://cavegirlgames.blogspot.com/2018/06/duels-in-osr.html) by Emmy Allen, both featured in *Knock!*.

(Technically, it's 3 pages right now, but pages 2‚Äì3 are player-facing campaign notes/materials)

**The vibe:** An all-rogues party. Sneakthieves, alley cats, bouncers, and street-duelists with a tenuous grasp on a loot-driven life.

Four sessions in, it delivers simplicity, rapid progression, and a clear, fast gameplay loop of ""get in, get loot, get out, regear, level up, repeat."" The barely-there city setting of *TUD* (which I elected to make a hodgepodge of renaissance Venice and Edo) serves as a minimalist, safe home base to populate with *Diablo*\-style vendors, shop stocks updated with new gear once a session.

One issue in, the oldschool vibe has kicked in hard. The pieces fall neatly together. We will see how it holds up for Issue 2 and the broadening scope of the Great Sewer River.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b8d14b60>,osr,1741554862.0

I read a bit into other systems too. PF2e, 5e, Conan, Worlds woithout number, OSR, fate...

One of my players has a huge library of old dnd 3.0-3.5e adventures that we would still like to use.  
  
**So what I am looking for is a system that creates less work for me as a DM compared to 3.5 but has also a better design (buff stacking, imbalance etc) while making it easy to adapt 3.0e or 3.5e adventures into it.**

1j72pjd,How OSR are spell points?,"So, OSR play is very largely about resource management and having spells be just another resource. Vancian magic is a very baked in thing for that, but I feel like enthusiasm for Vancian magic has really waned in the OSR scene. Roll to cast is increasingly used in popular games like DCC and Shadowdark (I believe). I, too, am wondering how necessary or integral Vancian magic is for the OSR experience.

I'm currently interested in the possibilities of a spell point system. What I envision is a pool of spell points that recovers over time, rather than the Vancian way of getting everything back overnight (or rather, by memorizing spells in the morning). You'd probably get a small fixed percentage back per hour. I think the idea is that mages sort of take in ambient energy/magic/whatever and expend it in the form of spells. 

There'd be neat little ways this would work with classes and ability scores, such as a ""Healer"" class casting healing spells for half the spell points but casting offensive spells for double the cost (taken straight from Elder Scrolls: Arena), and high prime requisite spellcasters getting bonus spell points rather than XP progression bonuses.

So, how compatible or incompatible do you think such a system would be with the OSR experience? Classic D&D is all about the ticking clock of resources being expended over the adventuring day, so I could see spell points that gradually recover over time (but not easily refilling) taking away from that. Plus, D&D's lurching progression of skyrocketing in power after getting milestone spells like Fireball would not be a feature of this game. 

I think a benefit of this system would be for spellcasters to not just be out of magic for the entire day. You can always portion it, but if you use it all in a key encounter, you could potentially recover enough for some more minor magic in a few hours. I think there could be interesting resource management aspects to that regarding which spells you cast and when. 

Plus, I think spell creation could be easier and maybe even systemitized if it was point based. 

What do you think? Do you think spell points would add or detract from the OSR experience? Let me know. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b8d8dbe0>,osr,1741506478.0

1j6rrhv,The Unhallowed Sea,"Been working on some Cosmology for my campaign setting(Celestria). [The Unhallowed Sea ](https://dragonsdrinkfree.com/2025/03/08/the-unhallowed-sea/)is where Devils call home within my setting. Fair warning my writing tends to be a little ramble-y, and I definitely use the word ""Devils"" way to often in this...but overall I'm happy with the concepts behind it.

Beyond the material plane lies a quiet place. A somber plane of existence where Devils dwell and an eternal fog covers a quiet sea which connects scattered islands. Though the Unhallowed sea seems a restful place at first glance, its eerie expanse is one of great danger. Beneath the calm pale waters leviathans dwell, and the islands that break up the expanse are the domains of Devils.

# The Devils of the Sea

Devils are beings of Law and contract. They bargain for the souls of mortal beings, striking complex deals in exchange for a sentence to be served by the soul after death. It is said that no Devil may pen a contract in which a soul is bound eternally. Each contract has a stipulated term of purgatory before a soul will be released to whatever after plane they are drawn. That said, while a Devil will never break letter of their contract they are masters of complex logic and precise dealings, their contracts are trapped with tricks and loopholes that extend and obscure the length of a souls sentence. Few souls who find themselves bound to a Devils power ever see themselves released. This trickery is vitally important to them, for Devils grow in power only through accumulation of bound souls. The more souls they have bound, and the longer those souls remain bound the more powerful a Devil becomes.

Devils gather themselves into Firms. Coalitions of service in which one or two elder Devils are at the top, and many others serve under them. Lesser Devils serve under the elder Devils of the firm, giving up the majority of the power earned through a souls acquisition in exchange for the protection and guidance of those above them. All Devils dream of the day they are either promoted to Partner within their firm, or instead have gained enough power and influence to strike it out alone and form their own Firm.

When Devils form a form it manifests as a physical space within the Unhallowed Sea. An island birthed into the fogs. As the firm gains more souls, and by extension more power and influence Their island grows, the sea ever shifting, reshaping, expanding and contracting to fit the needs of the the islands found within its waters. The greater the power held by a Firm the more distant it is able to stay from other islands within the sea. Additionally the fog grows more thick around their island, and more difficult to traverse. This is of vital importance for Rival firms are always looking to steal contracts and by extension the souls that are tied to it.

# The Leviathans below

While the Devils and their Islands represent a great danger to any that find themselves within the Unhallowed sea they are not the ONLY danger. Beneath the waters is the realm of the lost. The hunting grounds of great leviathans.

A devil without a Contract is no Devil at all. This is the very reason lesser Devils allow themselves to be tied into service. For without the power of bound souls to draw sustenance from a Devil starves. Sometimes occurs because they have had their contracts stolen. Sometimes because a Firm casts them out (a fate even Elder Partners are not always immune to). Sometimes it is because a foolish Devil may have over extended themselves, drawing forth more power than they had access to in hopes that they would be able to leverage that power to win big in the long run and the bet doesn't pay off, Burning out the souls in their possession and leaving the Devil in question powerless.

When this happen Devils have three choices (or perhaps two choices, and a consequence): They may Find another Firm, Find another Contract, Or wither into a husk and be thrown out like trash. The third possibility is where leviathans come into being. Devils cannot truly die, but being without a soul to draw sustenance from is a torment beyond comprehension. It leads to madness. The remnants of Devils cast into the Unhallowed sea roam there eternally seeking sustenance. Mindless beasts twisted in desire and shape. They can never regain themselves. Never again be what any Self respecting Devil would ever describe as ""A Devil"". But even that is not the end.

As clever and careful as Devils are in their contracts, and the defense of the souls under their power. Sometimes mistakes happen. Sometimes souls that should be bound manage to slip through the cracks. A stolen contract that is lost before it reaches a new Firm's vault. A contract that had an unexpected exit clause that leaves a soul without serving its sentence(and by extension release) while also no longer being held captive. And sometimes unbound souls from outside the unhallowed sea come into the plane for reasons of their own, but become lost. For whatever the reason sometimes souls find their way into the depths of those pale quiet waters‚Ä¶ At which point all too often they are found and devoured by those remnants of Devils long gone to madness.

Feasting upon the lost souls allows those husks to regain power, but it is not a stable, long lasting power granted by a contract. Devouring lost souls is a savage, feral feast which sates their hunger for only a short time. The husks regain strength, becoming twisted monstrosities referred to as Leviathans. These beasts form their own ecosystem. Fighting for hunting grounds, devouring what souls they can, and devouring each other whenever possible. Few husks last long enough to fully achieve ""Leviathan"" status, as they themselves are fair game for whatever elder Leviathans might happen to find them.

Though they have not the delicate and precise power of Devils at their best, leviathans can grow to be of massive size and power. Some Devils of great power have themselves gone missing in the endless for of the Unhallowed sea, devoured by beasts from below.

Though their exact nature is hard to quantify it is said that if you can manage to ""slay"" one of the beasts you may carve away draw out its potent blood, carve away its flesh, and take its bones. All of which are enriched by great power and are of great value to those with the knowledge to make use of them. of course since no devil can truly die, even a leviathan corpse can be returned to the sea where it may itself be devoured by another, or perhaps will someday reconstitute itself to begin its growth again.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b8b16a80>,osr,1741470123.0

1j647sw,Does anyone else feel like the scene is getting stale?,"Not a rant, nor complaining, I‚Äôm trying to spark discussion. 

Does anyone else feel like the OSR scene is getting stale? I feel like I see way fewer blog posts nowadays, and that every recent product release is either:

1) A rehash of a game (often OSE or Mork Borg)we already have with a few house rules. 

2) An art piece masquerading as a TTRPG product. Utterly unusable at the table and only hood to look at. 

Maybe I‚Äôm just out of the loop but it seems like we‚Äôre getting so much less new and creative stuff nowadays. That‚Äôs not to say that there‚Äôs nothing new and creative (Crowns 2e is cool!), just that the days of endless truly creative stuff is gone. 

Truly, I fear that we have reached the end point of commercialization in our niche hobby. It is easier and more lucrative to appeal to TTRPG book collecters rather than TTRPG player, and thus we see more and more product focused at them. 

Or matbe I‚Äôm full of doom and gloom. Perhaps I have rose tinted glasses on for the past. I was not there after all, so perhaps I am mythologizing what came before. 

So like, are things getting more stale? Are they getting less interesting? Or am I just losing it?

**EDIT: UPDATED ANNOUNCEMENT**

***Upcoming Print-on-Demand Book Price Changes ‚Äì Effective April 1, 2025***

*We always want to keep print costs as low as possible, and it has been years since we passed any price increases through to our publishing partners.*

*However, our print supplier, Lightning Source/Ingram, has announced a price adjustment starting April 1, 2025, that will be reflected on DriveThru sites.*

***Key Changes***

* _Due to increasing supply costs in the US, **Black & White print costs in the US will increase significantly**, from around 20% for low-pagecount hardcover titles up to about 50% or slightly more for large hardcover books, and with softcover titles seeing an even greater increase._
* _**UK print costs for Black & White books will also increase**, but generally only by 3-4%._
* _**Standard Color print costs will increase**, by roughly 12-13% for US printing but only around 3% for UK printing._
* _On the whole, **Premium Color print costs will decrease slightly for US printing but increase slightly for UK printing.**_
     * _Example 1: A 180-page large premium hardcover currently costs $32.10 to print in the US; after April 1, that same title will drop to $27.80._
     * _Example 2: In the UK, the same 180-page book currently costs ¬£20.23, which will increase to ¬£20.93 starting in April._

Above will most likely lead to publishers increasing prices on the books, especially those who use at-cost pricing. I ordered all hardbacks from my wish-list, just in case. :)

- - - - - - - - - 

I'm a solo player and Basic Fantasy (BFRPG) is the only D&D-like game I've played besides Worlds Without Number (WWN).

I'm running a hexcrawl. I had two sessions with a party, then had a TPK. Pretty awesome too! üòÜ

My second party is two sessions in, And I've got serious questions having sunk my teeth into the rules. 

Looking at the way advancement works, the only real difference between a Lv1 Fighter and a Lv20 Fighter is +9 to-hit bonus and a bunch of HP. 

They still theoretically have the same:

- Ability Score
- Ability Score bonus
- Armor Class
- Damage output (1d8 sword)

That feels really really strange to me. I know magic users, clerics, and thrives get more abilities, but still their stats are static except for to-hit bonus and HP. 

WWN let's you gain +1 to an Ability Score per level a max of three times at least. 

Are higher damage weapons a thing in this game, and if so, whats reasonable?

Is a lv 20 Fighter using an enchanted sword that does 5d8+10 damage or something?

My players have taken thier first contract and are going to begin the hunt next session. I read over the hunting rules for W&W again and noticed something important that's not explained:

While the basic premise for hunting is simple (assign the target a number of marks, roll each in-game day to collect marks, once all marks are acquired you find your target), what it doesn't explain is **where is the party supposed to be going while collecting these marks?** Are they just supposed to be bumbling around random hexes rolling for marks? Do they squat in one hex of thier chosing and roll for marks until they find thier target? Am I supposed to have a chosen spot for the monster to be (doesn't seem to make sense given the mark system)?

1j4s4z5,Suggest me OSR for solo play.,"I play exclusively solo. I have three ""slots"" for my games.

1. I picked Cairn for my NSR experience. My setting is dark fantasy mixed with sword and sorcery (Conan).

2. I selected various PBTA games (Ironsworn, Winsmore) for my story games. Those are low fantasy.

3. I need a game for a pure OSR experience. I want a ""classic"" fantasy setting.


Can this wonderful community help me decide on a system that would fit slot number three?

I usually play with one character and a sidekick plus hirelings. I use a physical notebook for bullet point notes or more detailed fragments. I also use a tablet for PDFs. I don't use minis, though, as I like portability. 

I wonder how it would feel to play something different from NSR or story games, and I am aiming for a ""full party"" OSR experience in solo mode. I considered Scarlet Heroes, Black Tides, and Just One Torch procedures to play with one character, but I've decided to break my rule of having a single main character to get closer to the original OSR experience. I want to play with a full party (3-4 is right number?). 

I don't like very crunchy systems, but OSRs are quite light in general. I like to have at least a pinch more ""game and structure"" than in CAIRN but I don't want to be buried under bookkeeping demands.
I also considered Shadowdark, but I would pass on this occasion, as I want to achieve a more pure OSR experience. For me, Shadowdark is more of an NSR game, because it blends with some 5e concepts, and I am already playing Cairn in NSR slot. 

I'm not sure if I want something closer to 0D&D or B/X. I think it would mainly be about exploration but not only dungeoneering. I guess I would like to explore a bit of the surface as well. Potentially playing a bit of a campaign would allow me to see how character advancement works in OSR (Cairn has Scars mechanics, but I want something more traditional).

As you probably guessed, I did not play original B/X or 0D&D back in the day, so I don't feel nostalgic about it. I am just curious, and I love the concepts in Principia Apocrypha or the OSR Primer.

QUESTIONS:

1. What game would you suggest I play?

2. Do you think playing with an analog notebook would be doable and pleasant (I love my fountain pen!), or would you suggest jumping on some kind of word processing software like OneNote or Obsidian? It is tempting to copy and paste some fragments and have notes in one tool along with my PDFs; also, tracking light, weight, and ammo is simpler than in an analog method.

3. Bonus question: Can you suggest a setting and some supplements, please? Something that enhances solo OSR play, like additional optional procedures, tools, or collections of random tables that would work with the game you suggest.

Thank you!

I don't know if this is true, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but most early D&D and OSR content focuses on the map, the story hooks, and the tools, while later systems focused a lot more on story telling. Sometimes this story telling would include mandatory short stories to understand NPC motivation, and whole blocks of prose intended to be read to the players. There is nothing wrong with that. I just find that I can present myself more confidently with less specifics.

Are there many examples of the more narrative style in OSR modules, or map and tool centered adventures for newer games?

1j4b3m4,ZINE: A Voyage to Fomalhaut,"[A Voyage to Fomalhaut](https://preview.redd.it/0w5wwpdj6xme1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c428c9f304dca51c505838c9cd71da4c496a4ea)

I am pleased to announce the publication of **A Voyage to Fomalhaut**, a 48-page setting primer, and the 100th EMDT release. This guide is suitable for both players and GMs, and presents a setting with strong sword & sorcery and sword & planet influences. The guide updates and expands on the 2008 writeup in **Fight On!** magazine #03, reflecting the one and a half decade of gaming that has taken place in the setting since that point.

*‚ÄúFomalhaut is a world whose origins coincide with the discussions that formed the modern understanding of old-school gaming in the mid-2000. Inspired by the rediscovery of Judges Guild (particularly Wilderlands of High Fantasy), the ‚ÄúAppendix N‚Äù books, and the stranger aspects of old-school play, it is a distillation of influences that make these games distinct and powerful.*

*This is a setting of bold sword & sorcery, where the Techno-Hellenic age fell in destructive interstellar wars, and was succeeded by one of iron and bronze. Here, the descendants of Man have fractured into a myriad strange societies in a changed world, some warlike, some reclusive, and some surprisingly civilised. Philosophy, religion, and cultural variety are rife with exception and local colour. But ‚Äúin every age, in every place, the deeds of men remain the same‚Äù ‚Äì and for all its strangeness, this setting, and the adventures you can find therein, should be immediately recognisable to fans of sword & sorcery adventure.*

*And where adventures are concerned, Fomalhaut can offer them in abundance: in barren wastelands dotted with the remnants of fallen empires, on wine-dark seas where splendid isles and reclusive civilisations await, in teeming cities where life is cheap and the sword can gain what even money cannot buy, deep underground in forgotten vaults and subterranean lands; and perhaps even beyond ‚Äì in strange dimensions and the domains of mirages and dreams. Men of many devices shall win it all, while those who shrink back shall be forever forgotten!‚Äù*

More detailed setting information and a preview of the deities section is found in [this post](https://beyondfomalhaut.blogspot.com/2024/12/blog-towards-fomalhaut-and-what-it-is.html).

The booklet includes the following materials:

* An introduction to the setting 4000 years after its foundation by a starfaring civilisation, and some 3200 after this civilisation‚Äôs downfall.
* A writeup of Fomalhaut‚Äôs gods and ideologies, and the practices of worship for Clerics, divine champions dedicated to a god‚Äôs cause, as well as laymen. 28 deities are discussed from Kang the Thousand-Eyed, rapacious God of Adventurers; and Mereskan the Bat-God, patron of thieves; to the Followers of the LOGOS, a sect of philosophers dedicated to the arts of mathematics and geometry; and the Idolators of Dhakam, a barbarous cult worshipping crumbling idols in the wastelands.
* A description of Fomalhaut‚Äôs regions, with its colourful mosaic of civilisations. Visit the ruined landscape of the Worn Lands, discover the mysteries of the Plateau of Ong whose cruel monks allow no stranger intruding on their domain to live, and sail seas hiding fantastic islands and fallen utopias.
* A brief guide to adventuring in the setting, with its people ‚Äì from the mammoth-hunting cavemen of the northern ice wastes to the decadent descendants of the Empire of Mung, masters of ancient technologies.
* A two-sided setting overview map, with one side drawn by Sean Stone.

**A Voyage to Fomalhaut** features cover art by Peter Mullen, and interiors by Cameron Hawkey, Graphite Prime, and various Golden Age illustrators (including some by the incomparable Virginia Frances Sterrett). The print version of the supplement is available from my [**Bigcartel store**](https://emdt.bigcartel.com/); the PDF edition will be published through DriveThruRPG with a few months‚Äô delay. As always, customers who buy the print edition will receive the PDF version free of charge.

1j35qx9,Lockpicking Failure Results in Time Tax,"I've seen a few people suggest this a way to handle percentile Thief skills, and I've also considered it. The way I imagine it working is that when a lockpicking attempt fails, rather than having the Thief be unable to even attempt that lock again until they gain a level, they simply expend a unit of time and get to try again. In an old-school format, I would expect that to be a turn (10 minutes). So, if it requires three attempts for a Thief to open a lock, then 3 turns/30 minutes/3 wandering monster checks are the most for success. 

Alternatively, it could only start taking entire turns after the first failure. So, if it takes three rolls to pass your Open Locks check, then it took 2 turns or 20 minutes. I think this latter option might be more reasonable.

I would probably add in some kind of fail state; maybe rolling 00 results in thief's tools breaking or the lock being simply impossible. Maybe different locks are of different difficulty levels and allow for a different number of attempts before being locked out of opening them.

The first consideration is whether it's a positive improvement gameplay-wise to make all locks passable. If all it takes is time to get past a lock, can that result in locks being too minimal of an obstacle? Can that encourage players to camp by a lock rather than moving through the dungeon trying all the locks they find, bottling exploration? Is the hypothetical replay value of impassable locks something worth keeping?

A second consideration is simulationism. Since you can attempt to open a lock many more times in 20 minutes than you can in 20 seconds or so, you should be rewarded for spending time on it. At the same time, though, it surely isn't the case that any lock can be opened by any lockpicker if they just spend enough time doing. Maybe there should be a limit to how many lockpicking attempts you can make; maybe 7. If you can't get it in an hour, then it's probably hopeless.

The third consideration is class balance. The old-school balance between Thieves and Magic-Users with Knock is that one is free while the other has the cost of a spell slog and the opportunity cost of not memorizing a potentially life-saving spell. With the standard rules, Knock usually knocks Thieves out of the park. With unlimited or minimally limited lockpicking attempts, Knock is only valuable in terms of saving time, as, either way, that lock is getting opened.

Maybe a fourth consideration is if the low odds of success with Thief skills encourages an old-school, creative style of play by usually requiring you to think outside your class. But that's a can of worms...

What do you think? Do you allow Thieves multiple attempts to pick locks? Do you think my solution of giving unlimited attempts with each failure after the first costing a turn is a reasonable solution? Or would you pick some other system?

1j2ytm5,Deep-Dive: Running High-Stakes Narratives & Moral Dilemmas in an OSR/OSRIC Game,"After writing my next module,¬†*N1: Desperate Dusty Desperados*, I thought it worthwhile to share some insights on running high-stakes narratives and moral dilemmas in an OSR/OSRIC framework.

There‚Äôs a persistent myth that OSR-style adventures are all about dungeon crawling and tactical combat, and that heavy roleplay or ethical decision-making don‚Äôt fit. I disagree. The best OSR/OSRIC games aren‚Äôt just about survival‚Äîthey‚Äôre about player-driven storytelling, and that includes tough moral choices.

I wanted to share some practical insights for DMs who want to introduce meaningful moral dilemmas into their OSR campaigns without railroading players or undermining the game‚Äôs core mechanics.

# 1. The Art of the No-Win Scenario

One of the best ways to raise the stakes in an adventure is to present choices without an obvious ""correct"" answer. These aren‚Äôt just about binary ‚Äúgood vs. evil‚Äù dilemmas‚Äîreal, gut-wrenching decisions arise when both sides of an issue have valid perspectives and real consequences.

For example, in¬†*Desperate Dusty Desperados*¬†has this as one of the possible encounters.

**Stoats and Spiders**: A group of¬†*lawful neutral*¬†stoats is forcing captive¬†*lawful evil*¬†rats (orcs) to process cochineal into red dye. Freeing the rats could be an act of justice or a foolish blunder as they later raid and pillage a nearby settlement. Do your players act on principle or pragmatism?

# How to Apply This in Your Games

* Make NPCs complex, not caricatures. Even villains should have motivations players can understand, even if they don‚Äôt agree.
* Don‚Äôt dictate a solution. Lay out the problem, let the players solve it.
* Tie choices to lasting consequences. Let decisions echo forward. A freed enemy might return with allies. A town might remember the party‚Äôs mercy‚Äîor see it as weakness.

# 2. Player-Led Problem Solving

A common pitfall when introducing moral dilemmas is structuring them like puzzles with a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answer. That‚Äôs antithetical to good OSR/OSRIC play. Instead, the best dilemmas are the ones that emerge naturally from the players‚Äô choices.

For example, if a desperate mining town is on the verge of collapse because bandits are cutting off supply lines, the dilemma shouldn‚Äôt be a pre-packaged ‚Äúdo you fight the bandits or not?‚Äù Instead, let the players explore the problem from multiple angles:

* Can they broker a deal between the miners and the outlaws?
* Do they raise a militia and risk turning the town into a battlefield?
* Would they try to outmaneuver the bandits, sneaking in supplies and avoiding direct conflict?
* Is there an alternative trade route that no one has considered?

The trick is to present problems, not solutions. The best moments in OSR games come from players inventing their own ways forward, rather than picking from a menu of DM-approved options.

# How to Apply This in Your Games

* Frame choices as emergent problems. Instead of ""Do you help the NPC?"" ask, ‚ÄúThis NPC is in danger. What do you do?‚Äù
* Encourage creative problem-solving. Reward ingenuity, even if the players sidestep your expected solutions.
* Let the dice decide. OSR-style games thrive on uncertainty. A noble idea might fail spectacularly. Let it happen.

# 3. The Importance of Reputation & Consequences

A great way to reinforce moral choices is through in-world consequences. If the players choose to ally with a faction, that decision should close off some doors and open others. If they betray a group, they shouldn‚Äôt just suffer a loss in ‚Äúalignment points‚Äù (who cares?)‚Äîthey should hear about wanted posters, bounties, and whispers in the dark.

* Double-Cross or Loyalty? The party is offered a high-paying job‚Äîbut what they‚Äôre not told is that accepting it puts them at odds with a powerful faction. What happens when they realize they‚Äôre working for the wrong side?
* A Reputation Earned, Not Given. The local sheriff doesn‚Äôt trust outsiders, but after witnessing the party‚Äôs actions, his attitude changes‚Äîfor better or worse.
* Enemies Hold Grudges. A bandit leader, humiliated but alive, might come back for revenge later. But if the party killed them, the remaining gang members might scatter‚Äîor swear a blood feud.

The best moral dilemmas never fully go away. They linger, shaping the world in subtle (or dramatic) ways.

# How to Apply This in Your Games

* Use NPC gossip & rumors. Let the world react to player choices in a natural way.
* Make alignment matter, but in-world. Not with mechanics, but with how people treat the party.
* Reintroduce past dilemmas later. Maybe that bandit they let go is now the leader of a growing warband.

# Final Thoughts: Moral Dilemmas & OSR/OSRIC

Running high-stakes narratives doesn‚Äôt mean you need deep backstories or scripted drama‚Äîit just means letting choices matter. In¬†*Desperate Dusty Desperados*, I built dilemmas into the setting itself rather than scripting them into a linear story. The key to making moral dilemmas shine in OSR/OSRIC-style play is to let players find the hard choices on their own‚Äîand then let them live with the consequences.

1j2ssdv,Trying to remember where I found a specific really excellent blog post on making Hex Maps,"I'll give what I remember here: 
- it was more focused on how to think about the map than pointing out actual tools to use or anything like that
- it was a series of posts spread across maybe 5-8 entries or so? My brain is saying 6 but that could just be conflating my memory with ""hex""
- gave a lot of detail on how to make realistic landscapes in a specific order - starting with the topography, determining mountains and valleys and then understanding where water would flow according to that, etc etc and eventually moving on to monster ecology and I believe faction interplay toward the end, though that could be from elsewhere. 
- the way it was developed reminded me a lot of Dungeon Masterpiece's political geography videos, but it was more physical geography, and how that influenced other aspects of physical geography for much of it. 
- old school looking blog, author was an older player from the 70s-80s I believe. Background was black 
- logo had some sort of goblinoid or troll or some kind of creature in that vein - I recall him being fat and a bit grotesque. I want to say he was green and the logo was red lettering on yellow background but it's been long enough I'm not sure that's right.

I‚Äôve been using **Adobe Acrobat Pro** to try and fix this, setting the page boxes so everything should be uniform, saving, uploading again and again but it just won‚Äôt work. I feel like I‚Äôm at a total loss here. Have been trying for last couple days watching videos, and using AI assistant everything.

I know **Kinkos/FedEx will print it**, but they‚Äôre quoting me **$89.00 for a single copy**, which is just way more than I want to spend. But it works when I upload there. Lulu's pricing is much better, and while I *could* print the 4th edition less pages version through Kinkos/FedEx for about 10 bucks, I‚Äôd really prefer to have the **3rd Edition D20 version** in print. It is so niceeeee!

If anyone has experience fixing PDFs for Lulu printing, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate any advice. I‚Äôm even open to **sending the file to someone who knows how to fix it**‚ÄîI can compensate with **some PayPal bucks** for the help! I would love to order through DrivethruRPG but we all know why we can't do that anymore...and to order the book online used is VERY expensive.

1j2951l,Colonial Village Horror Module Advice!,"Hi everyone,

I'm working on a colonial village horror module inspired by [Colonial 'living museum' villages](https://www.osv.org/), Lovecraft, and Bloodborne, for a modern OSR TTRPG.

The basic premise: A colonial village of farmers that stayed largely un-industrialized. Priest in the town discovers an old unfinished underground ritual eldritch complex built by a 1600s evil scientist and his slaves (the slaves and some witches revolted and escaped).

The priest is now trying to perform a ritual to meet an eldritch god, so he's kidnapping people in the town for sacrifice, and dumping the leftovers of their bodies into the nearby pond, causing the beavers in the pond to become fucked up evil carnivore cryptids that make their dam out of corpses.

The players are coming to the old middle-of-nowhere town because they heard about the cryptids, or missing persons, etc.

I know this is similar to Against The Cult of the Reptile God, so I'm looking to that for guidance. I will probably need a small hexmap/pointcrawl, a few dungeons (the ritual complex, the old mansion, etc.), some factions (the priest and his followers, the last witches, the townspeople?).

I want this to be fun, but I'm struggling with connecting all these ideas.

Any and all thoughts (including just ideas adding to this premise) are appreciated!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ba07f740>,osr,1740971513.0

1j1gtxt,I wrote an OSR-inspired fantasy novel,"I've just published my OSR-inspired fantasy novel, *House of the Rain King*. I think if you're into old school D&D, you'll love this book! But rather than giving you the regular pitch that I give to fantasy fans, I thought I'd talk about the OSR influences and how the book developed from an adventure module into a novel.

Way back, probably 6 or 7 years ago, I was reading James Raggi's *Better Than Any Man.* This adventure module had a lot of issues, but I fell in love with its core mechanic. In the module, the Swedish army is sweeping across the land and killing everything in its path. The army moves across the hexmap each day according to a schedule, and when they reach a town or adventure site, they destroy everything there. If the players didn't go to that site, too bad - it's gone now.

At the same time I was reading Michael Swanwick's classic sci-fi novel *Stations of the Tide*, which is about a planet suffering a once-in-a-generation high tide that will flood the entire continent.

The two ideas combined in my head as an adventure module where the PCs visit a valley that is gradually flooding. There would be a hexmap showing the growth of the river and lake each day, until finally everything is underwater. There would also be dungeons that flood from the bottom up, potentially submerging treasure but also sometimes opening new pathways.

I found a lot of dynamism in this premise. When floods come, people have to abandon lots of material possessions, so there would be plenty of opportunities for the PCs to grab stuff if they are willing to risk the rising waters. 

Around this time I also read Raggi's *The God That Crawls,* a dungeon containing a single invincible monster. This gave me the idea of a flooding dungeon inhabited by a senile rain god who wanders the halls in a stupor. He isn't very fast or aggressive, but if you get too close to him you will suffocate (too much moisture in the air). The rain god is also the reason the whole valley is flooding.

I never got to run this module, however.

Various issues led to the collapse of my online and offline gaming groups, and for a few years I didn't play D&D at all.

That was when I came up with the idea of turning the adventure module into a novel.

Long story short - all the stuff I described above is in the novel. The novel is told from the POV of the ""adventuring party"" (mercenaries who've recently arrived in the valley) as well as from several of the local people trying to survive the flood.

In writing the novel I added some elements that would appeal to traditional fantasy fans, but there is still a lot of OSR DNA in there. For instance, you will find:

* verb-noun spellcasting
* random encounters
* a dungeon crawl
* an egalitarian band of adventurers who resolve their disputes by arguing a lot
* shenanigans involving ropes and lanterns
* weird monsters
* treasure

(There is also one scene that has a specific reference to something from the AD&D Dungeon Master's Guide... I don't know if anyone will spot it though.)

If any of this has made you curious, you can buy the book from [any major ebook retailer](https://books2read.com/houseoftherainking) or get a DRM-free copy [direct from my website](https://willgreatwich.com/product/house-of-the-rain-king-digital-download/).",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ba170170>,osr,1740883678.0

1j15fmy,Light source dice rule ‚Äî torch or lantern ?,"Hello,

At my table, we've been using the light dice rule for **wolf-packs and winter snow** (might be from another RPG originally but that's the one I know it from). For those who don't know, basically a light source has its own category of dice (like damage from weapons), from a d4 for a humble candle to a d6 or d8 for a torch or lantern. Each time you get in a situation where the light might be extinguished (like getting shoved), you roll the light die and on a certain number (1-2 or 1-3 depending on your system), the light die loses a category (from d8 to d6, d6 to d4, and eventually d4 to darkness). Additionally, you roll the light die once every hour or so (might be more or less, I like the 3 turns logic personnally for a more horrific type of play).

My question to you is, which should be the higher light die, a torch or lantern ? Some at the table have argued that the torch is more likely to get extinguished by strong wind or humidity, but that the lantern is more likely to get broken by any type of shock.

I ask for thy guidance, O Great Old Ones, so you may light my way throught this insignificant conundrum.

For my own use, I don't worry about stats being perfectly logical or perfectly consistent from creature to creature. But these stats are going to be in my publicly-shared bestiary, so I want to end up with stats that most people won't question.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ba238860>,osr,1740771634.0

1j0e1wc,Improvising and riffing off of published Adventures,"I'm running an old school Adventure I won't name so what I'm about to write aren't spoilers. If you've played or run it you may recognize the scenarios. 

I run a low fantasy campaign but the party has entered Elfland or the realm of Faery so I could run over the top stuff like this. 

Takes place in a castle and the party sat down to a feast. I used almost the entire description but entirely eliminated the ""ghostly"" aspect of the scene. The players enjoyed the detailed description of each course. I use some of the side effects from consuming each dish but ditched the save versus death on two of the items as that definitely would not have been fun.

There was a boxing match scene, and I decided to make the champion a satyr instead of the written character. He strutted about like a pro wrestler. Started chasing around a dwarf jester around the room first (rodeo style) and after knocking him down the offer went to the players to challenge him.

I did the unarmed damage as written but on a roll of an 18 he would head butt with his ram horns for 1d10 damage. There was a lot of laughing as three of the players decided to challenge him.


I put all of the greenhouse scenes out in an actual Forest. 

I used to the squirrels and their acorns. Rather than being greedy, the party actually made a gesture of kindness to the squirrels in the squirrels reciprocated. 


They met the lady and the unicorn. A warlock character has a owl familiar and she has a telepathic bond with. The owl was flying overhead and so came back and gave them news to what was up The path. One of the bards decided to sing a song as they approached and they heard the unicorn gallop away but met the maiden. She gave them some information relevant to them quest.

Back in the day when we had endless hours to play we ran through all of the published modules more or less as written. 

These days I have just two to three hours per week for our in-person game to play so I just pull encounters that I think would be the most fun and change them up a little bit to fit my world better and time it out for the actual session.

1j0dwly,Seeking advice for the execution of solo/co-op OSR playing.,"My wife has expressed interest in giving ttrpgs another shot. A couple years back we played a duet session where she was the player and I was the GM, but she didn't like it at all. I think she'd be more comfortable if I played alongside her and we did it in a GM-less style.

I have quite a few solo supplements, but I seem to struggle with the actual EXECUTION of playing solo. I understand all the concepts and how they should work, but every time I attempt to play solo I just can't seem to get the ball rolling. 

For those who play this way, what is your actual process of playing? I'd like to have a higher comfort level before I play with her so that things go smoothly.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ba24e840>,osr,1740765493.0
