1jbcca3,Do you let the creator of a game influence whether or not you play/support it?,"I am an OD&D nerd and have enjoyed the recent publication from Wizards of the Coast about the original game. That sent me down a rabbit hole of retro-clones, I think they’re called. 

Al’Qadim was always my favorite 2nd Edition setting, so I was drawn to this obscure game I found called Seven Voyages of Zylarthen that is more swords and sandals than European fantasy. It reads like OD&D but, frankly, better in many respects. got some glowing reviews so I snagged it.

Yeah, it’s utterly brilliant. 

Unfortunately, I also found out in my wanderings that the creator is explicitly Islamophobic, or at least was when he was blogging many years ago. Seems like he has left the hobby. 

I want to champion a masterpiece of a game but struggle to separate art from artist, despite enjoying a game made by people as flawed and of their time as I certainly am in 2025. I also don’t want to attract the wrong kinds of people if I advertise games for it.

Has anyone run into this? Any advice? ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2af8672f0>,osr,1741981199.0
17fjy02,"Alexander Macris, the creator of Adventurer Conqueror King, is an active figure in the American alt-right movement. There are enough good B/X clones that one could buy without financially supporting the promotion of a hateful ideology.","I would have made this a reply to his kickstarter post but he has pre-emptively blocked users that were critical of him on this subreddit in order to keep the post as sycophantic as possible.

There's been an organized effort coordinated from the official Autarch discord server to jump on any comments in /r/osr that point this out, as well as to signal boost ACKS 2E prior to the kickstarter launch. The kickstarter post now on the front page was surely also shared there with the intent to generate early, non-endemic momentum. This behaviour is in violation of reddit's site-wide rules and in my opinion would warrant banning any and all Autarch/Arbiter of Worlds content from being promoted on this subreddit, a response many other subreddits have found effective against persistent brigading. This would have the added benefit of reducing the amount of transphobia and antisemitism on /r/osr, as those sentiments seem to inevitably pop up in comment chains about ACKS despite fans' insistence that the game has nothing to do with the politics of its creator.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2af991190>,osr,1698172836.0
1gy0xj3,Does the OSR community have a Nazi problem?,"I joined a local 0D&D group in my area and then left when I found out everyone at my table was a Neo-Nazi.

This was my first experience joining an OSR table so I figured I’d ask if this is common or not. Especially since there was a recent controversy with Questing Beast accepting a sponsorship from an alt-right publisher, I wonder how pervasive of an issue this is.

Edit: To clarify, they self identified as such. They weren’t just to the right of me. They didn’t just hold some racial prejudices and biases, they didn’t just support candidates I didn’t support.

1j647sw,Does anyone else feel like the scene is getting stale?,"Not a rant, nor complaining, I’m trying to spark discussion. 

Does anyone else feel like the OSR scene is getting stale? I feel like I see way fewer blog posts nowadays, and that every recent product release is either:

1) A rehash of a game (often OSE or Mork Borg)we already have with a few house rules. 

2) An art piece masquerading as a TTRPG product. Utterly unusable at the table and only hood to look at. 

Maybe I’m just out of the loop but it seems like we’re getting so much less new and creative stuff nowadays. That’s not to say that there’s nothing new and creative (Crowns 2e is cool!), just that the days of endless truly creative stuff is gone. 

Truly, I fear that we have reached the end point of commercialization in our niche hobby. It is easier and more lucrative to appeal to TTRPG book collecters rather than TTRPG player, and thus we see more and more product focused at them. 

Or matbe I’m full of doom and gloom. Perhaps I have rose tinted glasses on for the past. I was not there after all, so perhaps I am mythologizing what came before. 

So like, are things getting more stale? Are they getting less interesting? Or am I just losing it?

Edit: I perhaps mispoke when I said ""end point of commercialization"". A better term would be ""logical conclusion of commercialization"" as in, this is where it makes sense we would end up. My apologies.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2afb8b2c0>,osr,1741392205.0

1j7t0zp,Was 5e originally considered a triumph for the old school?,"I was watching the interview between Ben Milton and Mike Mearls, and at one point, Ben mentioned that when 5e first launched, the OSR community initially saw it as a victory for their style of play—but over time, that perception soured.  

I wasn’t around the OSR at the time—I only discovered it after 2020—but that idea resonates with me. Even before I became disillusioned with 5e and moved toward OSR games, I remember 5e in 2014 feeling much closer to the experience I wanted. It wasn’t so much the original system that pushed me away, but how both the system and its community evolved over time. A Knight at the Opera [wrote a post that](https://knightattheopera.blogspot.com/2024/10/in-mouth-of-madness.html) really captured my feelings on this shift. Even now, I feel like I'd be happy to run a campaign using *Into the Unknown,* or even 2014 PHB-only with some hacks.  

So, for those who were active in the OSR back in 2014: Does Ben’s description of the community’s reaction sound accurate? If so, did the OSR community ultimately reject 5e because their initial reaction was inaccurate in ways that become more clear over time; or did the game start in a place that mostly aligned with OSR sensibilities before drifting away? Was it just a matter of ""that the gods it's not 4e""?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2afc7b710>,osr,1741590911.0
1i4wq5y,Running 5e showed me how much I love OSR principles,"I ran D&D5e for the first time in about 4 years last night, at a one-shot event for strangers hosted at a local cafe, and it was the most unwieldy, inelegant and unsatisfying GMing experience I’ve had in years.

I put a party of 4 Level 1 PCs through ‘Barrow of the Bone Blaggards’ by Necrotic Gnome because I know it pretty much off by heart. 5e’s lack of exploration procedures and dungeon turns, as well as how distinctly special and overpowered even a Level 1 party is, was infuriating. Darkvision, cantrips, and many class features just make it a complicated and poor situation.

However, by far the worst offender was the Skill system. I had to shut down players calling for their own skill checks: “You step carefully into the murky chamber-“ “Perception - 11, damn!” “Please, just let me finish and roll when I ask you to.” The players constantly insisted on contextualising everything from the myriad numbers on their sheets as opposed to making in-universe decisions.

The players had a good time, and I didn’t show my frustrations, but it was so disappointing that they couldn’t get the full experience due to the leeway given by a bloated and weak system.

I’ve never felt more vindicated that the OSR/NSR/rules-light space is the place for me. I’ll be sticking with my staples of Cairn, OSE, Vaults of Vaarn, X-Borgs, Into the Odd, and Mothership from now on!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2afcde660>,osr,1737287114.0

1fk2xgd,What are your top 3 OSR games? (2024 update),"Two years ago there was a post here on the OSR subreddit with the exact same title as this one (sans parentheses).  Lots of people submitted three choices, which were compiled in a Google Doc.  The results, when ordered and ranked based on how often they were picked, gave a really interesting insight into the play culture here (you can find them linked at the bottom).

Well it's been (almost exactly) two years since that previous post.  Two years of an OGL scandal, a deluge of great new games, and the slow ever moving treads of play culture zeitgeist.  I would love to see what has changed since September 2022 and was hoping for responses to help recreate this poll:

**Can you denote your top three OSR TTRPGs?  They can be your ""Top""/""Favorite""/""Best"" (etc.) games for any reason.  Order doesn't matter, as each of your three submissions will be counted once.**

* Basic Fantasy
* Vaults of Vaarn
* Shadowdark

1jezkmd,My players won't stop collecting teeth,"In our Mausritter campaign, I'd created a wizard's tower inhabited by a necromancer obsessed with teeth. He went by The Dentomancer. The Dentomancer made an offhand comment about bring willing to buy teeth off of them, and wasn't really interested in anything besides teeth. It was a hook for a sidequest, nothing more really. 

** I was a fool. **

What I thought was just a fun detail became a goal for one of my players. In his mind, teeth = gold = xp. Teeth have become a complex mechanic with numerous details and caveats. Each time he kills a creature he wants to know the monetary value of their teeth, spends time taking the teeth out of corpses, and asking if any creatures have unique teeth. 

This idea had spread to the rest of my players. They will often choose to engage in combat based solely off of tooth quantity and quality. I've had to Google the number of teeth for real life creatures pretty consistently, and there are now special teeth encumbrance rules. Each new type of tooth results in a new ruling. I'm a big believer in ""rulings not rules"" but they are pushing that philosophy to its limit. It has been six months of consistently tooth-based gameplay. 

The thing is the players have yet to return to the Dentomancer to cash in their teeth. I don't know what will happen when they do. It's not really that big a deal but I wish I had a real solution for this. What should I do?



TL;DR: My Mausritter players have become obsessed with collecting teeth for money, to the point it has become a significant mechanic. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b08e9eb0>,osr,1742397906.0
184peia,PSA: LotFP has sexual violence built into the core rules,"Lamentations of the Flame Princess has >!rape, genital mutilation!< and sexual violence built into the core rules/mechanics, in the random tables in the ""Summon"" spell. Following Rules as Written, you may be ""forced"" (or at least asked) to roleplay through these acts of sexual violence.

Why post this PSA? I believe, due to the nature of sexual violence and its affect on people and society, that anything containing sexual violence should be clearly labeled as such. Especially with RPG's, where you might be asked to role-play through sexual violence, I believe that it needs to be explicitly cleared with everyone involved.

I regularly see people recommending LotFP along side Basic Fantyasy RPG, OSE, Swords & Wizardry, etc, without making it clear that LotFP has these components of sexual violence built into its core rules, and the others do not. I think a lot of people must not be aware of this, and so I'm posting this so people are aware and can make their own decisions fully informed. Again, this is not just part of the setting of LotFP, it is part of the Core Rules.

For me, it's important that I can hand a player or potential player the ""Core Rulebook"" or ""Players Handbook"" and NOT have them exposed to descriptions of >!rape or genital mutilation!<. I have friends that have been >!raped, and some that have been molested as children!<, and these kinds of descriptions and reminders are traumatizing to them. So it's important to me that they are clearly labeled.

LotFP states ""18+ Explicit Content"", but I'm guessing most people (including me), expect it to mean more ""sexual content and innuendo"" and less ""sexual violence"". I wish Raggi was more clear about what is meant by ""18+ Explicit Content"".

Just to be clear, in order to trigger these mechanics you need to have a character cast the spell ""Summon"", fail a check or two, and then roll just right on the random tables for the spell. There is a good chance most people playing LotFP have never seen these mechanics in action. Also, as a side note, the ""Summon"" spell encourages human sacrifice, in that it will provide a bonus to the caster for some of the random rolls.

The section in question is in the free ""LotFP Weird Fantasy Role-Playing - Player Core Book:Rules & Magic"" (file name LotFPRulesMagicFreeNoArt.pdf)? Here is a quote from that pdf, from under the Summon spell in the Spell Descriptions (pages 134-143, the exact quote coming from pages 141-142 in the subsection 6:""Lust of a Betrayed Lover""):

""All characters within the local area (to be deter- mined by the situation) roll 1d6. Those that roll a 1 are at fault for the situation. All characters not at fault will become allies in the drive to hunt down, subdue, >!and mutilate the genitals !<of all who are at fault. After this is done, all who are not at fault must make a saving throw versus Magic. Those who fail will seek to kill the parties at fault, and all who stand in their way of doing so. The effect ends only when all of the characters at fault have been dealt with, although they will not be hostile with any of the characters present who are not at fault , even if they were hostile or longtime enemies before Summon was cast. If nobody is at fault, then things will get ugly. All characters become obsessed and fixated on one random other character in the vicinity, and >!will attempt to have sex with that character!<—at any cost. The character will first attempt to subdue the subject of his obsession, to unconscious if he can or death if he must, before>! having his way!<. Male- female pairings will result in conception, and 10% of male-male pairings will as well. The offspring will be an otherworldly creature—use these Summon charts to determine exactly what, assuming a 1 HD creature—which will do>! 1d10 damage to a woman carrying it as it is born, 2d10 to a man!<. The effect ends for a character when >!his lust is sated!<.""

It currently is linked from [lotfp.com](https://lotfp.com) and is on DriveThruRPG

Edit: I kind of feel like those who are saying ""It's LotFP and Raggi - It should be obvious what it's going to contain"" are being purposefully obtuse. I wouldn't be surprised if LotFP is in the top 20 OSR games recommended by people on this site - but it's the ONLY game commonly recommended that contains any sexual violence in the core rules. Hence this PSA post.

Edit 2: I really dislike moralizing regarding violence in games, because I feel it leads to silly and pointless quagmires. That said, there are real world scenarios where violence can have a  pragmatic purpose. For instance, defending ones family from a murderer, or defending your country from a conquering force. But there is never a scenario where sexual violence is pragmatic - it is always sadistic, meant to tear down, subvert, violate and destroy. That is why it's treated differently.

Edit 3: This post got way more attention than I expected. I want to make it clear, I am opposed to censorship and support Freedom of Speech. This wasn't a ""call to action"", but if I was going to make a suggestion or request, it would be that when you recommend LotFP, include a warning that it contains sexual violence. You can link to this post if you want.

Anyway, I'm done here for now. This post is way too long. I'm going to spend my time on things more enjoyable, like looking at the newest settings and OSE adaptations!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b0a1df40>,osr,1701044211.0

1ih3zx6,"One of my players (magic-user) has subtly complained about not being able to do anything and feeling useless, how should I address this?","So, first off, he's playing a Magician in a Dolmenwood campaign, he just hit level 4. I keep telling him there will eventually be a payoff, but we've gone through 1 large dungeon and 3 small ones at this point. Dude is a great friend of mine since childhood, there is absolutely no interpersonal conflict between us. This is not a ""talk to your player"" problem.

Here's some things I've heard him say or mention recently:

""I'm a magic-user, so I can't do anything this round.""

""I would use a spell here, but I don't know any, and we should save it for Sleep anyway.""

""I'm not even going to throw a rock because I have like a -4 to hit.""

""Being a magic-user is objectively worse than being a wizard in modern systems. There's no cantrips, but it's still somewhat satisfying to sleep a horde of enemies. It just rarely happens.""

And so on. I should mention, he does like the OSR playstyle, completely gets it, and he knows he has to think creatively. But I think he sometimes just wants to blast monsters, ya know? And sitting there watching the fighter run up and 1v1 tough foes while the cleric incinerates a horde of skeletons with turn undead... Yeah, I can kinda see why.

And to address some of his problems, he *has* found plenty of spells to learn, but most are situational, and he's always under the assumption Sleep is better so he's afraid to use up any slots. 

He is a Breggle, and can use his horns to attack which are better than any weapon he can use, but he is playing it smart and safe and does not get into any melee combat.

Basically I am looking for suggestions on how to handle this perceived imbalance (I am aware this is the nature of being a MU). But at the same time, I just want him to have more fun. 

Should I let him learn a cantrip? Give him magic rod which can cast a cantrip? How would I even go about designing a basic cantrip? Save vs. Spells or take 1d4 damage? 

And for what it's worth, I have allowed him to change classes, but he wants to commit to MU. I think he's trying to power through it.

1fl3n6n,The new rule on AI content is not clear at all,"As the title says, this is a half-baked rule that was frankly not thought through in its current form.

For example, Heroes of Adventure is a system that was getting some notice on here a while back. That system's art is (I believe entirely) AI-generated. Is all discussion of Heroes of Adventure now banned on here? If a link to Heroes of Adventure content is posted on here and it shows some of the art, will that get the poster banned? Is discussion of Heroes of Adventure's aesthetic banned? Only if someone links to some of the art as an example? Unclear.

What about products that use some AI art here and there, but are mostly not AI-generated? Allowed for discussion? Linking? Does it make a difference whether or not the cover art is AI?

If an online sandbox generator uses some kind of machine learning, is that banned? Are we banned from linking to it? From posting results it generates?

I'm not particularly attached to AI art, and I certainly don't want the sub to get clogged with AI spam. Some of my favorite creators absolutely despise it (e.g. David McGrogan).

But I don't think my preferences should control what other people are allowed to post, and I don't understand why the mods skipped over the intermediate position of simply requiring all AI content to be clearly tagged so that those who want to downvote can do so.

These are the kinds of problems you run into when you rush out a rule in a fit of indignation with no meaningful discussion, while most of your community is asleep. I don't care to see AI-generated art.

1gngool,Starting to rethink this whole OSR thing...,"Curious if anyone can relate.

So, I started out playing and then DMing 5e, as a lot of people do. I grew dissatisfied with 5e, so I looked around for alternatives. I discovered the OSR and dove into it, reading the blogs, watching the videos, and buying the games. I started up a Keep on the Borderlands Moldvay Basic game, though it's fizzled due to out of game reasons. I'm looking to start something up again, but I'm having second thoughts.

The games I tried to run with 5e are very different from the game I tried to run and the games I've considered running with B/X. I've been in the OSR sphere, so I've definitely absorbed a lot of old school sensibilities, but I'm starting to wonder if the OSR* is specifically right for me and my players. 

My players haven't shown a huge amount of interest in the ""dungeon crawl"" scene; especially since it's not really part of 5e or popular culture in general. I don't think they are into the idea of ""survival horror"" and going through many characters. I also think I might actually want something where characters can have more longevity and be involved in longterm storytelling. I know plenty of people have had incredible long term stories emerge from this style of play, but it seems like the high lethality would make this less common. I don't really think you can do something like Lord of the Rings with something like B/X. It wouldn't be the same if you had four consecutive fellowships, lol.

I'm not criticizing these games or the people who like them. I'm just rethinking whether it's right for me. I got sucked into the 5e scene, and then I got sucked into the OSR scene, so this is probably a me problem. 

I think I might want to features larger worlds than dungeons with more going on, with political machinations, travel, etc. (I'm not saying that cant be done with these games, but B/X and its derivations seem very specifically designed for the dungeon).

I guess I'm wondering what recommendations the community has. Would 2e give the things I originally sought from the OSR (higher danger level, role-playing rather than rollplaying, character discovery rather than character building, etc)? Is there some other OSR game that you'd recommend for the complete D&D experience, both below and aboveground?

I'm also wondering if there are any former 5e-ers that can relate to my experience here, as I'm sure I'm not that unique. 

Heck, I'm even wondering if 5e might be worth revisiting with OSR principles and features. There are a number of OSR things I know would have really improved 5e when I ran it (random encounters, reaction rolls, roleplay resolution instead of rolling, etc). But I'd probably end up stripping so much it wouldn't really be 5e anymore.

But yeah, I appreciate any comments and suggestions. 

EDIT: Maybe I didn't word my thoughts correctly. I don't want no dungeon crawling or lethality, but dungeon crawling plus other elements well-supported. Lethality-wise, I can't firmly say yet.

I appreciate it adds realism, it’s not necessarily that hard to track and it’s part of the OSR history / tradition. Maybe that’s reason enough and getting rid of it would lead to a worse experience. Still, have you tried playing without it? Was the game worse? 

Does it actually affect player behaviour? Do your players ever say, “Right, we better stop exploring the dungeon now and head back to town to buy more torch bundles”? Given how cheap and light (pun intended) they are in most systems, isn’t it trivial to keep a very large supply in the first place? 

And what happens if players run out of light? Is it effectively a TPK, with the party stumbling around in pitch darkness, getting picked off by monsters with infravision? Or do the demi-humans just conga line lead everyone out?

1jcnc7i,In defense of Keep on The Borderlands (and also a defense of Humanoid enemies),"I came across a thread a few weeks ago and I’ve been ruminating on my thoughts for a while. The thread is locked so I couldn’t reply right then and there and I’m not sure where I even saw it or who this response is to but oh well, here I am.

 The main gist was “why run keep on the borderlands? It’s boring, none of the enemies are interesting and they don’t even name any of the NPC’s.” Other people replied but no answer was sufficient (in my or the OP’s opinion.) 
I believe that KOTB is the perfect module to get someone to DM. That was the main purpose in the first place. The area is quite large with a lot of interesting little areas and room for the DM to flex their creativity. It leaves quite a bit open to slot into any campaign.

Aside from the faction play that really makes the caves of chaos so fun, having humanoids be the first real enemies allows both the players and the DM to understand the motives, tactics and mindset of what you are fighting. Big pig face dude and sneaky little boys are much easier for someone new to both TTRPGs and fantasy as a whole to understand than say, a gibbering mouther or xorn. 

We’ve had decades upon decades of iterations on ttrpgs, lots of new creations and creativity on the scene and we are in an absolute deluge of new options. Why complain about the origins of the hobby?That’s where most of this started for a metric butt ton of people. Of course it’s tropey. It created the tropes! 

I guess I’m going to end this with a question. Other than time constraints, why does it seem like there are a lot of people who don’t understand that this is a game of imagination? Why are some people seemingly allergic to deviating from the books and making it their own? (And just to add some inflammatory statements, this question also goes for the Hispanic coded Orcs in the 5e art. If you don’t like it, don’t add it. You aren’t beholden to the creator’s vision because once the book is yours, it’s your book. You’re the creator now.)

1h21gf7,Ancient Mesopotamia in OSR,"So, I’m a NELC (Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations) student, and for a final project in one class the professor floated the idea of making an RPG module based on Ancient Mesopotamia. I’ve been contemplating the idea of fleshing out the project into a full module and setting book for an OSR-rules game, as I’ve been playtesting my project document with friends and having a ball, and thought it would be fun to get some feedback from the OSR community.

Are any of you interested in the idea of an OSR game based in third millennium Ancient Mesopotamia?

As a player, what would you want to see in a campaign like this? Is there anything you know about the setting—or want to learn more about—that you think you’d enjoy seeing in a campaign?

What sort of information would you want as a GM to bring Ancient Mesopotamia to life?

—

My own research focus is on deities and mythology so those feature prominently in the campaign. Yesterday I ran an adventure loosely based on Gilgameš’s encounter with the legendary forest guardian Humbaba, and the players ended up spending six hours exploring Humbaba’s curse-protected forest and collecting items to help them with their final confrontation with him.

I’m also a really big fan of linguistics and can’t help myself but to include a lot of Sumerian in my project. One feature my friends/players seemed to really enjoy is the ability to construct their own ancient Sumerian names - most of these names are theophoric (e.g., people are named after a deity, usually in a short sentence like “Enki provides”) so I was able to give players a list of name formulas with translations to plug a god’s name into and make a wholly unique name for their character. Outside of naming schemes, it’s actually kind of neat from an academic perspective how fast they picked up Sumerian words and phrases! I think the language additions add a lot of flavor to the campaign. 😊

As a DM and as a player, I really love the OSR philosophy of encouraging lateral thinking and rewarding creative problem-solving. Historical settings are fun to explore with that mindset, as many mythological beings can be quite dangerous but don’t necessarily have malevolent intentions. OSR in general feels like the perfect rules system to explore a setting like this. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b23e88c0>,osr,1732815923.0
1gysfhs,"""Preserving The Past"" or Smash Your Idols?","I saw someone make a comment about how the OSR is about ""preserving the past"" and I'm not sure I agree with that.

For me, it's a lot more about correcting the errors of the past, whether that's the harlots and strumpets table or descending armour class.  It's about clearing up the gaps and the loopholes, the horrendous formatting and outright bad rules.  It's about making something that might have been missed first time around available to everyone.

The past is dead and gone; it's more important to take it's lessons forward than to grieve for it.  When I see a golden idol, I pry the rubies from it's eyes.

Every OSR table uses slightly different rules, hell the same table might use different rules in different games.  The hackability and drive to keep things as light as possible are a core part of the OSR for me, rather than re-simulation of a game even it's authors kept revising.

1dpmt2m,Having a harder time enjoying 5e since getting into the OSR,"I've gotten the supplies to run an OSR game (B/X), and the more I learn about OSR playstyle, the harder it is for me to enjoy 5e.

Something that is really frustrating now that I know it's not necessary is how everything in 5e is gated behind mechanics. You can come up with a great plan to infiltrate a party with a disguise, but if you roll low, then too bad.

(I know that does come to a large degree from DM playstyle, but it is pretty consistently how 5e DMs do it across the board)

It really feels like it limits your creativity. I want to do this cool thing, but my character didn't specialize for it so I guess I'll just only do *my thing*. 

It's harder to enjoy roleplay when much of social interaction gets limited by rolls and mechanics. The other day, a DM told us all to roll Insight or Perception, then outright told us the person we were speaking to was suspicious.

Gee. There was no other way to convey that.

5e combat, too, feels painfully long and drawn out.

In these types of discussion, it is always brought up that Super DM can run it totally different and way better in 5e. Perhaps, but the vast majority of 5e DMs still do these things.

Can anyone else relate? It's harder to enjoy 5e now, but 5e is still the only game people I know play. And I honestly don't feel like playing online with guys in their 50s, sorry.

EDIT: upset a lot of people with my comment about guys in their 50s.

1irszg3,I really don't understand why Glumdark is on top of the Kickstarter charts right now. In defense of system-specific and offense of system-agnostic random tables.,">A massive, fully illustrated, painstakingly constructed resource for Game Masters and players of dark fantasy tabletop roleplaying games. Recommended for the likes of Mörk Borg but totally system agnostic and compatible with Shadowdark, Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, or any other TTRPG.

It claims to be system agnostic, which is theoretically true, however the reason why people play Shadowdark over Mörk Borg or Pathfinder over D&D is because these **systems are tools to tell particular type of fiction.**

For example, D&D 5e is largely a game about heroic roleplay where characters brave social, exploration and combat encounters with their bespoke talents. Therefore DMs will tend to run encounters that engage with the PCs character systems. Therefore to maximize fun in those systems, the GM needs to engage with those rules, or else the players end up with a whole bunch of buttons that do nothing.

And 5e, unbeknownst to most of you, I'm sure, has bespoke random tables!

|1d20|Situation|
|:-|:-|
|1|A dragon wyrmling has gathered a band of kobolds to help it amass a hoard.|
|2|Wererats living in a city's sewers plot to take control of the governing council.|
|3|Bandit activity signals efforts to revive an evil cult long ago driven from the region.|

A small snip of the DMG (please don't Pinkerton me, WotC). As you can see Adventure Starters in 5E do a couple things. They set up a situation where players solve a problem through any combination of social, combat encounters and a place to explore. This isn't random design, the table is written that way because of the way 5e, as a game, works. It also references settings and monsters, because those monsters aren't just statblocks, they mean things. Dragons and Kobolds have very distinct roles in the meta-setting of modern D&D.

The players are playing to achieve and overcome conflict.  
  
Mörk Borg is a rules light game driven largely by its setting, which is interlinked with its mechanics to create tone and atmosphere. Mörk Borg mechanics, despite being relatively rules-light, is inextricably linked with its setting. If you ignore The Calendar of Nechrubel, most of the other game elements fall flat. If the world doesn't end, what's the point of the Basilisks under Galgenbeck? If nobody believes the prophecies, then why is the world such a dark place? If characters aren't meant to be fairly disposable, then why do they die so quickly?

https://preview.redd.it/bgj2mfiyzqje1.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=06d4457949df9733bbf6a68216211a13dda82ef9

As you can see, the contents of the table are definitely not system or setting agnostic and build upon the Mörk Borg setting. They also don't seed for encounters, like most OSR games, it is leaving space for emergent storytelling. The players are playing to find out.

You see, while these tables are random, the content is still bespoke for the game and build upon its mechanics and tone.

But here is a Glumdark Table for Quest Seeds example:

1 You meet a hedge wizard who is the victim of a terrible curse. They want you to do some exploring for them. Head to the Covered Waterfall and see if you can find a rumored cache of goods.  
2 Guard the warden Oto Potocnik on their journey to the Blasted Ocean.  
3 The cleric Teja Pohl needs you to seize the Quill of Rats from the Roost of Contemplation.

1. You meet magical dude with nondescript condition. They want you to go dungeon crawl at nondescript place. The dungeon crawl has nondescript loot maybe.  
2. Escort a dude with interesting yet nondescript job title to evocatively named yet nondescript place.  
3. Dude with interesting job needs you to dungeon crawl to find evocatively named thing.

Like I am not crazy right, but running these in either 5E or MB seems very attractive. Evocatively named things have to be made up retroactively to fit the setting or content has to be added through GM fiat.

What difference does it make if I go to the Blasted Ocean over the Covered Waterfall? Neither these places are real or even loosely defined. There is no restriction, which could breed creativity.

Like random tables are fun tools because you point you into a direction, but rather Glumdark is just spits out a sequence of words you have to assign directions to.

https://preview.redd.it/zjoxbgqz5rje1.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba38a19343ef1e5f47b3555e42b42472bac75345

Like what do I do with this? Hello Player, you receive a grim bullwhip of throat-punching? What does it do? How does it relate to the world the rules have laid out? What makes it weird? How does that weirdness manifest mechanically?

At that point I am not consulting a random table, but just creating homebrew with a random dark sounding title, which doesn't make the DM's job any easier.

So honestly while it does seem nice that Glumdark is system-agnostic, I can't help but feel that they might have shot themselves in the foot by being too general and just end up with a ""grim fantasy wacky words"" table, rather than a helpful and opinionated tool for DMs.

It seems like a lot of modules basically encourage players being good and heroic do-gooders in a society where adventuring is generally socially accepted the same way going to college is considered a ""good thing"".

However in old school games, the adventurers tend to start out as extremely weak peasants looking for glory, despite just one pit trap away from certain death. Usually those dungeons aren't cleared to save the world, but just because treasures wait inside. So unless the PCs are exceptionally greedy and thrill-seeking or desperate for money, this would be extremely irresponsible behavior with poor RoI in any medieval agricultural society.

I would therefore argue that in Old School games, the PCs start out as ""low-life"" characters and glory seekers, which is in stark contrast to how the PCs are socially perceived in Modern D&D.

1d5uzix,Knave 2e disappointment? Other opinions?,"Just got Knave 2e physical book in the mail. The hardcover quality is good and the artwork by Peter Mullen is awesome!

I'm quite disappointed with the rules and content though . . . it seems so, I don't know, half-finished? Not play tested? It's hard to say but it seems like the content was just kind of mashed together without much thought.

A lot of the random tables seem like they were glued in to pad the page count  without any real context or explanation of how/when to use them. I know it's subjective but the entries aren't particularly inspiring to me either. I understand that it's  a matter of taste but it seems like ChatGPT could give me a similar list of 100 different types of fabric, etc . . . nothing is particularly novel or creative.

Some of the rules seem pretty half-baked, too. The number of encounter rolls per day using the hazard dice and the ration depletion seems off. The relic magic was very disappointing: basically just telling me as the GM to make something up by myself.

I loved the first version of Knave: so much value and play was crammed in 7 pages! I played the hell out of it! Just wondering what others' thoughts on Knave 2e are. I wanted to love this game . . . it was going to be my go to system but now I'm regretting the money I spent. Maybe I'm missing something?

Curious what others are thinking of Knave 2e . . .

EDIT:

I want to thank everyone for sharing their opinions! I think I came into the Kickstarter with the wrong expectations. The book and art are beautiful and I'm glad that many folks are having a great time with it at their table. I'll admit to not having played it yet and will give it a test drive in a dungeon. Good gaming all!

  
UPDATE (2 months later):

I took the advice of some of the folks in this thread and gave Knave 2e a solo spin in some dungeons. I used the new OSE Anthologies to play ""The Jeweler's Sanctum"" and ""Curse of the Maggot God"" using the Knave 2e rules. I had an alright time of it. Thanks to those who suggested I get more information and real experience with the rules. 

Knave 2e will not be my 'go to' system but I wanted to share my hopefully more balanced and informed experience below to be fair. Thanks again to all who commented to agree or disagree. 

  
POSITIVES IMO

+ Character creation: 

(a) I found a few tables that helped me create some interesting looking Knaves that were interesting and fun. But I had to go to the NPC section for this . . . 

+ Rules: 

(a) The rules translated well to the OSE dungeons and stats. It was quick and easy to resolve encounters. 

(b) The rules didn't require much in the way of conversion. I just used the AC stats in the module as written. Same as Knave 1e this was good. 

+ Encounters: 

(a) I used the overloaded dice and it was okay in the dungeon crawl. I had to ignore a couple of rolls for consecutive burnt torches. It wasn't that bad. The dungeons had their own 'shift' tables built into the random encounter tables so I used those for dungeon shifts. 

NEGATIVES IMO

- Character creation: 

(a) I didn't really prefer the 'careers' and their items. I traded most out for other stuff and it seemed weird rolling two often very disconnected backgrounds. 

(b) Still really not a fan of Relic magic. I love the idea but I didn't find the tables helpful enough in creating relics and Gods. The results were strange and hard to bind together into something workable and fun.

(c) Traveling to the NPC section for character details was a hassle. But that was my choice to spice up the characters to make cartoon sketches so not Knave 2e's problem.

- Encounters: 

(a) I tried using the random tables for dungeon shifts and they were really weird results that I would have struggled to use in the module as written. Thankfully these particular modules had 'shifts' that were written in so I used those instead.

11l514k,OSR theory vs reality,"My background: Started playing D&D in 1979 with the Holmes blue box. Played regularly ever since. Witnessed the genesis and growth of the old-school renaissance movement on various forums since it started more than 15 years ago, and participated in many discussions about what made early D&D different from what came later.

And I’m here to tell you that dogma like ‘combat is a fail state in old-school D&D’ is revisionist nonsense. And the fact it gets bandied around so often is proof that the reality of how people played D&D 40 years ago has been eclipsed by theory-craft.

By the time AD&D was published, the great majority of gamers employed a mix of published and home-brew adventures. Adventures like Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, White Plume Mountain, Keep on the Borderlands, and Village of Hommlet flew off the shelves. None of these are mega-dungeons. None of them present a premise of sneaking into a dungeon and liberating it of treasure without alerting the inhabitants. In some cases, putting the inhabitants to the sword to remove a threat to civilization is the whole point of the adventure (G1, the Caves of Chaos). In others (White Plume, Hommlet, the Tower of Zenopus), the scope and layout of the dungeon does not enable the stealthy circumvention of threats.

No, when the party rolled up to the entrance of those dungeons, they were on a search a destroy missions to kill the monsters and take their stuff. Did they use deception and cunning tricks to shift the odds in their favour? Absolutely. Did they retreat from combat when they realized they were in over the heads? For sure. Did many PCs die out of bad play or bad luck? Yep.

But what they did not do is treat combat as a fail state. Rolling dice and killing monsters was the heart of the game, and the default premise of these hugely popular adventures - adventures that taught new players what D&D was about. How Gygax and a few other OGs played in 1975 was already irrelevant to the player-base by 1979. How would we have even known how Castle Greyhawk was run?

It’s cool that the OSR revived old and forgotten play modes and principles. I was part of that early dialogue, when we shared stories of desperate struggles to survive the Caverns of Thracia, or the six-level meatgrinder of a dungeon that our DM in grade 10 made over summer break. And how those experiences contrasted with the heroic, super-powered assumptions of 3.X D&D.

But the message has become garbled and distorted on forums like this, often by people who didn’t play 30+ years ago. Now they’re preaching and enforcing an orthodoxy that would have been absolutely baffling to a bunch of 15 year olds chucking dice in a rec room in the 80s.

Tldr: The OSR principles that get bandied on forums like this are not reflective of how the great majority of people played D&D in the first decade of its publication. They were crafted and championed with the aim of reviving a very narrow approach to play that was - until recently - not widely adopted or even known about.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b2b234d0>,osr,1678209088.0

The particular argument I saw was based on reading the ""zen moments"" of the primer as a reaction to D&D3e rather than as a set of novel statements; that ""Rulings not Rules"" means a DM should be able to use rules for intuitive results rather than that detailed rules are to be avoided, and that ""forget game balance"" means players should sometimes be faced with challenges which must be worked around or avoided rather than the idea of a ""balanced encounter"" itself being anathema to the game.

What are other sayings of the OSR community that you've seen people struggle with, or aphorisms which could be confusing if you don't understand the context?

1ife00w,Nostalgia is such a trap,"I bought the $5 pdf of the Village of Hommlet. I wish I hadn't, but I wouldn't have known that if I didn't buy it. I'm reading through it - or rather trying - because it's just so dense. It will in all seriousness require more notes than many college papers I've written. And, that isn't what bothers me. Gygax's prose has its charms and in the late seventies and early eighties I had a lot more time (being an adolescent with no responsibilities will do that for you). It's a product of the era after all.

No. What bothers me is that ANY modern adventure writing would follow that or even Keep on the Borderlands as a template. And, I say that with all love for Keep. Keep I've had for years and I have an almost intuitive index of its contents in my head at this point. But, I wanted to supplement that with the (in)famous Hommlet. **So, if anyone has a ""starting location"" sort of option that is written for actual use and play and not for Summer reading lists, or wants to share their own notes on Hommlet, I'm all ears.** I honestly don't know what I was expecting. I own G123 and D123. I know what Gygax's work typically looks and reads like. Nostalgia colored glasses get me again.

I'm reminded of why as a young DM I developed the ability to wing and improv as early as I did. It's because I wanted to run games not do homework. Anyway, end rant.

Edit: I appreciate most of you. I'll revisit it when I'm prepared to read Gygax rather than read a gameable product. It's really a testament to the quality of the phenomenon that was D&D that it survived the writing and edits of the day. Some of you though... have even more rose colored glasses than I have.

EDIT EDIT: Thanks for the support, folks. And the offers of notes, too! I'm going to complete this and I'll share my own notes; could be fun to compare notes and what different DMs took from the village! Hell, the process is part of the fun; it just isn't the fun I was expecting for some reason. I know it sounds like I'm talking smack about Gary, but I'm really not. His love of language was a HUGE influence on me and one of the things that kept me a voracious reader as a teenager. And, it's clear when you read anything he touched.

113nmdm,Dear Mods and OSR Redditors,"Dear Mods and OSR Redditors 

I like this subreddit because it is the closest thing to the old G+ forum. 

On G+ people micro-blogged, people posted discussion topics, and people shared links to their blogs and crowd funding projects. 

All these activities were valued. 

In particular, sharing a blog post showed people something they may or may not have known about and/or liked. If the blog post was not your bag, you simply scrolled past. I never considered sharing a blog post to be “spamming”. That presupposes that the posters are selling that which the users do not want to see. I want to see these blog posts highlighted, to see new things. 

I like to see blog posts effectively rated by up/down votes, it throws light on interesting blog post that I might not have taken an interest in. 

I know there is a subset of redditors that hate blog posts, and only want to have discussions. But, **why are they the most important users on this subreddit?**  

Recently, there seems to be a trend on this subreddit to make this subreddit like all the boring subreddits where the mods are uber-controlling, to make this subreddit like all the other uptight subreddits. 

I don’t think blog post links should be ghettoed to a single thread (and we all know ghettoed threads are where things are sent to die), because some subredditors don’t like those kinds of post. It’s not like I have noticed an abusive amount of blog post. 

Please leave this subreddit as it has been for the last 8 or so years, there was nothing wrong with the permissive, embracive culture. Why mess with the winning formula? 

I guess I’m bringing this seeming change in policy to the fore, and the “we only like discussions posts” brigade will downvote this post hard.

1evkr02,Discovering OSR ruined other RPG playstyles for me,"I have a background of about 7 years DMing 5e, but also World of Darkness games, Powered by the Apocalypse-like games etc. As a GM, I've basically struggled from the start, and often my struggles relate to adventure design, specifically making an interesting plot and designing a line through the adventure while leaving enough space and tools to play with to allow for player freedom. My plots never felt interesting, getting players to follow them was a pain (""my character is not interested in that"") and getting ""off the rails"" has always been scary for me, not because I'm afraid of improvising, but because once there's rails, that becomes constraining for that improvisation. And the fear of characters dying, both from players because they are very attached, and from me as it can derail the adventure. 

Discovering the OSR, it just feels more right. No grand plot but an interesting world to explore, from which a story evolves. Players being challenged themselves to be genuinely creative and resourceful and death isn't a nuisance that threatens the end the campaign, it's part of the design. A more player-driven outlook, so no more needing to convince players or characters to go on an adventure.  Admittedly these aspects might not be exclusive to OSR but the point stands. 

Knowing that this way of playing exists, makes it even more draining to prep for other games, and playing in such games can be frustrating. Knowing death isn't really on the table because nobody wants the campaign to end, just suddenly makes everything feel pointless? I don't want to meta game but when the GM clearly prepared a certain plot or adventure line, I can't help but be aware of that fact and have it influence my actions. I can't help but feel like, despite there being freedom within the boundaries of the adventure, there's still a fairly clear limit to freedom, and there's a rebellious side in me that finds that knowledge frustrating, like I'm forced to dance to someone elses tune. 

All of this frankly makes me feel a little alienated from the community at large, because this way of playing is massively popular (mostly due to 5e's success). All my friends play that way and like it, but as I've gotten frustrated with the playstyle, I feel less enjoyment playing or running those games. I wish I could fully share their enjoyment as I once did, because in the end that's the most valuable thing this hobby has given me.

1fo6bgk,What are the most important OSR principles and how does 5e prevent you from applying them?,"We often talk about the OSR philosophy and how it improves the game, specifically in contrast to modern D&D in the shape of 5e.

5e has its own design philosophy that definitely contradicts many OSR ideas, but here is my question: **Is there anything actually stopping you from running an OSR campaign in 5e?**

What I mean by that is that technically, a design *philosophy* can simply be ignored when setting up a campaign. Many of the principles are not tied to the ruleset, but to the design of the adventure itself.

- 5e is designed with balanced encounters in mind? Ignore that, make everything unbalanced.
- 5e has low lethality due to higher HP? Make everything deal more damage / again, take higher-level enemies.
- 5e usually means simply charging into combat and not engaging with the world intelligently? Well, that's mostly an issue of setting up player expectations correctly.

So I guess it seems to me that *technically* it would not be difficult to implement the OSR philosophy regardless of which ruleset I'm using, even if it is something like 5e.

But are there any core features of OSR that are simply not present in 5e (and really in any non-OSR modern RPGs)? Where bringing back the OSR feeling would require significant homebrewing to the point that using 5e is flat out the wrong choice?

Disclaimer: I dislike 5e for various reasons. Most of all, every class is a spellcaster and everything feels bland because any restrictions have gone out the window along with any world building that goes along with it. You can be a warlock with a celestial patron, stuff like that. But ignoring these things, I do not see how 5e limits OSR play.

1h4yjuy,How big are megadungeons?,"Instead of chiming in on every thread about megadungeons to point out that Caverns of Thracia isn’t a megadungeon, I’m going to post some data around the most commonly-cited megadungeons to try to ground the discourse in empirical terms.

Adventure / number of rooms

Caverns of Thracia: 116

Castle Xyntillan: 350+

Barrowmaze: 400+

Stonehell: 700+

Gunderholfen: 900+

Rappan Athuk: 1000+

Arden Vul: 2000+

For some non-megadungeon context:

Caves of Chao (KotB): 58

Hole in the Oak: 57

Incandescent Grottoes: 58

HitO and IG combined (a suggestion made by many fans of the dungeons): 115

Megadungeons are often defined as being big enough to support an entire campaign, or being practically un-finishable. Real-world campaign length is typically measured in sessions. At a modest 8 rooms per session, we get roughly:

Hole in the Oak: 7 sessions

Thracia: 15

Xyntillan: 45

Barrowmaze: 50

Stonehell: 90

Gunderholfen: 110

RA: 120

AV: 250

In those terms, I’d characterize HitO and Thracia as big dungeons finishable in several levels of play, Xyntillan as a tentpole that will occupy almost all of a level 1-6 campaign, and Barrowmaze as finishable only by the most dedicated groups playing to level 8+. All the megadungeons beyond that fit the ‘you can’t finish/beat them‘ definition.

The discourse around megadungeons has been going on for around 15 years now. In that period, Thracia has been recognized as a classic. And yet it’s only the last few years that I’ve seen it referred to as a megadungeon. So something has changed in the discourse.

It seems that as the popularity of megadungeons has increased (not least as a marketing term), its meaning on forums has expanded to the point that it’s applied to any dungeon that’s larger than average size, or takes more than a handful of sessions to play.

Another factor might be the focus in today’s OSR on relatively short, low-level campaigns that wrap up by 5th level. In that context, something like Thracia is closer to a whole-campaign dungeon.

This post might come across as grouchy and pedantic. But my livelihood involves both writing and precision, so I’m genuinely fascinated with how language evolves and meanings change and expand.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b2e917f0>,osr,1733155955.0
1inuxzp,How to deal with constant character death?,"Heyo!

How to deal with constant character death?
The problem **ISN'T** that the game is deadly or that characters die. They *like* that.

I'm playing with children (12-15) as part of my job and their characters are *constantly* dying.
Now that's fine, they actually like the challenge and that it's unforgiving.
(It's more demoralising to me, who'd just gotten the wizard inducted into the Mage Guild, he'd picked up a spell book and learned ""sleep"" and then he died stupidly opening a door. All that cool RP and NPCs for nothing)

But story-wise there's supposedly a constant stream of adventurers leaving Hubtown and going to ""check for their buddies in that adventuring party"" and then joining them and replacing the dead guys.
It's lame, but on the other hand, the new players/newly created character needs to be able to join immediately. Sure, they can have to wait ten minutes, but they have to be able to rejoin the group and be part of the game relatively quickly.

Do you guys have any good ideas as to how I can make this happen?
Something something Adventurer's Guild maybe?

Basically I just need old characters to go (in case someone has to leave/is picked up) and a way to get new ones in.
If it's at all possible to do it just sorta seamless, that'd be great.

1ib7t7u,I Have To Advertise B/X as a JRPG,"'I Have to Advertise My OSE Game as a JRPG or: How I Learned to Love The Displacement of Traditional Western Fantasy'

Or something

Tldr: Is Japanese fantasy currently more OSR than Western fantasy?

I live in a very rural and sparsely populated area. Everyone who I can get in touch with who wants to play a tabletop game only wants to do 5e. Other systems simply don't exist locally. 

Well, I'm trying to change that. Advertising online for a rather small-medium (under 10 sessions) in-person 'dnd' campaign, using Black Wyrm of Brandonsford for OSE at my tiny local game store. Nothing super crazy or big additions, just semi RAW B/X Basic with some light touches. Milqutoast as it gets.

So people come to inquire, ""Can I play homebrew classes?"" ""What races do you allow?"" ""Here's my character concept"" ""This is for 5e?"" 

I look at it all and try to approximate the best response to these Gen Z hotshots. 

""So Dungeon Meshi, right? And Berserk? Okay, now combine those two."" - ""Ohhhhh. I get it. Sure."" 

I only have passing familiarity with both of those IPs. I'm not super keen on Japanese fantasy media. I played Final Fantasy 10 when I was, well, 10. 

And yet somehow, it clicks that the best way I can explain in an elevator pitch what the concept of B/X is, is not any comparisons to Lord of the Rings (not actually that many young people have seen or read it) or Conan the Barbarian or even just describing a trimmed down 5th Edition Forgotten Realms or even Baldurs Gate. 

I now have to categorize and appeal to Japanese fantasy media to justify not playing 5e.

And then it clicks again; is it just me or does the current generation (or perhaps fixation) of Japanese Fantasy in video games, manga and anime resemble and in media, preserve, OSR and post-OSR (or just Gygaxian fantasy) concepts more than most modern Western fantasy iterations? I could go on and on, but I think you might get the point. 

Im not a JRPG or Japanese-Western fantasy afficionado, so feel free to correct me if I misunderstand or misworded specific ideas. 

What do you think? I'm genuinely curious to hear what people observe on the matter. Have you experienced anything similar? ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b2ef4c20>,osr,1737981273.0

Greetings from the Dens!

Back in December 1999 me (Stephen Chenault), Mac Golden, and my brother Davis Chenault started [Troll Lord Games](https://trolllord.com/). We released our first products at Gen Con 2000 and a few months after that we jumped into publishing d20 content for Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Ed. In ’01 we picked up [Gary Gygax](https://trolllord.com/worlds-of-gary-gygax/) and became his primary publisher. In, 04 we released the first printing of the [Castles & Crusades](https://trolllord.com/castles-crusades/) Players Handbook, our own RPG with its driving attribute check system, the SIEGE ENGINE. Today we are running a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ckg/castles-and-crusades-reforged?ref=1a2oss) for the 10th printing of that very same book.

Being a gamer all of my life, I love to talk gaming and decided it was time I reached out again to the RPG community here on Reddit and spend the evening answering any questions you wonderful folks on Reddit may have!

**My short bio:** My name is Stephen Chenault, one of the founding members and present CEO of Troll Lord Games. We make table top role playing games! Our flagship product is Castles & Crusades, a fast-paced, easy-to-learn OGL game. We launched in 1999 (though I started gaming back in the woebegone days of the 1970s) with a series of adventures and world settings. Within a few short months, we had signed on Gary Gygax, launched our fantasy game [Castles & Crusades](https://trolllord.com/castles-crusades/), our modern, Multi-Genre RPG, [Amazing Adventures](https://trolllord.com/amazing-adventures/), and a host of other projects and games. We’ve published books for both 3rd edition D&D and 5th edition D&D. We just did a soft announcement of our new rpg that is on the horizon, [BARSOOM: The Roleplaying Game](https://trolllord.com/barsoom/).

**The Job:** My primary job is managing the day-to-day operations of Troll Lord Games, from conception to printing. I do a fair bit of writing for the company for both Castles & Crusades and the [World of Aihrde](https://trolllord.com/world-of-aihrde/), as well as fiction and reference material. I do two weekly Twitch shows, a weekly AMA and Troll Round Up, and I also blog about all sorts of things, from world-building to the alien crash at Roswell! Currently, my focus lies on the release of the Codex of the Planes, The Dungeons of Aufstrag, and fiction material for the world of Aihrde.

**Ask me Anything!** I’ll answer just about anything I can from TLG news and history, to working with Gary Gygax, general RPGs, C&C, projects we’ve released/are releasing/plan to release, industry news, game design, setting design, , or whatever enters your noodle space!

1j8em6w,Why anyone told me about Cairn before?,"Man, I wish someone had told me about Cairn two years ago when I was still grinding through 5E. Like, where was this game when I was flipping through spell lists and juggling ability modifiers? It’s just so clean—no fuss, no bloat, just straight to the good stuff.

The way it handles characters, exploration, and danger is exactly what I didn’t know I was looking for back then. No rigid classes, just who you are and what you carry. And the game actually trusts you to be creative instead of boxing you into a list of pre-approved actions. It’s wild how much freedom it gives without ever feeling loose or undefined.

If I had known about Cairn back then, I probably would’ve spent way less time stressing over mechanics and way more time actually playing.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b2f73740>,osr,1741654480.0
1d83fvc,"On 5e Youtubers, and the OSR Playstyle.","Maybe it's just me, but I've noticed something recently in the content of many popular 5e youtubers, like Ginny Di, Deficient Master, Bob World Builder, and a few others.

The thing is that in their most recent videos where they explain how to write and scructure adventures and run games they seem to take the approaches that we've been doing for a long time: letting the emergent narrative do its thing, and have players solve problems with wits rather than mechanical power.

When 5e was at its most popular, railroads also were. Adventures were linear and structured, and challenges had clear, skill-check-based solutions. Now the trend is in the opposite direction:

* Ginny Di is talking about letting the players set their own goals in-backstory and letting the narrative play out automatically, rather than planning it. By the way she talks about this, it seems like she's unaware (?) that all this is remarkably OSR-adjacent. I'm quite possibly wrong.
* Deficient Master regualrly hints at his OSR inspiration, and often adapts OSR concepts to the mechanics of 5e and the tastes of the 5e audience.
* Bob World Builder is the one of these three that most closely uses the structure of OSR games, and most often engages with OSR products directly. He recommends Cairn as ""the default starter RPG"", and recommends trying Shadowdark before moving to 5e after that. In other circumstances, he states that the best 5e starter set is Icespire Peak, which is the one that most closely, IMO, resembles OSR playstyle.

As I write this in my deranged frenzy, I ask you: is it just me, or is the OSR slowly leaking out into the 5e community? Is this a sign that the OSR is gonna become mainstream in the TTRPG community at large?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b2fe6960>,osr,1717523542.0

I can of course do my own thing until all our dice are absorbed by an expanding sun, but since I'm here I thought I would ask.

1ion3g3,I' a bit lost with how OSR works,"I've discovered OSR a few years ago with DCC, but it hasn't been until a few weeks ago that I learned about OSR and the big community it is.    
From my understanding, it's a translation, an adaptation, a version, of the original d&d, but there soooo many different games that are osr, that I don't understand how it works.     
Like Basic Fantasy, is it the same as DCC? The same as Swords and Wizardry? The same as Labyrinth Lord, Tunnels & Trolls, Shadowdark?     
      
There has to be, of course, differences. The main question, and why I ask this, is because I keep reading about how every OSR module can work wirh any OSR system, but that bugs me at the same time, because they have to be different.

1gbyo6u,"As a PLAYER, have you ever had fun dealing with encumbrance?","I love encumbrance as a referee. I believe it forces you into difficult decision making, weighing trade offs of carrying this treasure back home or keeping this tool that may prove useful as you continue. It leads to tense moments where your arrows or torches are close to running out.

That said, after years of running games with strict encumbrance rules I have yet to see my players actually ever experience that or enjoy the encumbrance mechanic.

I hope I am just doing something wrong and can fix it so my players get to experience the tense fun I intend to offer them, but I am starting to wonder if maybe I should give up and just stop caring about encumbrance.

1j2mfa2,"D&D 5e player, interested in Old School Essentials.  Looking for experiences.","Hi everyone,

I've played D&D since 4e, but I've always gravitated to using running games with less emphasis on rules and limiting longer combat sessions.  I didn't really understand the history of D&D and that there was a basic / extended version of D&D that was separate from AD&D.

That leads me to my post.  I'm interested in how OSE (B/X) differs from 5e (at a high level).  Are there folks here that have experience with both (I'd imagine the answer is yes)?  What are the strengths / weaknesses of both systems.  Are there any serious limitations with OSE (B/X) that people have run into?  Do players sometimes complain?

I'm hopeful that OSE would be a good fit for our gaming group.

Thanks for any advice!

1hixrl8,Thoughts on Cairn 2e?,"I just got myself the Cairn player's guide (haven't had a chance to look at the warden's guide) and I found myself.. really disapointed. I mean I know OSR is more rulings over rules but the book seemed to be mostly filled with tables, of which 80% required the GM to make up some mechanic or even what something actually was; the Omen's portion was especially egregious.

And also, some of the backgrounds would have you roll on the omen's table and keep it secret from everyone... even the GM? Literally how is that supposed to work? This book just mostly seems to be random tables and only the most bare bones of rules. I have the Tome of Adventure Design and Worlds Without Number... why do I need more random tables?

I'm sure I'm not the only one in a similar position, but if I want to play and run games regularly in person I have to play 5e or fight tooth and nail for players. 

Has anyone got any experience with the new 2024 rules and have opinions on which version I might be able to run something that I don't hate. My initial thoughts are that the rules will at least be less bloated in that I can play PHB only, and I might have a better chance at overcoming ingrained play culture because it's ""new"".

Why not roll under opponent dexterity for attack roll? If you roll under it you hit and roll damage.

Armor could absorb/reduces damage instead.

1ix9bw8,Rant about learning a complex game system instead of an OSR,"Hi, with my long time group (D&D 2e), we were having a talk about our next game system.

We are playing Stars Without Number (20th game in the campaign and it's great, enough crunch/customization IMO) just after many 10y+ with 5e. It's a good chance and 3/4 of the group love it.. Solo, I played with OSE, Olde Swords Reign and just started Shadowdark. 

My interest in 5e faded away a few years ago. Something was lost in the game and I discovered the OSR indie designers. Got 1 rule book, then many, and bough many adventures. I'm in a happy place.

Yesterday, someone asked to start a new campagin and play 5.5e after SWN.  
  
Since, I don't want to go back to 5.5e, I'm quite vocal. In short, as you probably, the game has too many rules/exceptions + rule lawers, combats are too long, we have uninspiring marvel super heroic abilities for every classes,  and we ended up with a table of power gamers that consulted guides on how to build the most perfect build.... the game becomes unbalance and it's a slog to play.  
  
The DM is listening to all of us and has the final say since he invests time in building the campaign. He wants the group to be happy and he is undecided. I know he enjoyed SWN. A few months ago, I DM a few games of Low Fantasy Gaming and showed them an alternative to 5e. But some players rely to much on the character sheet for abilities and are rule lawyer. They don't like SWN or LFW... and probably they won't like OSR nor Shadodark. This could sound harsh, but their imagination has been brainwased and marvelled by super heroic abilities.

Then, I realized that the DM for 5E has to stop to read/memorize the PHB (5e) and could not track anymore what abilities/feats are doing for everyone, and what is available/upcoming. Something that was never a problem with 1e/2e. Same with the spells, especially the news ones or variants.   
  
Same for my friends: Nobody knows how to play the other characters since they are too complex with all the choices after level 3 or something like that. Maybe one player has a juggernaut memory to remember all the rules, abilities, spells, good for him....

And it bothered me a lot: Why do we play a game where the DM cannot wrap is head around the classes and abilities? Is this a big deal, probably not but I added that to my stack of reasons why we should not bother with 5.5e.  
  
So, I have hard time understanding/convincing my group that 5e. You probably have experience with this since we are in the OSR channel...   
  
Yes, we could split the group since half wants to play SWN/WWN and the other half wants 5.5e. But I'm bothered by the fact that the 5e+ DM/players are not reading the PHB and still wants to play *that* game. I'm angry a little I guess that they could not see that the Without Number game is fun with less crunch and a few combat options... where rules are simple and that we call all enjoy our custom build with unique Talents/Focis and skills...

1gkg8vo,Do you prefer race-as-class or race + class? Why?,"I normally prefer having both race and class as it feels more natural; having a race also be a class feels one-dimensional if EVERY elf can fight and cast spells, every dwarf is basically a fighter, and so on.  It's a big reason I was NOT a fan of the Basic D&D style as opposed to Advanced D&D, along with not liking the sandbox and hexcrawl approaches so common in the OSR.



However, the more I think about it, the more it also makes demi-humans feel alien and, well, not human. They feel completely unique and it makes the world feel different, rather than elves/dwarfs/etc feeling like humans with extras. For example, I feel like in a setting where elves are both a race and a class it feels more ""foreign"" to have an elf kingdom that's like Lothlorien rather than an elf kingdom that's like a human kingdom but with elves, with various classes like humans.

1f3scds,"B/X is so intuitive, I don't have to really ""prep"" anymore session to session.  ","To be clear, it was a lot of work before the game started.  I run Jacob Fleming's OSE modules with two groups on roll20, and before the first sessions I  uploaded all the maps (world, dungeon, and some wilderness encounters), as well as monster and npc tokens I would maybe need for several sessions. 

But now all I have to do is just roll encounters before a game.  It's all up to the players entirely on where to go and what to do.  I get to use my brain power during the session to run monsters during encounters and describe what's happening.  

No more laying down ""track"" of where players can go or trying to predict their movements.  Oh, you want to abandon the town under siege and go off into the mountains to go hunting?  Sure, you have the rations?  

No more fretting over balanced encounters.  Players  (mostly) approach the world and encounters with extreme caution because characters can actually die. I get to just enjoy listening to them strategize on what to do.  

No more DC nonsense. Roll under for an ability or over for a save.  Me and the players just decide when it's necessary, and often times it isnt unless its stated.  

Dungeon and wilderness exploration is guided by clear cut procedures. 

Combat procedures, in particular, ensure encounters are strategic and dramatic. No three hour slogs.  Characters die, but nothing ever seems unfair or contrived.  

No more thinking of mission hooks.  At first it was gold the players were after to level up, but over time the players, not me, built the story based on their actions.  Treasure is still a top priority, though.  

At the end of a session all I do is make a couple of notes on how the players actions may influence the world, record some of their ideas about what they think is happening and then, before next session roll up a few more encounters.  

I know this whole new dnd book is releasing this month, but I loathe the idea of having to go back and building the game while I'm driving it.  

After a year and half of play on my last 5e campaign I was totally burnt out and frustrated.  After a year and half of play on my OSE campaigns (plural) we are going strong and can't wait for the next session.  

I know I'm preaching to the choir with this but dang, coming B/X OSE was the best decision I ever made in the hobby.   It is a truly remarkable ttrpg system.

y6i3sx,My 5E Group Hated OSE - a post mortem.,"I'm pretty bummed out right now. After just 3 sessions I am pulling the plug on a new OSE campaign I started with friends just last month.  I'm not really sure the point of this post except to share my experience and some lessons learned.

I'd been wanting to run an OSE campaign for awhile but my friends love 5E and had no interest in it. A few of them adamantly said they will play nothing else but 5E.  ""Why do we need to learn a new system?"" was the common response.  I finally got to a point where I decided to just say ""hey, here's what I'm running... join if you'd like to.""  This was probably the first mistake but I was actually somewhat successful as people were interested in playing more D&D and so I sold it as this is D&D but an older version with lighter rules (more rulings, less rules).  The ""5E or nothing"" friends passed on it but I did get a few friends to commit to playing.

The campaign was set in the Wilderlands of High Fantasy and I scattered a bunch of level 1-2 dungeons (Hole in the Oak, Incandescent Grottoes) and mega-dungeons (Castle Xyntillan) around a local area of the map.  I put a couple plot hooks out there to lead the players to the dungeons.  This is where things started to fall apart.  This group in particular had very little player agency and they immediately became paralyzed by the number of choices.  Coming from 5E, they expected me to clue them in on the ""best"" choice.  They wanted me to spoon feed them the optimal choice.  This was the first sign that this wasn't going to work.

Eventually they chose a quest that would bring them to the Hole in the Oak dungeon. However, as luck would have it, they took a path through the dungeon that caused them to awaken the Spectral Hunter and Hounds as their first combat encounter (an extremely hard undead monster for 1st levels).  I emphasized running away and this being a nearly impossible fight at this level.  They made it out alive (shields were shattered) but this left an incredibly bad taste in their mouth.  This was definitely another big mistake on my part. Looking back, I probably shouldn't have triggered this encounter.  I did roll on the reaction table and gave the party a chance to negotiate a way out before combat began but everything went against the players that I felt I had to go through with the combat.  This group really did not like unbalanced encounters or the difficulty involved.  They were not prepared for the difficulty level.  When people say old school D&D is like Dark Souls, they ain't lying.

The next session the party went back to town and had to ""lick their wound"".  They hated how long it took to heal (spending a full day resting to recover 1d3).   They had burned a lot of resources (torches, rations, splintered shields) exploring the dungeon and had very little to show for it.    They sold what little treasure they did find and then had to replenish their supplies.  They started complaining about the mundane activities at this point... managing rations... managing torches... retainers.  They hated all of it.  They did not care for the micromanagement aspect at all or the verisimilitude that these systems provide. Planning for the adventure was not fun to them. They wanted to get straight to the adventure/dungeon and the narrative.

Wilderness travel was a mixed bag with them actively disliking the mechanics of it  (weather, checking lost chance, encounters, eating rations).  One friend commented that if they actually get lost and they spend a whole session wandering aimlessly he would quit.   At this point I realized that they all had no interest in ""emergent"" gameplay and really just wanted me to hand a narrative story/adventure to them.   Even when cool randomly generated map features came up they didn't bother to explore them and instead stuck to the ""quest""/narrative.  They stayed on the rails even though I was giving them a sandbox.

After this last session,  everyone had just about had enough.  The OSR play style was not jiving with them.  One by one they all agreed it was not for them and tapped out.

Unfortunately, the only OSR games I'm super familiar with are Troika and Morkborg, neither of which are particularly middle school friendly, what with the frequent piss references in Troika and the everything in Morkborg.

Do you have any good recommendations of OSR game systems that are suitable for middle schoolers just getting into the hobby? Preferably systems that have print copies available so that I can stock them in the library (I am the librarian after all).

Any help is appreciated! Thank you so much!!

Edit: it sounds like the general consensus points to OSE, B/X, Shadowdark, or Basic Fantasy RPG.

1hx8p37,Rolling for hit points... why?,"I'm very much for the idea of making characters with no real vision, rolling 3d6 in order, and seeing what you get. I'm very much for not fudging and letting it play out. What I've never really gotten is rolling for hit points.

People have had this discussion for decades, so I won't relitigate anything. In short, I just don't even get why it's (still) a thing. What would you lose if you just used a table that told you how many hit points you had based on your class and level, modified by Constitution? I'm not sure hit points are so dynamic a thing that having them be largely randomized is that desirable. 

That way, you avoid randomness taking away class niches (such as the 1st level Thief rolling higher hit points than the Fighter), 1st level one hitpoint wonders, and people getting screwed by RNG. Plus, I think wildly varying hit points can result in characters doing strange things for entail reasons, such as a high strength 1st level Fighter avoiding melee combat because their hit points are really low.

Obviously, the standard method has been used for decades, so it works. I guess averages do tend to work out; statistical anomalies on the low side will be weeded out most of the time and replaced with characters with better hit point rolls (and if not, subsequent levels should get them to normal). Plus, it can be worked around; a hut point crippled 1st level Fighter could just focus on ranged combat and avoid melee combat.

Overall, though, I'm just not sure hit points benefit from randomness. I think it can unnecessarily cripple characters while adding a weird meta element with little in-game basis. I'm not opposed to randomized advancement (I love Fire Emblem); I just think it's odd to only have hit points advance randomly, and not to hit chance, spell slots, saving throws, etc too.

I'm definitely open to having my mind changed, though. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b421ac00>,osr,1736412897.0

And to this I always respond ""in 5e a balanced encounter is when will you kill all the monsters before any of the PCS die"". In osr a balanced encounter is when you kill the monsters before all the PCs die.

In other words a balanced encounter is equal to a fair fight. And it would be foolish to engage in a fight to the death that your party has equal odds of losing. At best one or two of you might survive.

What you really want is a fight of overwhelming odds when you kill all the monsters before any of you die but that is hardly balanced.

far more important than creating a ""balanced"" encounter is telegraphing to your players the difficulty of the encounter so they can decide whether and how to engage with it.

1i8do87,Old School Essentials -- Motivating Players to Keep Retainer Alive,"I've run into a problem in my OSE games. The mechanics of the game incentivize the players to get the retainers killed in the dungeon so they don't have to pay them a share of the treasure, so the PCs get to keep all the gold and XP for themselves. Now, they haven't been murderous bastards and slit the retainers throats or anything, but I still feel like it creates a narrative problem when the main characters just keep grinding through hired help. How can I get the game to encourage them to keep retainers alive?

The first thing I've tried is making them essentially post a bond on the retainers life of 50 gp per level. They post it with some local authority, and get it back if the retainer comes back alive. If they die, it goes to their next of kin. But as they started to get more and more gold as they leveled up, this became a non-issue. I could adjust the price in future.

Or perhaps the retainers could still earn their share for their families, even if they die. This is a bit harder to justify, since they're not doing any work once dead.

**EDIT: UPDATED ANNOUNCEMENT**

***Upcoming Print-on-Demand Book Price Changes – Effective April 1, 2025***

*We always want to keep print costs as low as possible, and it has been years since we passed any price increases through to our publishing partners.*

*However, our print supplier, Lightning Source/Ingram, has announced a price adjustment starting April 1, 2025, that will be reflected on DriveThru sites.*

***Key Changes***

* _Due to increasing supply costs in the US, **Black & White print costs in the US will increase significantly**, from around 20% for low-pagecount hardcover titles up to about 50% or slightly more for large hardcover books, and with softcover titles seeing an even greater increase._
* _**UK print costs for Black & White books will also increase**, but generally only by 3-4%._
* _**Standard Color print costs will increase**, by roughly 12-13% for US printing but only around 3% for UK printing._
* _On the whole, **Premium Color print costs will decrease slightly for US printing but increase slightly for UK printing.**_
     * _Example 1: A 180-page large premium hardcover currently costs $32.10 to print in the US; after April 1, that same title will drop to $27.80._
     * _Example 2: In the UK, the same 180-page book currently costs £20.23, which will increase to £20.93 starting in April._

Above will most likely lead to publishers increasing prices on the books, especially those who use at-cost pricing. I ordered all hardbacks from my wish-list, just in case. :)

1ioyxjm,Something I’ve noticed lately rant…," It seems for all our bragging about “problem solving” people seem to play everything like a video game these days. The OSR community likes to say “hey we dont have a bunch of gizmos and powers you gotta use your noggin” and then proceed to close the gap and melee melee melee and nothing else during battle or say “ I search for traps” and nothing else, as if that wasnt the most vague statement on earth. Ive been running games for 15 years, and sadly this inadvertent human experiment has shown me most people just dont really think creatively so why brag about it? You might be saying “ Hey change your encounters so they have to be more intriguing” even then, people get frustrated and just fuss, negotiate and scheme to close the gap and bonk (for the combat example). So why this chip on the shoulder that our dungeons are cooler if you have GMs playing boring RAW crap and not awarding creative play? 

Maybe I keep finding sucky players and Im a total tyrant and youre criticizing me in your head, Im ready to believe that. I always think of how Bender used the fire spell to create steam and escape in that one special, thats the kinda play we should praise above all else, not “Uhhhh the dragon saw you anyway that was dumb and did nothing”. It breeds power players and nervous nellys who never want anything more than to stay alive, which translates to - I wanna do max damage with the best thing i have- and any other form of conquering the challenge proves useless or punishable to the character. Players miss clues, nuance and even magic items cause they have this go go go power player attitude even in OSR circles at times. 

Granted many times I have had groups that are definitely super clever, but so many times I feel like people have Covid IPad kid brain now and roleplay like a bag of rocks.

For the past 8 years, I've been working on a game called **_His Majesty the Worm_**.

# What is His Majesty the Worm?

*His Majesty the Worm* is a new-school game with old-school sensibilities: the classic megadungeon experience given fresh life through a focus on the mundanities and small moments of daily life inside the dungeon.

* **Food, hunger, light,** and **inventory management** are central to play and actually fun.

* **Tarot cards** are used to create an action-packed combat system that ensures that all players have interesting choices every minute of combat: no downtime!

* The game has **robust procedures.** Adventure in the Underworld, rest in roleplaying-driven camping scenes, and plot long-term schemes in the City at the center of the Wide World.

* The relationships between companions, called **Bonds,** powers the rest and recovery mechanic of the game. The game centers the human element. 

The game is intended for a traditional setup between a single GM and 3-6 players. It emphasizes long-term, Metroidvania-like play. Tarot cards are used as a randomizing element. If you like things like _Dungeon Meshi_ or _Rat Queens_, you might find something fun in this game.

**You can learn more about the game, and find links to buy either the physical or digital editions, [on our website](https://www.hismajestytheworm.games/)!**

(When it launched, the physical edition sold out within 3 hours. The books are now restocked at Exalted Funeral!)

1hgqz46,is basic fantasy roleplaying game good if i like 5e but want a lighter game?,"pretty much my title!!! i like the vibe and feeling of 5e d&d where it's kinda heroic and high fantasy with lots of magic, but i just feel quite drained/tired after dming a session of it and i notice we seem to have rules arguments we dont have when i dm other games like call of cthulhu!!! so i've been trying to look at other fantasy rpgs instead but i feel so overwhelmed by all the choice!! 

is basic fantasy rpg a good choice for me? or does anyone have other recommendations!!! 

edit: THANK YOU for all the suggestions everyone!!! i really appreciate it!!!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b4872b70>,osr,1734487027.0
1isutyr,OSR games that still have meaningful chargen?,"I've been delving more into the OSR realm recently since I have found that, as someone who started his rpg journey with dnd 5e, I have been craving something more akin to what I now know to be OSR games. I've been reading quite a few and am loving what I'm reading for the most part, but Im noticing that a part of OSR seems to be very limited character generation.

Now to be clear, I totally get the reasoning behind this. OSR leans very heavily toward being about what you do vs who you are, and I agree with the sentiment that a lot of modern rpgs (that Ive played) sort of frontload the decision making into chargen. Before you even start the first session you know essentially what your character has done, does, and will continue to do. To the point, I really enjoy the IDEA of making character generation the first of many stepping stones rather than an ever-important cornerstone of your journey.

My dilemma is that most of the OSR games Ive been recommended have either randomly generated characters or ""pick a template go from there"" characters, and I don't find that as fun. I don't need it to take an hour to roll a character, hell I don't even need to have a bunch of points and boxes to check, but I do want something that leaves the storytelling to the actual game itself while still making chargen an actual important part of the journey.

For example of two games that I really like: His Majesty the Worm and Trespasser both don't seem to have this problem for me, Trespasser toes the line with its ""semi randomized"" nature but your character choices do feel meaningful later. 

TLDR; Im looking for your favorite OSR games that have character generation that, even if very limited or lacking depth, still ends up mattering or at least allows for customization. I also dont particularly want anything D&D, Id like to branch out.

EDIT: going to pase one of my responses here since it seems I didnt really clarify what meaningful meant to me, 
when I say meaningful I dont mean ""fundamentally changes how I play"" I just mean that I want to make decisions that literally have a meaning mechanically. I can go into nearly any system and make non-mechanical decisions about appearance and backstory and so on (which OSR encourages in spades), but I want something a little bitty step above that. Something to choose or some resource to allocate or a specialty to choose that fundamentally differentiates me from the players beside me, even if it is really niche or not as impactful as what comes later.

1j7n1ib,Do you actually like spells having levels? (rambly musing),"I kinda feel like I don't. But I also don't like a lot of the alternatives that seem to be popular. 

I think this was the thing that has made working on my Cairn hack so difficult, was wanting to move away from the silly spontaneity of the Knave/Cairn spell list. I eventually did arrive on something that mostly works for me. But I don't think I could look back now.  I guess I don't hate the idea of rarer, extra-powerful spells. But restricting them to higher-level characters feels... wasteful and constraining to me. I dunno. I wonder how I'll implement spells in future games.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b48a8590>,osr,1741569394.0
1hf68in,Afraid to Do Anything,"I joined an OSR group a couple years ago, and I've been enjoying for the most part.

One thing that has hindered my enjoyment at times is the fear of doing anything ""wrong"".

The way this group plays, if you make a wrong or ""stupid"" decision, it can easily kill you, or even TPK

For example, in one session, we were hired to do a job. We did said job, and later heard that employer was involved in some missing people. We went to the employer's house to ask some questions regarding this. Later that night, the employer sent a creature that one shot all of us to the inn we were staying at. The only reason we didn't TPK was because the DM essentially retconned us winning the fight. The DM said we should have never gone to the employer's house to ask questions. 

Things like this have resulted in me being afraid to do anything, make decisions, or take any action in games. I'm too afraid to make a ""dumb"" decision and be embarrassed and die. Is this just something that is a part of OSR style play, or is this just tough DMing? ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b48cede0>,osr,1734307674.0

For me B/X games seems to be a little too basic for my taste, I tend to want at least a little more character choices and customization than B/X tends to offer.

1gqqwsb,Will gonzo high-level play ever make its way into the modern OSR scene?,"The recent thread comparing 5E unfavourably for its overpowered PCs got me thinking about how selective the OSR movement is about approaches to play in the early D&D scene. You just have to flip through something like the original Rogue’s Gallery to see high-powered, gonzo PCs drawn the real games of TSR’s stable of writers and their friends.

Nothing captures the gonzo high-level play of yore like the Day of the Dwarf, an actual play account by TSR designer Roger Moore, published in Dungeon magazine issue 42 (Oct 1980):

>“We were setting up for one of our high level adventures; there was a rumour in the area where we lived of a new monster lair, in the Firefall Mountains to the West, that held unparalleled treasures. We had most of the known artifacts, but this sounded like something different. We agreed it was going to be worth a try.

>”It was going to be too unwieldy to bring all of our henchmen, hirelings, and armies, so each of us brought only our main player-character, steed, and familiars as required. Joanna brought her Paladin lady and her horse with the mithril barding, and managed to get special dispensation from her church (The First Temple of Wonder Woman) to bring all seven of her holy swords. Alan took his storm giant and mattock of the titans, and led the party alongside Jerry’s golden dragon character. Jerry griped a lot because he couldn’t take Farah, Kate, and Jacqueline, his henchdragons, but Dan had been firm. Belinda got her brownie, her homonculous, and her two golf bag full of wands, staves, rods, an scepters, and saddled up her unicorn, riding beside George’s arch-Druid/Bard, and Isaac’s eleven Ranger/Cleric/Magic-User with the mutant horse (he called it Bruce or something) he’d gotten on another plane. I took out my caveman and +5 vorpal battleaxe, and became the rear-guard. Above us flew Margie and her pegasus, serving as air cover and emergency medic (16th level clerics are much appreciated in our group). Margie worked as a nurse in the hospital downtown, and she fit the role of cleric well. Before setting out, we agreed as a group to hold down psionics and we swore not to summon any gods into the adventure; we’d been quested so many times that we know the Abyss like the back of our hands.”

I’m curious if this approach to D&D will ever be revived by the OSR scene, or if the OSR brand and ethos are too firmly wedded to low-level, lower-powered play.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b4a96150>,osr,1731540681.0
1gka7c6,Cairn 2e thoughts,"Holy shit, I just read through Cairn 2e, and I’m seriously impressed. It’s got two books—the Player’s Guide and the Warden’s Guide—and together they offer everything you could ask for and pull you in to a really interesting and unique new setting. The new classes in the Player’s Guide are exactly the kind of thing that makes you want to start rolling up a character on the spot. The names are a little funky (""Jongluer"" instead of ""Bard,"" for example), but it’s all part of the vibe and work when taken all together.

The art nails it, too—simple and not distracting mostly, but fun where it matters in the class descriptions with unique things like robot arms and fungal mutations to support the quirky setting. The rules stay super-lite but with enough added structure to really support a long-term game for just about anyone. I love rules-lite games and this really hits a sweet spot for simple rules with just enough support. Plus, both books are super readable, with clean layouts and artwork that’s atmospheric without trying too hard.

The second book, the Warden’s Guide, completely nails it on the world-building side. The d20 tables absolutely rock. Every entry flows, no awkward combos, and the map creation tools and dungeon building systems are set up to balance detail without bogging you down. Everything item on every list has clearly been carefully curated and considered before being included. The hex crawl rules are right on target for me, too. Everything fits together smooth as hell. I haven't been this excited to bust out the paper and pencils and build something from scratch in a long time! Super cool!

Character advancement’s always been a bit of a question mark for me with Cairn, but the examples here make it a lot easier to grasp. I’m not totally sold yet, but I’m much more open to trying it out with these examples for support.

**And the best part: Yochai Gal released both books for free! Nearly 300 pages of pro-quality content, and he didn’t charge a single dime.** In the OSR scene these days, it’s rare to see something of this caliber free of charge, and it’s a super classy move, right up there with Chris Gonnerman's BFRPG, Charlie Mason's White Box, and other classic pillars of the community. Cairn’s had a huge fanbase for a while, but with the extra content in Cairn 2e it really feels like a new classic to me now. 

Reading these books totally made my day. I can't wait to roll up some guys and send them on a quest!

1jezpu2,Simplicity of B/X but with lots of character customization? Is there a system like this?,"Hi,

I know that usually player customization goes against simplicity and ease of creation. The moment you start adding a lot of different options during character creation you end with D&D 5e.

Nevertheless, I think there can be a way to both have simplicity and character customization. As a player, I like the idea of feats, being able to have very distinct abilities and seeing a nice progression.

I know ShadowDark offers some customization, but is random and is not like you have a lot of things to choose from.

Olde Swords Reign seem more aligned to what I want. But I think there is still room for more player customization.

I guess AD&D has a lot of customization, but people have describite it as a little clunky, with lots os different rules that sometimes don't match very well (sorry, I'm not an expert, surely AD&D has lot of really nice things to offer and I'm sure a lot of you are having tons of fun wiht it).

I also don't enjoy tactical combat that much. I prefer customization more in relation to exploration or narrative. I like feats like being able to breath under water or turning into a goblin. I don't care that much about complex combat manouvers.

I guess what I'm looking for is a system where you have an easy body of rules that are easy to understand but on top of that you have a detailed system of feats, aspects, magic, items, weapons; and its focus is not combat. Something that is easy to grasp but offers a lot of depth.

1cdh7wx,How much is the issue OSR has with 5E/Modern DnD the ruleset or the culture?,"5e was made to court the OSR playerbase at first, alongside all other disparate DnD playerbases.

They had two very popular then, but very infamous now, figures in OSR space to help them when making that game. I've even trawled the internet a bit in search of people's opinion on it back when it was released.

I mean 'Rulings Not Rules' was an attempt at tying some OSR principles into 5e, but I think the main reason that OSR rejects 5e is more the kind of players that has becomes it's main fanbase(alongside it's aesthetics). The assumptions they have are shaped by the rules yes but those assumption have always existed and 5e's popularity from APs made them more prominent.

Personally, I think the main issue is most people in the OSR have with 5e is 30% rules and 70% cultures. You can houserule something easy, but you can't make the majority of players to accept it--Feats are optional, but they're a major draw for players.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b4b5d190>,osr,1714124530.0

I've just now noticed something that seems problematic, but which I'm sure must have an explanation... the treasure you can find seems to be wildly out of proportion to the levelling process. An example:

The Elder of the village has a dinner service worth 6,000 gp. Let's say a Thief steals that service and manages to fence it for a 20% charge, that nets him 5,000 gp / 5,000 XP which would take him from 1st to 4th level! Even fencing it for 10% of the price would be enough to get him halfway to level 2... If the Thief happens to steal from the Grove, he can net 16,380 gp of gems and get most of the way to level 6 with one big score! Even if I only count coin, there's enough lying around to earn multiple levels.

Even if the party divides the coinage amongst themselves despite the Thief doing all the work, a single dinner set would get most classes to 2nd level.

I'm sure I'm doing something wrong here... can someone help me spot what it is? How do I manage this?

I was trying to understand if I was right about the rules and then figure out their implications for the adventure I was running. Why this deserves downvotes, I don't know... The fact that I'm running OSR & specifically chose a classic game should make it clear enough that I'm not attacking... I'm asking.*

*Seems to me that the most likely answer is that BX rules & AD&D modules have some different philosophical assumptions, the early adventures had some WIP wonkiness and for modern DMs, these can serve an opportunity to expand upon the game.*",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b4d58dd0>,osr,1726158704.0
1hu7adb,Just realised everyones playing 5E wrong. ,"I was talking to my uncles who like me only play AD&D and other OSR/NSR systems and they said that 5E was much closer to AD&D than 3rd which they hate. They dont play 5E either they stuck with there 2E homebrew, but I was suprised to hear them of all people say this.  They dont play 5E but it was wierd to hear them praise it after the way they talked about 3E.   
  
Maybe the reason 5E lacks so many rules and feels bland is cos its actually designed to be played like AD&D. No rule for it? Just do it and the DM will improvise the sky is the limit. Multiclassing is actually an optional rule so its implied you are not meant to use it. Without mutliclassing all the build culture kinda goes away, yes you get the option between a feat or a +2 to a stat but thats not a big deal, classes kinda do what they say on the tin.  
Also for about the first half of 5E PCs were 90% varient humans cos of the free feat. So it was human centric simular to gygax. Demi humans could be any class but generally had to go towards certain classes cos of how ability scores work. You could do a dwarven mage but he wouldnt be that good cos no int bonus.   


The big issue is 95% of groups play it like its 3.5 which has a rule for everything and will get the books out to argue witht he DM. However 5E apparantly has the same rule that AD&D has ""These rules are just guidelines. The DM can use the ones they like and ignore what they dont like."" as apposed to the 3.5/PF method of ""There is a rule for everything heres how you do it."" 

In a way 5Es a prime example of how gaming culture has just changed over the years. My current group are playing my NSR game, they are however new players, I think they did one 5E oneshot before but dont really have experience with RPGs. My system is based loosly off 2E and people will say stuff like ""Can I roll to do X."" as apposed to saying they are going to do something and then wait for me to respond if they need to roll something or maybe they just find something. 

I wonder if 5E would be a completely different game if it A: Was with the gaming style of ADND and B: Didnt use the optional multiclassing rules, C: Rolling stats was the meta, D: Was human centric ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b4d85820>,osr,1736084471.0

1ik33z5,Another West Marches/Open Table question: how on earth are you supposed to always get back to town?,"I'm sorry if this is a really dumb question but I don't know if I've ever seen it addressed in real detail, and I've read as many blogs and other West Marches posts as I can find without seeing a satisfactory answer.

I'm putting together an open table game and, in spite of my ADHD over-prep and perfectionism, trying to take to heart the advice that running multiple parties without having everyone get back to the central location at the end of each session *a la* West Marches is impossible.

But I can't wrap my head around how that itself is possible? It seems like a much harder requirement to consistently fulfill than just allowing different groups to wander the landscape at their own pace and dealing with plot entanglements as they pop up?

Assuming that the game world is dynamic and responds to player actions, that hexes get restocked after a while, that factions make their own moves etc; doesn't this mean that in practice the exploration radius for any given party will never extend beyond where they are able to travel in a single session?

Put differently: you can basically explore a day's travel in any given direction, but when the clock strikes midnight the adventure turns into a pumpkin and suddenly everyone has to go home?

Unless we're completely hand-waving travel back to town (no chance of random encounters etc), wouldn't getting back to the starting location occupy a larger and larger percentage of any given session as players fulfill the actual purpose of the campaign and explore more territory? What if they're in the middle of a massive combat?

I'm willing to accept that I'm overthinking this, but it also feels like I have to be missing something here because I am not an inexperienced GM and yet the logistics of not just shooting for, but *requiring* that the party return to base at the end of every session seems totally game breaking.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b4eb44a0>,osr,1738955790.0

17gpdz2,"Trying To Get Into OSR, Which Version of Classic D&D Should I Start With?","I've been terribly curious about the OSR for a long time. I've been getting very exhausted with the latest editions of the two biggest D20 games, and I've been sort of pining for something simpler, something older.

I'd been wanting to try Old School Essentials, but I just found out recently that OSE might not actually be the best way to get my feet wet, since it's designed as almost a reference document for people who are already familiar with Old School play.

It was recommended that I start with The Tomb of the Serpent Kings, because it's designed to teach old school play to people who aren't familiar with it, but I'll need a \*game\* to go with it.

My immediate thought is that I should try D&D Basic, but there are at least 2 different D&D Basics (B/X and BECMI), and I don't know if there are more, how they differ, or which one would be best to start with. Or maybe some other game would be better, like, Whitehack, or... something.

1ivh1a0,Fighter design,"Howdy people,

I am currently working on re-imagining the main 4 class types: fighter, thief, mage and cleric. So far I am very happy with my results besides ... the fighter.

I managed to design some pretty reasonable rules for the fighter, but ... how do you make a fighter more interesting? Especially considering his level progression? So far, most fighters I have seen so far consist of simply higher damage values, more attacks, more/better crits etc. So basically just bigger and better numbers. Yes, I am aware of the creative approach of mighty deeds from DCC.

But what makes a fighter a fighter ... outside of fighting? Do you know of any interesting rules for fighters they can utilize outside of combat (perhaps in role play, wilderness, survival etc.). Should a fighter perhapps be the only class (in the later stages of the game) to be allowed of ruling their own stronghold and domain?

Or is it enough, if a figher is just good at ... fighting?

I am mostly looking for progressive adjustments to the fighter class, besides bigger numbers. Interested to hear what you guys have to say and how you would go about to make a fighter more ... well-rounded :)

1ftpij5,"Has anyone done a ""standard"" style campaign using B/X, OSE, or other derivative?","It seems like the most common way of playing a B/X or clone-style game (OSE, Labyrinth Lord, Dragonslayer, et all) is either a sandbox (e.g. Keep on the Borderlands or Dolmenwood style open-ended setting), a hexcrawl (start in the middle and move around) or a megadungeon (e.g. Barrowmaze, Arden Vul, etc).  I'm curious if anyone has done a more ""traditional"" AD&D style campaign that isn't one of the above three with these rules, and if so what did you do/how did it turn out?

I like the simplicity of the B/X ""core"" (although I think it might be TOO simple to a lot of people; I know from personal experience decades ago that's the reason why I never played it as a kid when we were already playing AD&D 2nd edition; felt like a step backward) but I don't care for the sandbox/hexcrawl/megadungeon style of play that's so frequently seen; I much prefer the AD&D approach from the mid-80s and later.

Is this system just not really conducive to that style and that's why it's not often seen (e.g. why try to do that with B/X when you can do it with AD&D) or is it only that's the most fondly remembered approach (Keep and isle of dread are classic for a reason after all)?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b6103440>,osr,1727793060.0

12tots7,Why I replace the d20 with 3d8 in every d20 system I run.,"I originally implemented this houserule last year as part of a combat overhaul I was writing for 5e. I’ve since come to use it in any d20 system I run, and it has a huge number of benefits (many geared more toward OSR) that I wanted to share for others to consider or even try. As a disclaimer: I’m not saying this way is better, despite how much I prefer it, or that using a d20 is somehow worse. Every table runs things differently, and it’s hard to exaggerate the d20’s success in ttrpg. But, this simple replacement changes the feel of a game so drastically, I have to put forth an argument for it.

# The 3d8 engine:

* Any time you make a check that requires a d20, roll 3d8 instead, using the sum as your base roll and adding modifiers like normal. Positive circumstances or ‘advantage’ adds a d8, negative circumstances or ‘disadvantage’ subtracts a d8.
* For attacks, every natural 8 rolled adds a damage die, and two or more natural 8s trigger “critical” effects (automatic hits, status conditions, etc). If you’d like, you can say 2 or more natural 1s trigger fumbles as well.
* To compensate for the higher average roll, add between +2 and +4 to all target numbers/DCs (I do +2, more might be suitable to your table).

# The math:

Here’s what this does to the probabilities (skip this part if you don’t care about the math).

* Most importantly it turns the flat 5% distribution for any roll into a bell curve, where middle or average rolls are more likely, while rolls at the highest and lowest ends of the range are less likely.
* It gives you a wider range of rolls (3 to 24), and increases the average roll from 10.5 to about 13.5.
* There’s a 3 in 8 chance of getting some extra damage, but a 3 in 64 chance of a crit (plus a little extra with the \~1% from rolling all 8s), ~~about 4.8%~~ \[edit:  ≈4.3%, thank you u/emarsk\] (very close to the original 5%).

# What this does to your game:

The first and greatest factor is an increase in **player agency**, directly due to the bell curve distribution of rolls. With a normal d20, your +2 or +5 or whatever modifier can very easily be washed out by an unlucky roll. You need a very large modifier to be sure of your ability to tackle larger challenges, which is why games like 5e require so many buffs and bonuses to give players confidence to run their characters. With more consistent, average dice rolls, **your players will develop a more natural intuition of what they can do and expect from their stats**.

However, with the extra swingyness of damage from every d8, **combat becomes more exciting and engaging**, despite most rolls being more consistent. Furthermore, it makes it more **deadly** (read: risky and exciting!) because of the higher overall damage output from both sides. **Martials get a much needed buff** next to their spellcasting counterparts, and spellcasters aren’t as powerless when they run out of spells.

DMs can also **more easily predict and control the difficulty of their encounters** without a string of bad (or very good) luck derailing the fight (as often at least). Also, advantage and disadvantage change both the average and the range, making them much more tactically significant, and affect the amount of maximum extra damage dice you may receive on natural 8s/crits. This all gives DMs more control both when prepping and on the fly.

Lastly, **character progression feels more significant**. With a d20, getting another +1 to a stat moves only the range, but you’re barely more likely to roll a higher roll than you were before because every number in that range is just as likely. By moving the peak of your bell curve, your +1 matters more because those higher DC checks are much more consistent now.

# Preemptive rebuttals:

*Why not 2d10?* The bell curve is stronger with more dice, and crits would become very rare for rolling two 10s, and remove the chances of triple or quadruple damage. (You might find this beneficial and do this instead.)

*Why not 3d6 or 4d6?* I found the crit chances to be far too swingy on d6s, but you might want that and are free to use d6s instead.

*What about my favorite hand carved unicorn horn d20 I sold my car for?* You can still use a d20 for completely random things like initiative or death saves (if using those things). I’ve even been suggested that spellcasters use a d20 to preserve the unpredictability of the arcane.

*Doesn’t adding up more numbers every roll take up more time?* It does, and I’ve noticed the effect to be more extreme for newer players, but you get used to it. I think the benefits are worth the learning (bell) curve (budum tss), and I’ve even introduced this system to people entirely new to ttrpg with little complaint.

*What about \[insert some math knowledge here\], your numbers are wrong!* Look, I’m not here to write a math thesis, I’m here to play ttrpgs with my friends. Regardless of the exact percentages, the feel of my games are changed in a way that works better for how I run them. I’m much more interested in hearing about how you tried it and the effects it had than arguing about math on the internet. I’m sure something I said about the math somewhere was off, I did my best to double check my numbers, but months of playtesting has made me confident in how the game itself is affected and that’s what I’m really posting about. **I welcome polite corrections to my math**, I want them even, but I’ve seen people get very rude over it, so please do so kindly.

Let me know what you think, and best wishes to anyone brave enough to endure my drivel of a write up.

1j4s4z5,Suggest me OSR for solo play.,"I play exclusively solo. I have three ""slots"" for my games.

1. I picked Cairn for my NSR experience. My setting is dark fantasy mixed with sword and sorcery (Conan).

2. I selected various PBTA games (Ironsworn, Winsmore) for my story games. Those are low fantasy.

3. I need a game for a pure OSR experience. I want a ""classic"" fantasy setting.


Can this wonderful community help me decide on a system that would fit slot number three?

I usually play with one character and a sidekick plus hirelings. I use a physical notebook for bullet point notes or more detailed fragments. I also use a tablet for PDFs. I don't use minis, though, as I like portability. 

I wonder how it would feel to play something different from NSR or story games, and I am aiming for a ""full party"" OSR experience in solo mode. I considered Scarlet Heroes, Black Tides, and Just One Torch procedures to play with one character, but I've decided to break my rule of having a single main character to get closer to the original OSR experience. I want to play with a full party (3-4 is right number?). 

I don't like very crunchy systems, but OSRs are quite light in general. I like to have at least a pinch more ""game and structure"" than in CAIRN but I don't want to be buried under bookkeeping demands.
I also considered Shadowdark, but I would pass on this occasion, as I want to achieve a more pure OSR experience. For me, Shadowdark is more of an NSR game, because it blends with some 5e concepts, and I am already playing Cairn in NSR slot. 

I'm not sure if I want something closer to 0D&D or B/X. I think it would mainly be about exploration but not only dungeoneering. I guess I would like to explore a bit of the surface as well. Potentially playing a bit of a campaign would allow me to see how character advancement works in OSR (Cairn has Scars mechanics, but I want something more traditional).

As you probably guessed, I did not play original B/X or 0D&D back in the day, so I don't feel nostalgic about it. I am just curious, and I love the concepts in Principia Apocrypha or the OSR Primer.

QUESTIONS:

1. What game would you suggest I play?

2. Do you think playing with an analog notebook would be doable and pleasant (I love my fountain pen!), or would you suggest jumping on some kind of word processing software like OneNote or Obsidian? It is tempting to copy and paste some fragments and have notes in one tool along with my PDFs; also, tracking light, weight, and ammo is simpler than in an analog method.

3. Bonus question: Can you suggest a setting and some supplements, please? Something that enhances solo OSR play, like additional optional procedures, tools, or collections of random tables that would work with the game you suggest.

Thank you!

I get that it's supposed to reward exploration over combat. I get the example of the (very rare) situation where the PCs go into a dungeon, pilfer a bunch of treasure, and escape without spilling a drop of blood.

But there's an easy way to handle that: just give them xp. I love bonus XP. In fact, in my recent games its the only XP I give out. Completing an adventure provides a fixed amount of xp based on a percentage of what is required for advancing a fighter at the party level, modified by the length and difficulty of the adventure.

1flgq8e,Archaeology proving the obvious: that the original D&D systems ARE part of the OSR,"There is a belief which seems to be widely held here: that the old TSR Dungeons and Dragons systems do NOT technically fall under the umbrella of OSR, because something that is *actually* old school cannot be considered part of an Old School Revival.

I haven't read an osr book yet, but I have skimmed through some quick starts and Kickstart demos. 

When I sit down to *read* them, I just feel lost. 

Here's what I have, please correct me if I'm wrong:

You're usually rolling a d20+mod, aiming higher than a target number. Characters have basically no HP, and are created by rolling on a table. The author's aren't going to make a rule for every situation, the GM is going to make rulings instead. 

Gameplay should be fast. We're not spending time looking up rules. We're going to adjudicate and move on to the storytelling. Kick in the door. Kill the monsters. Loot. Repeat. 

Help?

**Edit** This is awesome. Thank you for the feedback, folks.

Updated understanding: You're not special, you're Indiana Jones instead of Jason Borne (which is not to mention Captain America, who is comparatively off the charts). So this isn't ""heroic fantasy"" as much as it's ""exploring dangerous spaces fantasy."" And at the end of the day, Indy still has a mortgage, so he finds ancient dungeons, sneaks his way through, grabs stuff, says ""this belongs in a museum"" and then sells it to the museum.

1hpd63b,Wondering how these changes would influence my OSE game,"EDIT: Not sure why this post is getting downvoted. I am a newbie to this space asking a genuine question. I appreciate the responses a lot, but find the hostility baffling.


I’m about to start running my first OSE campaign for a school club, and stoked for it. There are three changes I am planning to make that might mess up the balance and wanted to ask what the unintended effects of these might be. For the record I’m planning to start with some old school 1e modules, and build out to a blend of TSR modules, OSR stuff and homebrew. It will be a Greyhawk campaign set in the Dim Forest area.



Change #1 - Partially replacing GP leveling with objective leveling.

I get the rationale behind GP leveling but I have two concerns about it. First, that instead of incentivizing murder hobo behavior it incentivized kleptomania. I want my players to actually form meaningful alliances with NPC factions, not just get their guard down so they can loot their horde. 

Second, it’s just too much math. The reason I’m leaving 5e is because I want less math, not more. 

5e milestone leveling is an outstanding system that disincentivizes combat, but doesn’t work with a non linear OSR type game. Objective leveling does work.

Let’s say I give a flat amount of points for certain objectives. Overcoming (through any means) a random encounter = 100 points. Overcoming a major hostile NPC = 500 points. Clearing an entire adventure module = 1000 points. Something like that. Points received scale up with level.



Change #2 - Removing demihuman level restrictions, EDIT: adding the human racial bonuses included in the OSE Advanced rule book, but keeping class restrictions.

Again, I have two issues with the level restrictions. First, if you hit the level cap it just feels REALLY bad. Second, if you don’t hit the level cap (a more likely scenario), humans remain the weakest race.

The class restrictions are great, though. They give each race identity. The optional rule says that I can remove level and class but not level or class. Therefore removing level restrictions but not class restrictions is going off script. What effect would that have? At a glance it seems to make humans somewhat overpowered while making Half Elves and Half Orcs extremely underpowered.



Change #3 - Removing encumbrance 

Somehow this feels like simultaneously the most controversial and least controversial idea mentioned here. Again, the idea is to cut down on math and maximize playtime. My PCs are played by teenagers who won’t do that math anyway and I damn well won’t do it for them. Getting them to track their rations and roleplay solutions will be hard enough. I do note that encumbrance is an optional rule in OSE but I also know removing any tracked resource from a game like this is a recipe for breaking the game.



TL;DR - I want to use an OSR-ized form of milestone leveling, remove level restrictions but NOT class restrictions, and ignore encumbrance. How badly will this break my game?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b67d8b00>,osr,1735527059.0
1i62dx5,OSR Shift from Advanced to Basic?,"Back when I got connected with the OSR in 2009 or so, it seemed like almost everything was focused on AD&D and its derivatives (e.g. OSRIC). I was mostly on Dragonsfoot back in those days.

I'm just getting back into it after ~12 years of not playing, and it seems like the OSR is very focused on Basic D&D and successors nowadays. When did this change happen? What caused it?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b67f00e0>,osr,1737410385.0
1h6k72e,Rerolling ALL HP at every level?,"I have been playing at a table for about a year where the GM lets you reroll ALL of your HP at every level. This was the first I had ever heard of that rule and I was shocked because this is in an OSR-type of game. And then elsewhere in this sub-Reddit today, I saw people talking about that HP rule as a quality-of-life improvement for OSR games and getting a great deal of support for that view. 

I’m just really surprised because it seems really anti-OSR to me. I thought part of the ethos was that you kind of “get what you get” and make the most of it – plan accordingly knowing that your character has relatively few HP, for example. 

I’m just wondering what some of the general thoughts are on this. 

I guess part of it comes down to how resilient one wants the characters to be and a general sense of “fairness,” but it just seems to go against everything I associate with the OSR and the way I played these games growing up. 

I guess I wouldn’t mind a system that said “we want characters to be more resilient, therefore we will have the following rule in play:” but for that rule NOT to be that you reroll all of the HP every level (if you want). Like maybe, after you level, you reroll a 1 or a 1 or 2 for d6+ hit die classes. I would be more okay with that, than letting a player reroll all HP every level. 

I guess this thing triggered me :-)

UPDATE: r/OnslaughtSix told me that the OD&D table he plays at told him that rerolling HP at every level is “a valid reading of the way it’s phrased in OD&D.” After looking at a PDF of OD&D, he’s right. The rules there just state how many “hit dice” a character gets at each level. And if you look at the language there, and the character charts, it actually looks more like one SHOULD be rerolling them at every level by that rule. 

While I have said a lot about letting dice rolls count and I still would prefer not to have a character go up more than a hit die (+ any bonus) of HP from leveling, I also like tradition and don’t mind unusual things that come out of it. So I am much more comfortable now with these types of rules.

1arugcm,I've never truly enjoyed 5e.my group is tired of wotc but sees themselves playing 5e forever. How do I get them interested in osr?,"I've had some really great times playing 5e over the years, but frankly it was always in spite of the system. I don't enjoy arguing over wordings of rules, or being pigeonholed into a track I can't get off of when I'm tired of it. I've recently been in the process of starting my first campaign as a DM and I've been focusing on all of the under developed aspects of the game. I'm trying to tie gold to xp, and using loot tables for magic items. Many osr systems already have the systems Im basically building from scratch. I'm hoping this game will get them into the idea of building a keep, hiring minions and pursuing their own goals, but how do I get them to switch away from 5e?

How do you deal with this at your tables?,"Today after listening to a podcast about ""taking away the attack roll"", which is a mechanic used in some systems. I was left with a point about this being perhaps motivated by possible solutions to eliminate — I attack, I make a mistake, the opponent attacks and makes a mistake.

I think the normal assumption in OSR play is that you need a free hand to wield a light source so I wanted to see how other DMs ruled this.

I can imagine a few reasons why it wouldn't be common to do this IRL (I believe modern lanterns don't suffer these issues, but medieval lanterns might?):

* Being too close to the body could mess with the air intake, dimming the flame
* The heat generated may be too uncomfortable to stay clipped so close to the body for long
* The contents may slosh around too much, potentially accidentally dousing the flame

If none of the above are enough to outright prevent lanterns from being clipped, I would imagine that there's the possibilities that a fall or solid hit in combat could cause the lantern to shatter and the burning oil to damage the wielder",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b7165b50>,osr,1741722228.0

I'll start out. I have played classic since it was brand new 100 years ago - but it became harder and harder to find players than preferred classic in my region, most play 5th edition sadly. One of my good friends talked me into buying the 5e core books which I did, and I ran 5e games for around 9 months before I just could not take it anymore.

I gave away the 5e books and decided to return to AD&D, which I did but then I discovered Old School Essentials Advanced Fantasy and haven't looked back.

1imw1ix,Torch Dice - a different system for tracking time,"So, I was preparing a session for next week when I stopped to consider the (often overlooked) importance of tracking resource consumption (like torches).

If exploring a dark and dangerous place carefully and accurately takes time, this “time” should be a resource players decide to spend when they feel it is really important.

For example: checking the whole room thoroughly for traps, secret doors or hidden treasures could be “important” to them and they are therefore willing to spend precious time to do so, risking consuming too much of their resources or causing wandering monsters to arrive.

This concept is clear to me - and I imagine it is shared by many in this subreddit.

However, I have never been a fan of bookkeeping caused by this need and have often fallen into the trap of “ok, come on, I will do a rough evaluation”, which however makes the experience less real and less central during the game session.

I tried to think of an alternative. I'm writing this here to gather criticism and opinions (I have a blog on substack but I almost never use it - maybe I should try writing there too?).

# Torch Dice

At the beginning of the expedition, when the characters buy torches or reorganize their inventory, for each torch carried the GM puts 1d6 in the center of the table.

So, if the players carry a total of 10 torches, he will put 10 dice in the center of the table.

When the characters begin the descent into the dungeon, they must declare who is holding a lit torch: they will be called torchbearers. The torchbearers must take an index card place it in front of them and write 0.

# Consuming Torches

Every time the players decide to perform an action that ""costs time"", the torchbearer rolls a torch die and throws it.

If the **result is higher** than the number written on the index card, the player will write the result as the new number on the index card. The first time, since the value is 0, the player rolls the die and writes the result on the index card.

If instead, the **die roll is lower** than the number on their index card, the torch is consumed and the die is discarded. The torch is removed from the character's inventory, then the player writes 0 again on the index card.

**Example actions:**

* Search for traps
* Search for secret doors
* Rest
* Fight (the torch dice roll is made at the end of the fight)
* Walk very slowly down a hall so as not to make noise

# Party splitted

If the party splits, each group must have a torchbearer, and the dice are divided between the groups (according to the carried torches).

In the worst case, where each character is in a different location, each character is a torchbearer and when they perform an action that costs time, they will roll their own dice.

# Pros

The pros I see are that the torches are not consumed with certainty after X turns, but the players still have some elements to know whether the torch is going out or not. If the value on the index card is high, the torch is close to being exhausted. So, it's a little bit more accurate than the usage die.

Also, physically putting dice on the table and saying ""These are your torches"" I think is a very strong and diegetic action.

# Cons

If the players have many torches, many dice are needed.

If the players are divided into many small groups, the risk is that many dice have to be thrown, too often. And this could get annoying after a while.

1j72pjd,How OSR are spell points?,"So, OSR play is very largely about resource management and having spells be just another resource. Vancian magic is a very baked in thing for that, but I feel like enthusiasm for Vancian magic has really waned in the OSR scene. Roll to cast is increasingly used in popular games like DCC and Shadowdark (I believe). I, too, am wondering how necessary or integral Vancian magic is for the OSR experience.

I'm currently interested in the possibilities of a spell point system. What I envision is a pool of spell points that recovers over time, rather than the Vancian way of getting everything back overnight (or rather, by memorizing spells in the morning). You'd probably get a small fixed percentage back per hour. I think the idea is that mages sort of take in ambient energy/magic/whatever and expend it in the form of spells. 

There'd be neat little ways this would work with classes and ability scores, such as a ""Healer"" class casting healing spells for half the spell points but casting offensive spells for double the cost (taken straight from Elder Scrolls: Arena), and high prime requisite spellcasters getting bonus spell points rather than XP progression bonuses.

So, how compatible or incompatible do you think such a system would be with the OSR experience? Classic D&D is all about the ticking clock of resources being expended over the adventuring day, so I could see spell points that gradually recover over time (but not easily refilling) taking away from that. Plus, D&D's lurching progression of skyrocketing in power after getting milestone spells like Fireball would not be a feature of this game. 

I think a benefit of this system would be for spellcasters to not just be out of magic for the entire day. You can always portion it, but if you use it all in a key encounter, you could potentially recover enough for some more minor magic in a few hours. I think there could be interesting resource management aspects to that regarding which spells you cast and when. 

Plus, I think spell creation could be easier and maybe even systemitized if it was point based. 

What do you think? Do you think spell points would add or detract from the OSR experience? Let me know. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b746e9c0>,osr,1741506478.0

1ehfjsx,Hilariously oversized parties,"I'm running Castle Xyntillan. My group is new to OSR. We're running it Swords and Wizardry style, and my players, being canny dudes, quickly realized the utility of hiring henchmen after losing a couple of retainers to animated ovens and beheading traps.

On their latest return to town, they splurged and hired everybody. I'd had fun generating mini profiles and portraits for all potential hires, and the players spent a fraction of their latest haul hiring the max number of henchmen their charisma allowed.

So now they're returning to Castle Xyntillan with about 13 hirelings, whom they've outfitted with all the best armor and gear they could buy.

Which is at once hilarious and feels incredibly unwieldy. This has become a completely different game, with a dozen light and heavy footmen preceding the players into every room. 

How do you guys handle mass-hirings? Just laugh and roll with it?

1ai9v6o,"Are 'Feats' incompatible with the ""Rulings not Rules"" mentality of OSR?","This might be a weird one, so please bear with me.

I love the lighter nature of a lot of OSR rulesets. Games like Knave in particular that want to get out of your way and let you play instead of having you deal with piles of rules that may never come up.

But I feel that older editions lack for meaningful character customization, especially early on. The only meaningful choice you make in BECMI Basic is what Class you want to play, and even that is largely determined by what you rolled for stats (and may completely determine it if your GM does not allow you to swap your highest roll into your prime requisite). As a Magic User, Elf or Cleric above level 1 you choose spells, but otherwise a fighter is a fighter is a fighter, a dwarf is a dwarf is a dwarf.

The #1 thing I hear mentioned when people talk about switching from D&D 5e to a retroclone is how 'fast' character creation is, but that speed is because you're mostly playing a slot machine and receiving a mostly complete character that  you just need to buy equipment for. Depending on your edition you might choose a separate race or class.

I love Feats as a concept, the idea of a sort of floating group of bonuses or features that you can apply to a character to give them a 'special thing'. To use 5e examples: The ability to stop an enemy moving past you with a polearm, the ability to wear armor your class normally can't wear, or a bit of dabbling in spellcasting.

But the problem with Feats is that they necessarily add complexity. If you add a feat allowing a character to stop an enemy from running past them with a polearm, you are implying that a character without this feat is not allowed to do the same thing. It's a big problem that happened with Pathfinder 1e, where they would add a feat that let you do something, and by adding it, they implied (unintentionally or otherwise) that you could no longer do this thing without that feat.

So, to my question: Do you believe 'Feats' as a concept (Or whatever else they might be called) incompatible with the rulings not rules mentality that makes these games so beloved? Or do you think they can coexist? Or do you know they can coexist because you have an example of some OSR-style game that uses them in a way that is not detrimental to the rules?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b769ac60>,osr,1707004134.0

The system’s simplicity and adaptability really shine in long-term play, and the base classes feel solid and well-rounded.

That said, for the sake of discussion, I’d love to explore a “what if” scenario: if you were to expand on the base classes, what would you add? Are there abilities, tweaks, or new mechanics you think would enhance them while staying true to the original design philosophy? For instance, could there be ways to add depth to certain classes without losing their nature?

For example I’ve also come across a number of house rules and hacks that people have implemented in their own games, such as the use of shields (Shields Shall Be Splintered) or giving Fighters additional attacks, or reworking the Thief’s skill system to make it feel less...wonky.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b77688c0>,osr,1737630368.0
173758c,Why is ~25% chance of success ideal/What is the appeal of low odds in OSR games?,"I'm not really an OSR guy, but I've always been fascinated with a lot of games that would be considered part of the OSR. Most of my TTRPG experience is from D&D 3.5/PF/4e/5e so the OSR mindset feels very alien to me.

I've been struggling to wrap my head around one particular element that most OSR-aligned games seem to view as ideal: Roll 15+ to succeed.

The first time I encountered this was in Knave, where the writer very clearly pointed out that the stat rolling system was designed to funnel you toward stats which would require you to roll \~15 on the dice to succeed, but I'm struggling to understand *why* this is ideal.

Because many OSR books revolve around consequences being severe (save or die traps and spells aplenty, very realistic chance of dying from one attack at level 1, etc), the idea of success hinging on a 25% random chance feels like it would cause such a high volume of character death that by the end of a campaign it would be unlikely for any of the original cast to have survived due to anything but sheer luck.

I'm vaguely aware of the idea of playing the game so that you have to roll dice as little as possible, but I also see a lot of OSR modules that have combat as a high focal point, and there doesn't really seem to be a way to win a fight without dice most of the time.

However I have noticed that they are leaving the dungeon very often. They rarely go more than one or two fights or traps before they retreat and go back to town. While this didn't bother me at first it has gotten a bit irritating partially because at least one or two of the players still want to stay and they typically have several people at or near full health. My biggest worry right now is that at the rate things are going my players are never going to take risks and always run away as soon as anyone comes close to death which is rather dull.

Right now I am using random encounters during travel and things like taxes to encourage them to grab more money at once but they have yet to carry more than 10000gp worth of goods in a single run despite having close to 10 people counting hirelings and being at 2nd and 3rd level.

So, of couse, I am going down the OSR rabbit hole, and decided to read one of the most highly praised adventures of all time, The Keep On the Borderlands and I read it from cover to cover.

And... I don't get it.

I know it's a module, supposed to be placed anywhere in my home campaign, it's not supposed to have a story that must be followed and  I must come up with things myself. That's not the problem.

The problem is that **it doesn't have a lot to it**. In the Caves of Chaos, there are some rooms that have nothing but a handful of monsters. There are some cleaver twists here and there that I enjoy, like the orc pretending to be a head mounted on a wall, and goblins that regularly hire an ogre to fight for them. But other than that, it looks like a gallery of monsters with few situations to put my players in.

Also, the **monsters are too numerous**. There are rooms with small armies within them. For a module made for 6 to 9 squishy player characters, they have little chance against the *easiest* of the caves, the Kobold Lair. The ambush at the entrance might just be enough to wipe half of them before they can scape. Let alone the common chamber, with 30 Kobolds. It doesn't mean I want every room to be beatable, but the only smart thing they can do when they stumble up it, is run away.

If I played it when I was 12 yo, maybe I would remember it fondly.

Something simple that I can just run at the drop of the hat if need be with no other development then that... what could go wrong?

Well one of my players decided to read the entire list of things they could buy and saw that you could buy a cow for 10 SP. He asked if the cow would be a dairy cow, and I said yes not really thinking much of the question. Then the party decided they wanted to spend all the silver they have on buying cows, farmland, and pay for farmers to manage the cows and becoming rich selling the milk. Keep in mind I haven't even decided what setting this mini campaign takes place in I have literally just prepared the town and a few levels of the dungeon.

A few google searches later (and a lot of of sighs and face holding by myself) I decide on that a cow can produce 20 gallons of milk a week and each gallon is worth 3 SP a gallon. This is based on some very basic numbers I saw online (knowing nothing about dairy farming myself) and figuring 1 gallon of milk being worth triple a gallon of water made sense.

**Actual Question**: Not being someone who wants to railroad my players (and while I may have played up my frustration I am actually kind of curious where this could go) I have zero idea how to turn this into a ongoing campaign. Some ideas I had were things like securing the amount of cows they would want, dealing with ""rival"" dairy farms, and figuring out where and how they are going to sell their goods. I would love some input from the community however on how I can turn this into a fun and engaging experience!

First, while this definitely wasn't the idea I had for a ""backup"" game, I love it when players try and make a campaign their own thing even if its not something I would have ever thought they wanted to do! While I'll definitely make some changes to the margin on the cows, you've all given me ideas on how to challenge the players in their production of milk so it isn't just a get rich quick scheme!

Second, to the people concerned about my personal enjoyment of the game thanks for your concern! If this was something I had 0 interest in running I would absolutely either just put a stop to it, or have Drag'oon, Devourer of Cows swoop in and eat up their livestock! The idea of having the players want to run a business/farm is just something I haven't really encountered before and was curious how other people ran these type of ventures.

fortune roll from blades in the dark instead of normal x in 6 chances. It makes the odds of the random chance a little more obscured than linear odds, which I like more.

Lastly, very minor thing which is technically inspired by an OSR product (DCC) - I really like PCs having some kind of ""stars you were born under"" thing.

I know I prefer the thief and fighter in LotFP, so am unsure what I get beyond a somewhat nicer layout with more mainstream-friendly art. Is there more to it?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b7a84f80>,osr,1707688337.0
1fhiuq2,How can I handle slaves (as retainers)?,"PLEASE READ THE EDIT BELOW

Foreword: we play *Old School Essentials* and use standard gold coins.

In my setting, slaves are legal and can be purchased.

One of my player asked if they can purchase a slave (or more) and bring them to dungeons. I said: ""Yeah, I mean there is a market for it"" but then I realised that it may be too good. (EDIT: they will be Chaotic if they want to support the slavers.)

The solution I have in mind is that classed slaves have a high upfront cost (maybe 100-200 gold? Or more?) but then you can bring them on adventure and they will fight. There will still be Loyalty Checks (attempt to flee on the first chance on a fail) and they will count towards share of XP like a normal henchman, but they won't get any treasure.

What about weaker slaves that don't fight (like torchbearers)?

Do you think it can work? How would you balance them?

**EDIT**

Reading the replies, a lot of people think this is a troll post or that I am a troll. Sorry if I sounded like that in the post (English is not really my thing).

I mean, I know it can be a though topic to deal with.

I play only with close friends, we are all adults and we discussed this in Session 0: I was ready to drop the theme if any of the players were unconfortable with it. They were okay with it.

We have a lot of media in which slaves are a thing, or a serious matter. *Morrowind,* to name one, which my setting is inspired to. There is a faction which handles the slaves market, and there is a faction that is trying to stop it and remove this inhuman matter from the culture.

One interesting takeaway I got from the replies: if they want to support the slavers, they are going to be Chaotic alignment. They have a Good Cleric in the party, so this should raise some eyebrows.

For the rest, please keep to the topic. I think it can be an interesting matter to discuss, be it be slaves, robots, automations or whatever. (What I mean here is that they don't act as standard retainers because they don't need to be paid for their ""work"". NOT the ethics behind it).

**EDIT 2:** when I wrote ""Yeah, I mean there is a market for it"" I didn't mean that it is a good thing or that I expected it. However, I give players total agency, so if they want to go through this path, sure.

The first step was to understand how it works mechanically (the reason I made this post), then I would have thought of consequences for their decision to support the slave market.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b7ac4fb0>,osr,1726423368.0
1gv6i0r,Favorite Initiative Systems ,"I have come to love side based initiative. Before using it I thought that it might get too confusing with all the players talking and trying to get their action in. But in actual play (with 4 players at least) it goes so smoothly and no one gets confused about who has done what or anything.

There are two things really pushed me over the edge to use side based initiative.

First, is that it is either the players turn, or the enemies turn. Both of which are important to the party and each individual player. There isn't really a time the players can afford to not pay attention.

Second, is that it easily allows for teamwork and coordinated/tandem tactics. If you want to lift a character up so they can climb on to a chandelier, you can both just do it when you act. No waiting around or fiddling with initiative to make it work.

One bonus reason I love it (which is the reason I considered it in the first place) is the seamless transition. One die roll and you're done, everyone knows everything they need to know about the initiative from that one roll.

All of these points come together perfectly in my opinion. I know it is nothing original or groundbreaking, but I really enjoy this initiative system and used it in my own system [Embark](https://infinite-fractal.itch.io/embark).

1gfjs07,"How to handle ""betrayal"" hungry players?","Hi, im going to DM labyrinth lord/becmi soon

Lets say one of your players, after interacting with a regular NPC, maybe even after helping them, enjoys turning on them and trying to kill them.

For example: You find a lone adventurer out in the wildernes and join him for lunch. All is good and well. After saying good bye to him, one of your players decides to (in the blink of an eye) murder him. Coldblood, just to get his (worthless) loot. How would you handle this? Let them kill the npc or does the NPC notice and a regular fight occurs?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b7b29c40>,osr,1730285916.0

1eimutx,Can you actually turn 5e into an OSR game?,"As I've looked into the OSR, I've heard people make this claim, and I'm curious as to the validity. The biggest hinderance for me becoming a total OSR bro is the classic OSR mechanics (TSR games and spinoffs). They're just a bit alien to me because I'm accustomed to 5e (not because of any inherent gaping problem with them).

It seems to me that there are some hard-coded things about 5e that are incompatible with OSR play. The skills and CHA system for social interaction, for example, pretty much outright places mechanical performance way over roleplay (and if you invert that as a DM, I think most CHA maximizing players would be affronted). Also, the ""action economy"" results in very videogamey and combo-centric play (""how can I maximize my bonus action"" instead of ""I'll shoot him with my arrow""). And the fact that 5e character power has a much larger basis in your stats than is the case for TSR games.

Other elements, such as low lethality and the overprioritization of ""character building"" seem more malleable to me (remove death saves, feats, multiclassing, etc.)

I'm curious to see if anyone has had success running 5e as an OSR game, and what you had to do to do so. 

And I do like a lot about 5e (otherwise, I wouldn't ask). I like the streamlined d20 mechanics, at least half of the skill system, the huge spell list, the giant monster manual, the community work, etc.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b7bc1100>,osr,1722636815.0
