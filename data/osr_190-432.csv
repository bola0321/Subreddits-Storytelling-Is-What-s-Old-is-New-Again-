[Review] Old School Essentials,"I wrote up an [exhaustive review and analysis](https://rancourt.substack.com/p/review-old-school-essentials) of OSE and, by proxy, BX.

5e only players reviewing Original or OSR is weird.,"Note: This is not a bash of 5e. This is not a bash of 5e players. This is an observation of the odd choices of words 5e player who review or talk about classic D&amp;D and retroclones use to talk about them.

I’m watching a 5e player review OSE on YouTube. While the review is very positive and they enjoyed the game, some of the descriptions are just weird. They remind me of some podcasts of 5e players trying B/X and what they said, which was quite negative.

I mean, there are plenty of modern RPGs that are rules light (even if only player facing) and plenty that have very simple character sheets. Yet, when talking about a classic D&amp;D or retroclone’s character sheet, at best the simplicity needs to talked about in an oddly patronizing way that assumes more is better.

This ignorance that there are other games from the 70s and early 80s that are mostly unchanged and still played is often also shown. 

The other thing that always seems weird is that need to simplify the math for modern sensibilities. Do they not know Call of Cthulhu is likely the number two RPG and the latest edition makes you multiply and divid. The insanity of it. While 5e players talking about a classic D&amp;D rule set having subtraction.

Thing is. Most 5e players have only played 5e and seem unaware the come to the table of any other editions or TTRPG with a ton of biases. 

Original to B/X to OSR are as different to 5e as are most other RPGs to 5e. Rather than talking about early editions as quaint, it would be better to look at them as something completely new.

Edit: some people are missing the point above. It is great that 5e YouTubers and podcasters are checking out OSR. They just say the weirdest things, not wrong, not inaccurate, just odd. Partly due to their single point of reference. Partly due to not wanting to compare in a way that comes across as the smallest slight to 5e, forcing some weird backhanded compliments.

Edit 2: there was a video that brought about this post, but I didn’t link it it as my original intent was not call put this YouTuber or the video in particular, but mention a more generalized observation. The video is good and glad someone else added the link. The presenter did a great job too, and as some have pointed out the choice of words is all about the audience they are speaking to, causing the almost “this is good” while also apologetic. One more time, the presenter was awesome, glad they did this video and glad they enjoy OSE. 

Also glad to see the comments on that video are super positive (the ones I saw anyway). Mostly gentle mentions that OSE is B/X and that OSR can support narrative gaming.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1212e20f0>,osr,1648486377.0

Adventure Review: Operation Unfathomable,"I just finished this adventure with my group yesterday and it was loads of fun! Before we played I didn't ever find that many reviews of it online so I decided to write one up to put out there into space. I put it on [my blog thing](https://shining-skull.tumblr.com/post/773704572724281344/adventure-review-operation-unfathomable) and I'll post all the words here, too.

EDIT: Typos, so many typos

*Too long; Don't wanna read? It's super fun and great and I recommend it.*

# ADVENTURE REVIEW: OPERATION UNFATHOMABLE

**Author/Publisher:** Jason Sholtis/Hydra Cooperative

**System:** Swords & Wizardry

**Level Range:** 1-2? Or maybe a bit higher? Nothing is balanced anyways.

# THE PITCH

You and your party are press-ganged into searching for a lost prince of an evil empire who has run off into the underworld with a powerful magical artifact seeking glory. You’ll follow his trail into the chaotic underdark to retrieve the artifact and hopefully earn your freedom.  

# CONTEXT

I bought this years ago and it’s been sitting on my shelf forever. My group just finished our Tunnel Goons campaign “Retro Rascals” and we weren’t ready to go back to straight up ‘vanilla fantasy’ yet. So, as a transition we finally busted out Operation Unfathomable. Was played at my kitchen table using a heavily house ruled OSE. It took us four sessions of about 3-4 hours each to finish. Shorter than expected but in a good way!

# PREP TIME

I’ve had this book on my shelf and read it in bits and pieces a lot over the last few years without having played it. The book is well-organized for at-the-table reference, with separate sections for random events, location descriptions, bestiary, magic items, etc. 

The process for rolling random encounters is more complex than a lot of modules. The book contains 44 detailed random encounters divided into separate tables for “Underworld Phenomena”, “Competing Parties & Underworld Travelers”, and “Wandering Horrors.” This is a GOOD thing because the encounters are richly-described and contain loads of world-building and gonzo experiences for players. But, I found it best if I pre-rolled a bunch of encounters before we came together at the table since it required a couple of rolls and a fair bit of reading and flipping to sort out what was happening. If I rolled and read the encounters in advance it made things flow much more smoothly at the table. 

The map is interesting and has icons built into it to indicate common environmental things like piles of debris and fungus gardens that have their own tables and procedures attached to them. I found it easy to describe the size of caves and general details to players so that they could navigate. The location descriptions are similarly fun and gonzo but can be wordy. It’s usually something I don’t like but it was worth it in the case of Operation Unfathomable because the locations and happenings were so gonzo and creative!

# AT THE TABLE

From the start this adventure grabs hold of you and pulls you in with crazy sights, ridiculous creatures, compelling side quests, and deadly encounters! I’ve never played such a bonkers but ultimately coherent and well-conceived dungeon.

It’s a bit wordy and that can slow things down sometimes but it’s absolutely worth the time you’ll take to read ahead and prepare.

Players were constantly engaged with interesting risks and weird and interesting situations. They knew enough to hide or run for their lives from some of the incredibly dangerous wandering monsters. Pushing buttons resulted in enough positive and cool outcomes early on that they were keen to experiment and take risks. 

The dungeon map has loads of different ways to travel around, lots of loops, and useful landmarks for players to orient themselves. I printed the way simplified player map that comes with the book and it was useful to get the players started on their exploration. I bookmarked the GM map in the book and it was very useful and well-labeled. 

The book is organized in a very effective way so you can flip through at the table and find what you need pretty easily. The pictures and artwork in the book are phenomenal and hilarious: you’ll want to show them to your players to set the tone and have a laugh together!

# OLD SCHOOL VIBES

Operation Unfathomable definitely brings the Old School vibes. Players are immediately thrust into action way over their heads and the pressure stays on. Even though the situations are unbalanced and seemingly unfair, players get a hold of a lot of powerful magic items and tools that they can use to more than even the odds: even for a party of first level players! 

Not all the encounters are combat-related! In fact, more than often players will have the chance to talk their way out of trouble or just have interesting and fun interactions with the denizens and visitors to the underworld that they will meet. 

The setting is the best-realized gonzo-style old school that I’ve played. Law & Chaos factor in as concepts (but not in any high-falootin’ way); psychic mushroom scientists offer mutation inducing fungus spores for players to experiment with; time-travelling humanoid animals seek to prevent the future apocalypse; and a cult of headless remote-controlled worshippers form a political alliance with a 50-foot long chaos godling worm. This barely scratches the surface of the insanity this module contains. But it somehow ‘makes sense’ in the context of the setting. It’s special.

# TREASURE AND LOOT

I don’t recommend inserting this module into an existing campaign: there’s a good chance that the magic items and loot that your players will find will be game-breaking in your normal campaign.

At the start of the mission players are provided with a stockpile of scrolls, exploding swords, amulets and other magic items to assist them in their quest. As the adventures unfold the party will have access to powerful magic items. In the context of Operation Unfathomable this is a strong positive: the magic items help to balance the scale and give players the chance to actually survive and impact the environment. In addition to physical items, there are loads of opportunities for characters to mutate themselves to gain interesting and OP special abilities and attacks. 

The exploding Sword of Demolition +1 was instrumental in ‘softening up’ a chaos godling when it was used as a suppository. Later, the godling was ultimately defeated when the Wooly Nelson, the Wooly Neanderthal player character, climbed into the worm sultan’s behind and used his newfound fungus-induced ability to explode into magical blue flame to finish the job.

WARNING! Early in one of the first sessions my players encountered science fungoids who repaid the party with Antipersonnel Puffball Fungi as a reward for being guinea pigs in their mutating experiments. This wasn’t without risk: one of the PCs erupted with spores and died immediately. However,  in hindsight I handed out too many (just enough?) of the Antipersonnel mushrooms as a reward. The players used these to massively turn the tide in numerous encounters with overwhelming numbers of baddies. They are very powerful and maybe should be handed out sparingly.

# MONSTERS AND FACTIONS

I don’t think there are any vanilla monsters in this entire module! Every encounter, every NPC, every wandering monster is unique to the setting and the majority are unique in each pre-designed encounter. The sheer overwhelming creativity that Jason Sholtis unleashes in this adventure is unbelievable. There are very few other modules that cram so much creativity and gonzo bliss into so few pages. To me, this is singular Old School D&D genius. 

You’ve got noble hybrid animal-fungi creatures from an alternate dimension called Blind Antler Men; headless remote controlled cultists of Null; slugman merchants; worm soldiers, an infant chaos godling named Thrantrix the Ineffable whose body is made of millions of writhing snakes, an immortal red-furred giant grieving its lost mate, mind bats, segmented giant underworld janitors, ancient beetle ghosts, and more . . . so much more.

# TRAPS AND PUZZLES

Finding the lost prince and the magical artifact proved a fun challenge. His shenanigans left a trail of corpses that the players were able to follow for a distance and many of the encounters with underworld NPCs provided additional clues and breadcrumbs. The map didn’t have any traps of the traditional variety. However, there are loads of buttons to push, mushrooms to munch, and risk-reward scenarios for players to monkey around with that can provide fantastic and powerful boons or crippling or fatal outcomes for the players. 

At the end of the module my surviving player characters were forever changed! One turned into a humanoid mushroom with telepathic communication abilities. Another had his eyes turn golden and gained the ability to detect good/evil and magic at will. One PC and many NPC retainers met all kinds of hilarious and horrible ends as they experimented with the flora, fauna, and artifacts they discovered. 

# GM CHALLENGES

Like I mentioned earlier, the drawback to having well-detailed and interesting encounters is that there is a lot to read before you can get rolling with some of them. Most sessions I rolled in advance to select the encounters so I’d be better aware of what was going to happen. The session I didn’t I felt rushed and having to read first then describe to players slowed things down. No one complained, but it was harder for me. 

Other than that, the module is really easy to play and run. The encounters are absolutely mental, so you need to think on your feet sometimes and make stuff up on the fly, but the gonzo-tone of the adventure makes you feel comfortable doing it: it’s too wacky for you to worry much about breaking anything. For example, after obtaining the Null Rod – the MacGuffin artifact and anti-chaos mega-weapon –  the party visited the mouth of the Oracle of the Bottomless Pit. Teaming up with Dr. Thorontius (humanoid bear cosmology professor from the future) the team decided to destroy the Null Rod to prevent his rival and nemesis from using it to alter the space time continuum to create a robot apocalypse in the future. They asked the Oracle if tossing the Null Rod in his mouth (a bottomless pit) would destroy it. 

 . . . that’s not an answer the module provides!

I decided that since the center of the earth is a source of raw Chaos the Null Rod would eventually nullify all the Chaos there, ultimately upsetting the balance between Law and Chaos that sustains our reality and slowly but surely destroying the world. He then gave a hint to a Chaos Battery (found in Odious Uplands, the sequel to Operation Unfathomable and our next adventure!) that could reverse the polarity of the Null Rod and render it vulnerable to physical destruction. 

Well, you decide for yourself if that was a good ruling or not. My players bought it and I found a link to our next module. If you could handle that level of ad-lib then this module will be easy for you.

# PARTY OUTCOME

There aren’t many reviews of Operation Unfathomable online, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. My players entered the underworld with 3 level one PCs: Fartwolf the Fighter, Wooly Nelson the Wooly Neanderthal (a class unique to this module), and Eggy Weiner the Thief. In the first session, Eggy experimented with science fungoid spores and turned into a humanoid mushroom man. We used the stats of the Mycelian from Carcass Crawler #3. However, he got captured in a failed raid on the throne room of Shaggath-Ka, the local Chaos Godling, and the player rolled up a new character: Dorox Thundershield the Blue Dwarf who soon got a fungal brain infection and had his intelligence reduced significantly. Don’t eat strange mushrooms, kids!!

In the second session the party discovered and defeated Shaggath-Ka the Worm Sultan with the help of Antipersonnel Puffballs, a motley crew of suicide mission-sworn retired Paladins, and a host of weird magical abilities and mutations they had gained.  Big win and unexpected! Amazing what exploding neanderthal enemas can accomplish! His conniving worm-son, Shaggankh, was grateful to the party for expediting his father’s demise and his coronation as worm sultan and allowed them to leave with their lives as a reward.

In session three the party continued their search for the Null Rod or some evidence of the absent prince’s whereabouts. They explored deep into the map and discovered a lot of the lore and history of the underworld. They also met some interesting NPCs, had a bunch of battles and whittled away at their supply of retainers and magic items. 

In the fourth and final session the party found the corpse of the lost prince, retrieved the Null Rod from a micro-sized civilization of Nanuits living in a frozen cave and beat a fast retreat to the surface. Some very lucky rolls and their remaining Antipersonnel Puffballs made handy work of the small Imperial strikeforce awaiting their return at the surface and the Citizen Lich Sorcerer leading the brigade who had designs to take the party prisoner and steal the rod back for the Empire. 

The players are now free and clear in the untamed wilds of Upper Mastadonia and ready to begin exploring the hexcrawl sequel to Operation Unfathomable – The Odious Uplands! 

It’s worth noting that they are mostly almost at 3rd level now. There is not a lot of gold and riches to plunder in the underworld. I gave 500 bonus milestone XP when they killed the Chaos Godling and when they completed the module to compensate and celebrate those pretty cool achievements. That may be sacrilegious to some so know that there’s not a lot to support leveling up if you’re strictly XP for Gold style. 

I expected this adventure to take way longer than it did. However, I’m really happy with how it went and glad that the players made it through so much wacky content in our four, three-and-a-half hour sessions. Very successful!

# FINAL THOUGHTS

I’m so happy we played this. It’s goofy and fun and full of amazing memorable encounters. It’s a pretty beefy module with a lot of words and amazing artwork that you’ll be absolutely dying to share with your players when they encounter some new transdimensional monstrosity. It’s not as easy as some of the OSE-style dungeon modules to run but it’s worth the extra effort to read & roll ahead. We are all super-excited to continue with the setting in Jason Sholtis's follow-up setting/module Odious Uplands!

*NOTE: We used the DCC module “Frozen in Time” as a funnel before playing Operation Unfathomable and it was a pitch perfect match in terms of tropes and themes. Definitely recommended: it’s a really good module itself and the text-heavy DCC module experience kinda prepared me to run Operation Unfathomable right after.

His Majesty the Worm - Playtest Review,"Hello everyone!

Yesterday three of my players and I opted to run the ""Tutorial Dungeon"" provided in His Majesty The Worm and it was an absolute blast! I will break down my experiences and thoughts. Please understand that I won't explain all the rules here, there is so much unique stuff and so many interactions to explain it all - the post is long enough as it is. So, I fear you have to know the system a bit to get all my points.

DUNGEON: The dungeon is super cool, includes a lot of neat ideas, conflict, and many opportunities for roleplaying. I don't want to spoil it. Just run it and see for yourself!
Also, big props for how the dungeon and room descriptions are layed out. It was super easy to run it, even after only skimming it once.

GAME: Character creation takes quite a lot of time the first time around (3 players, online, 1.5h) and the combat mechanics are VERY different than the other games we've played. That being said, the characters and their abilities are super flavorful. I really like that you can spend XP on the fly to use untrained talents. There was never a situation where not at least one character could do something useful. 
Camp actions are great. Reminded me a lot of Darkest Dungeon. You can get cool buffs for your group, research, etc. It interacts neatly with the Bond mechanic, which really encourages teamwork and roleplay imo.

COMBAT: It might take 1-2 combats to ""get it""  but after that things get rollin. Combat is very tactical, fast and interactive. You draw hands of tarot cards and can play them on your turn, and the turns of other combatants to act. The main action and minor action (acting on someone else's turn) setup leads to super dynamic and cinematic combat where you have almost no downtime. I also like the idea of your initiative being your defense and the many ways how you can change it on the fly.

UNSURE: 
1. I think some of the character abilities are quite strong and a get free out of jail card in many circumstances. I am interested how it feels for long proper campaigns when character start to master more talents (the in-training mechanic keeps them in check for the first few sessions).
2. The enemies we've encountered didn't really feel like a threat - this of course might be caused by playing the starter dungeon. We also were not able to finish the whole dungeon in one session, so they have not yet met all the dangers lurking down there. Just glancing at it though characters have quite a few ways to negate damage (conditions, wounding talents, notching armor, etc), and most enemies only deal 1 damage.
3. I usually play with groups for 4-7 players. I think in groups that large (speak: with that much inventory space), the light mechanic will not add much to the drama, but be more of annoyence. Each light source has a number of times it can flicker (caused by various events) before it goes out. Larger groups will be able to carry so many light sources, rations and tools, that I don't know how effective the threat of dwindling light will be. Have to see that.

Alright, for everyone still reading my mad ramblings: our test session of HMTW was great, the mechanics and rules flow in a unique way and I am looking forward to running it again.

Q: How to enroll play testers and reviewers for an original OD&D campaign/world,"Hey everyone,

TL/DR: What started as a one-shot campaign idea has now spread to:  


* 10 major locations.
* 30 maps (towns, buildings, dungeons, now being professionally rendered).
* 90 NPCs (though many are just a single line of text and not plot critical)- Dozens of side quests.
* 6 exemplar PCs (that right now I'm just using for artwork).
* Includes town, wilderness, and dungeon adventures.
* Could easily end up being...dunno...8 modules? Hard to say w/o people playtesting it. There is certainly room to keep expanding it (I have to locations not yet written).

Woof!  This is all done using the AD&D books (excluding FF & MM2) because...well I'm old. :-p

Premise:  The party has been given a quest to recover a holy relic that was stolen and taken into the ""mouse world"". In order to recover it the party will need to transform into mice versions of themselves and explore the Lake District (what I'm calling it for now).  Essentially it started as ""wouldn't it be cool to play DnD as mice versions of PCs"" (think Redwall, MouseGuard, etc.)

My problem(s) I'd like advice on are:

1. Play testing: Getting people to review what I've created prior to publishing. I've stopped writing new content and am focusing on editing what I have already, and am doing my best to ensure it all makes sense and is balanced, but until people actually \*play\* it, how do you know?
2. Publishing: Never done anything like this and am still reading through it.  Yes, I can read blogs, articles, etc. but it would be great to actually speak to someone directly who has done this, e.g. an original setting, original art, etc.    Does anyone know someone who has this done before and would be open to mentoring a newbie?

FAQ

1. Yes, at some point it will need to be able to be played in 5e if I really want to get to a broader audience. I played 5e once and it wasn't my thing, so would have to partner with someone to make this happen (likely a supplement?)
2. Personally I think there is a lot of potential to keep adding more adventures, so will keep writing as tbh it's a lot of run.
3. Yes, you could ditch the mouse concept entirely without much fuss if it's not your thing, as nearly every animal is mapped to an OD&D MM analog.
4. I avoided FF & MM2 and UA for simplicity's sake, as not everyone uses those materials, but it would be easy enough to include material from them.  


Thanks so much for all the comments - you guys are great! :)  I've already started to fold the ideas in.

NOTE: Edited for formatting after a second cup of coffee.  
NOTE: Edited to cite ADnD vs. ODnD (my bad). Added 4th FAQ.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x121335460>,osr,1710945731.0
Adventure Review: Secret of the Black Crag,"Hi all! I had some extra time this holiday season and wanted to make a review of ""Secret of the Black Crag."" My group played the hell out of this module for almost a year so I thought it would be good to close the book on it by getting some thoughts down. I put it on [my tumbler place](https://shining-skull.tumblr.com/post/770714824162279424/adventure-review-secret-of-the-black-crag) and I'll put the text in here too. Hopefully it's of some use to anyone considering the module!

**AUTHOR/PUBLISHER:** *Chance Dudinack*  
**SYSTEM:** *Old School Essentials*  
**LEVEL RANGE:** *1-5*

# THE PITCH

*A strange and legendary mountain has emerged from the depths of the sea. Strange fish-people are attacking ships and waylaying travelers. The pirate shanty-town of Port Fortune is where your quest to uncover the secrets of the Black Crag begins.*

# CONTEXT

I backed this Kickstarter many moons ago when I saw that it was being written by Chance Dudinack. I played and loved his ‘Black Wyrm of Brandonsford” many times and knew that this would be a winner. 

We spent the better part of a year playing this in-person weekly or bi-weekly with one GM and two PCs. Lots of retainers died in the making of this review.

# PREP TIME

I read the book one time from front to back over the course of a couple of hours. It’s not that long.

I strongly recommend reading the section at the front of the book about the history and background of the Black Crag: once the party enters that final dungeon it will help the GM a lot to know what the goals of the different factions are. 

Understanding and/or deciding the relationships between Red Rathbone (mayor of Port Fortune), the Sea Hag, the Merfolk, and the Tatunca villagers ahead of time would benefit the GM in the long haul.

Awesomely, the book contains all the content needed to manage ocean travel so it was a great quick reference during play. I still needed the OSE rule book to look up some spells for my players but most of the adventure content is found in the book, including monster & ship stat blocks and magic item effects. 

There are plenty of random tables to roll on if you want to ‘prep as you play’. There are fantastic resources for creating fun and flavorful NPCs on the fly and some very useful pre-made pirate ships & crews that came in super handy. 

NPCs are unique and all have enough ‘personality’ to make them stand out against each other and be easy to roleplay for the GM without having to remember too much. Likewise, the relationships and goals of factions and NPCs are described well and simple enough to run without getting bogged down or needing to cross reference anything.

Take note: some of the labels on the downloadable content don’t match the numbers and letters in the book. This was my one gripe that made things clunky sometimes at the table. Absolutely not a deal-breaker though! Just a smudge on an otherwise fantastic experience.

Overall, this was very easy to run “seat of the pants” and I was super-impressed by the clear layout and ‘just enough’ descriptions. I never planned ahead for a single session and we had a fantastic time.

# AT THE TABLE

My party hadn’t played a pirate/nautical themed adventure so this was an eye-opener. After their first day at Port Fortune they attempted to sail the seas in a tiny dinghy. They got lost and a random table had them stuck on a sandbar after their boat was struck by lightning and capsized. The ocean became a ‘faction’ on its own at that point. 

At sunrise, a legendary Great White Shark began circling. The fighter managed to harpoon a makeshift raft to it and leap on its back and steer the beast to the closest island. 

The different islands provided loads of exciting themed experiences. There were giant birds, strange glowing space-eggs, cave monsters, monkey temples and all the fun stuff you’d hope for. Session-to-session the party would just decide what unexplored place to visit or stop by on the way to the place they were heading and they’d often find more than they’d bargained for. 

# OLD SCHOOL VIBES

Black Crag is packed with interesting factions and relationships. Much like Chance Dudinacks other adventure “The Black Worm of Brandonsford,” there are loads of relationships and connections between locations and NPCs built into the game that lead players to make interesting and world-impacting decisions. 

They developed interesting ad-hoc relationships with the different factions and were able to come up with their own interesting goals and designs. As the adventure progressed they promised vengeance against the captain of an imperial treasure barge, Lord Duke Baron, who had embarrassed them early in the adventure. One player, after being mutated during a magical pact to gain water breathing abilities, decided to woo the Queen of the Mermaids. Not surprisingly, the party started collecting ships and trying to make their own fleet.  It was pretty epic.

Exploration is a big part of the game. The map of the Salamander Islands was very useful. I printed out an 11x17 size copy of it for the players and they traced their travels and made notes on it using a red pen. It was a useful tool, fun prop, and a great keepsake of the adventure! It provided the chance for meaningful and engaging overland exploration in addition to dungeon delves.

Dungeons have lots of different paths through and there’s often more than one way to solve a problem or make it across a trap. Magical crystals can be found at different places across the map that can be used in multiple dungeon locations so sometimes it’s worth it to revisit a dungeon to use a crystal you’ve found to access a new area. Likewise, some areas in dungeons are flooded and require water-breathing to make meaningful progress through. Accessing potions of water-breathing and longer term solutions became a goal of it’s own in our campaign.

Encounters are definitely not balanced: the party got in hot water a few times and loads of retainers were slaughtered. We ran with lots of retainers from the pirate crews and the cost to convince them to join skyrocketed as word spread of how much of a death sentence it was to be a retainer for the party.

There’s an awesome classic flavor to this adventure with just enough creativity to make it fresh. Giant statue guardians, enormous fauna, volcanoes, strange progenitor races, and the like all make for a super-fun old school vibe. Black Crag doesn’t ever reach ‘gonzo’ levels of weirdness but there’s just enough strange in there to keep things interesting, mysterious, and fun. 

# TREASURE AND LOOT

The best treasure was always finding another ship to add to the fleet. 

The loot varied from low-key player-creative stuff like a voice-recording mechanical parrot, to utility items like a conch shell that creates air bubbles for underwater exploration, to magical swords and tridents. There are scads of pirate loot to collect and my players went from Level 1 to Level 5 pretty easily by looting hordes and treasure ships full of gold bars, coins, and other trade goods like casks of whiskey, etc.

The most impactful treasure was a water producing sea-dragon’s pearl that was used to flood a barricaded temple and commit monkey genocide to prevent the rise of an intelligent simian empire.

All that said, the loot may be the weakest part of the module. Nothing made the players stand up and shout. I added in some homebrew items that made use of the gems that I knew the players would enjoy to compensate.

# MONSTERS AND FACTIONS

There are lots of unique monsters to this module. Standouts for our adventure were a giant, two-headed roc, the named megalodon shark, intelligent monkeys, precursor beings, and the sea dragon. 

# TRAPS AND PUZZLES

Most of the puzzles and traps rely on player’s accessing magical gems to proceed. This can make things a bit simple sometimes but it’s also good because players rarely got stumped by puzzles they couldn’t solve. The traps had pretty simple solutions in most cases which I think is good. It gave players pause for thought without frustrating them entirely. I wouldn’t say that this module is characterized by complex or intriguing puzzles though.

# GM CHALLENGES

As a GM, I needed to get savvy with ship-based combat and ocean travel rules, which I had not used before. Thankfully, all the info I needed was in the Black Crag book so quick reference was easy. 

Managing crew-vs-crew combat was also something new for me. I wound up buying some cubes of Chessex mini-d6’s and houseruling group combat basically using the rules from RISK. It worked and was still fun!

Some of the events that could occur were game-changing and led to end-game scenarios that exceeded the scope of the book to describe and run. The final session required a bit of prep on my part to prepare. The map significantly changed and technologies that were not present before came into play. However, we ran this campaign for the better part of a year and the only prep I needed to do was for the finale, so I think that’s fair.

Once more, some of the map labels didn’t match the book which made at-the-table reference a pain sometimes. However, the book is pretty slim and I was still able to cope. Not a deal-breaker. 

# PARTY OUTCOME

Our party ultimately succeeded in solving the mystery of the Black Crag and becoming the most notorious pirates in the Salamander Archipelago. Two main characters became wedded to local royalty, one was unrecognizable after being blinded, mutated, and losing his true name in ill-fated bargains with a sea witch. 

We ended with a bit of a cliffhanger as one of the possible ‘big bads’ in the adventure became empowered through the PC’s actions. We may revisit it as a one-shot to have a final battle! 

# FINAL THOUGHTS

This campaign is one of the best I’ve ever run as a self-contained module. We got almost a year of weekly or bi-weekly gaming out of it and I pretty much never had to prep anything, so that’s a massive win. If you are looking for a pirate-themed campaign this rings the bell. The scope is big enough for exploration and fun but contained enough to be manageable and have interesting domino effects occur. 

Players really got into watching their characters mutate and evolve, designed their own ‘jolly roger’ flags and named their ships, and grew their influence and renown as pirates. The campaign never got dull and always felt fun and exciting.

"Mothership Review, OSR with Newbies, and Running and re-writing a module on the fly","Last week, I ran Mothership TTRPG for the first time, for a group of friends who have never played Mothership, have little (no?) experience with OSR-style gaming, and many of us had not played a ttrpg together. New rules, new people, new play style. You’d think this would be a recipe for a bad time, but we had a blast. Mothership sells itself as a spooky, deadly sci-fi horror game and it delivered.

This isn’t a a review per se, but a mish-mash of reflection-review-pondering. I want to document some of the pro’s and cons of my experience as a Warden, as well as some commentary on the game, OSR, and module. 

**Prep:** 

In preparing to run the game, I read through the Player’s Guide, Warden’s Manual, and the full Another Bug Hunt module. I decided early on that I was going to challenge myself with running a module (which I have only done a few times in my gaming career, preferring to create my own worlds and stories instead). On this first read through, a few things stood out to me as worth noting. 

First, the main mechanism for pressure in the game is the Stress mechanic. Whenever a roll goes poorly, stress increases. Eventually, this should lead to difficulties succeeding at rolls, and eventually Panic checks. This sets up the rhythm of increasing tension throughout a session, where there is a spiral down toward the eventual demise or bare survival of the party. This is where the Fun(TM) lives in the game. 

Second, the Warden’s Manual does a great job teaching how to set up the peaks and valleys of a good horror game, creating tension, relieving tension. The Warden’s manual is the advice book I wanted to exist when prepping horror for Stars Without Number, Darkhope, and the several sessions I’ve run of Dread.  I’m really excited to use it deliberately in future games.

Third, at first glance, the one-shot scenario in Another Bug Hunt reads as an Aliens 2 rewrite.  It was surprising how much our play session ended up as a different experience entirely. 

Additionally, as I was prepping for the game, I wanted to test myself to improvise on the fly and not need to do heavy prepping. I made no notes, but tried to visualize areas in the module, understand where the pressure and relief would come from, and think through how to create that feeling at the table. Whether that succeeded or not is up to my players, but I didn’t feel particularly unprepared at any time during the session.

**What went well:** 

**Digital dice and character creation:**

Mothership has a character creation app, that allows a character to be created in literally 5 minutes or less. Select a class, click some buttons for stats and saves, and decide if you want a random loadout or not. 

And then, throughout the whole session, your character is on your phone. Need to roll a combat check at advantage? Click click, then a the result. And it automatically adds stress on a failure.  I never noticed how much time at the table could be spent on asking what dice to roll and interpreting. Using the app was seemless. 

**Rhythm:**

Setting the horror tone and creating pressure: I had already decided that the game would operate in 3 Acts. Act 1 was discovery, some exploration and the first sign of real threats. Act 2 was about the first encountered with the aliens, and Act3 was the death spiral and the rush to escape. This worked super well! Tension mounted and was released throughout the night, and it was really fun to watch how the players interacted and played with the game pieces. In the “didn’t go well” section, I talk about how some elements of the tension *weren’t* relieved and why this made for a bad writing and threw off some of the rhythm. 

**Player engagement:**

The horror element, the setting, knowing that your characters were disposable and designed to be either. The players screamed, complained, laughted. It was wonderful. 

**Knocking the rust off:**

This was the first RPG I’ve run in about 3 years. I’ve played some GMless games, and a played as a character a few times, but it’s been awhile since I actually ran a game. Given that, things went great! 

**What didn’t go well:**

**Transitioning from module description to improvised description:**

You know how boring it to listen to someone just read their PowerPoint slides? The same thing happens with reading out of a module. The descriptions are good but sparse. Because I’m not used to running modules, there were several times when I simply read out of the module the descriptions, and did not further embellish. From my view, this is wrong and novice work. My job as a GM-Warden, is to create in my player’s mind an idea of what they are encountering and seeing and merely reading out of the module just isn’t sufficient. I will do better next time! This was my biggest personal critique of the night and seems like an easy enough fix.

**OSR style play:**

As a mild qualifier to the above point, it is also a characteristic of OSR-style play for the players to ask for more information, ask questions, literally describe what their characters do. It’s common for players who have been steeped in modern DnD to struggle with this. In modern DnD, your character sheet describes what you can do and what you’re good at. In OSR games, there are no skills or feats or class abilities to support you; your character sheet is sparse. Player skill is paramount and one of the critical skills is asking questions. 

We ran into a few snags in this and frankly, I did a mixed job of encouraging this style of play, definitely resorting back to a modern DnD style of GMing around combat encounters.

Despite this being a bit clunky, this was the most fun element of the game to me, forcing my players to simply describe what they wanted to do. The number of bids that were essentially “Perception” check requests because the players were scared to go into a room was amazing and it felt fun as a horror GM to say, “you’ll have to get closer and actually touch it to find out.” 

**Fear becomes paralyzing:**

Our session was a long one. I intended it to push along for about 3 hours or so, but we ended up playing for close to 5. Additionally, the module has “bad stuff” happen basically every time players do things, which I believe unintentionally teaches the players to stop interacting. In a way, this is kind of cool: a group of marines land on an alien world and slowly the morale breaks until they are feeling hopeless. But in practice, we had several stalling moments toward the end of the evening, where the players were both tired and it seemed like every pathway was bad or risky. 

I believe this is a feature of the game and not a bug, but that doesn’t make it good! Eventually, they pushed through and one of the players just said “Fuck it. I’m gonna go fight the damn thing,” and that spilled us into the final stages of Act 3. This has me wondering how I can create pressure and forward momentum so that those moments of paralysis don’t pile up. What a fun story-telling puzzle! 

**Another Bug Hunt Module:**

I touched on this in the above point, but it’s bad design to make most of the routes to success unexpected traps and problems. The module is riddled with “this seems like a good idea but surprise, it’s not.” The booby trapped armored vehicle in the same room as the first real encounter with the Carc marine is one such example.

Additionally, I find the Carc’s monster design boring. They are basically just biological chainsaws with no special abilities and thick skins. The reason that the xenomorphs of the Alien franchise work is because they have multiple stages (huggers, xenomorphs, queen), multiple objectives (defend, hunt, implant), can’t be attacked without the consequence of acid blood and they don’t always kill you. The carc’s are written to just attack and hurt you. 

I modified them on the fly to have their armor break, so they went from impossible to hurt, to suddenly harm able. (Though I wish I had telegraphed this better!) I also made them have a close range use of the Shriek, which could infect the players. Thinking of this further, I would have made them either slow and tankier or fast and fragile (maybe they can adapt and some skin color change indicates if they are in slow mode or fast mode?), and given them an obvious weakness to light or something like that. I wanted there to be some mechanism for the players to funnel the monster or to flee. More choices and less “Fight or flee.”  

**Playing in my GMing weakness:**

I am really good at characters, creating my own scenarios, social encounters and complex and fun combat encounters. This game was a sci-fi dungeon crawl written by someone else, with virtually no NPC’s, no real social encounters, with a highly simplified monster combat. Add on that this was a new game to me and the players, and I’m basically picking up one of the more challenging GMing tasks I could. I had so much fun getting the reps in on these skills, but it definitely felt like GMing with one hand behind my back. 

**Conclusion:**

Overall, I’m very pleased with the game. Most of the clunkiness we experienced can be attributed to a new system and using someone else’s created module, and most of the success can be contributed to clever and fun players, good tension and release cycles, and solid mechanical support from the Stress system. 

I’d love to run another few Mothership sessions, perhaps using other materials from Tuesday Games, or running my own game. I’d especially love to follow the advice of the Warden’s Guide, and build out a horror scenario using their structure.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x12134faa0>,osr,1733712037.0

You're Sleeping On Swyvers - A Short Review,"(Originally a blog found [*here*](https://talesfromthelamp.substack.com/p/review-swyvers-bloody-good-writing))

I'm not a massive fan of most TTRPG reviews. I don't think they can always capture the essence of a system, how individual players would engage with it in a specific session, under the specific conditions it is run in, and with any given individual's specific GMing ""style"".

I am, however, a massive fan of [**Swyvers**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/melsonia/swyvers). I also think you, yes *you* dear reader, should give it a go. I did, and my players have been loving it since; I'll share some banger play reports one day I promise!

So, instead of trying to articulate what I find so great about the rules themselves, I'd like to focus on another aspect - just how brilliantly the rules are written...

Here is a sampling of my favourite phrases.

Too often when writing rules systems writers don't focus on writing. How you articulate the rules, and present an implied setting, is just as important as what rules you do create. Put some **voice** into your rule-books, even if it's just subtle!

As a result of Gearing's use of this voice, the Swyvers bestiary is a treat. Not just because there are some unique, beautifully grungy, creatures contained within - but because each foe and danger has a nickname or codeword given by locals. You really get the sense that hushed tales of *""Blinking Larrys""* and *""the Green Grocers""* swirl over whatever piss-ale they serve in the flea-bitten inns of The Smoke; and it builds up these creatures to a semi-legendary status.

So yeah, I really recommend [**Swyvers**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/melsonia/swyvers). [**The Kickstarter**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/melsonia/swyvers) has less than a week left (***!!!***) and I'm sad it hasn't raked in more cash; but I guess that's just the nature of TTRPGs right now. The world very much needs more games like Swyvers, designed as passion projects by people who love creating games foremost, and it is sobering to watch sharted out film tie-in games and soul-less 5e modules get more attention and money.

Heck, you can even (at time of writing) get the Swyvers rules for **$1** on [DriveThru](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/467572/swyvers-quickstart) and for **FREE** on [Itch](https://melsonian-arts-council.itch.io/swyvers) - but [Melsonia](https://www.melsonia.com/) know how to make nice physical books (Every Troika edition is a real gem) so you should go with dead-tree if you can afford it!

But yes, please [**back it**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/melsonia/swyvers) if this interested you - I think it's really good.
Thank you for reading.

Sincerly,
A 'Umble Cheesethief

Grognardia Wulfwald Review,"Another good Wulfwald review. This time at JMal's Grognardia. 

Which is nice as Grognardia was one of my main reads back when I was first learning about OD&D and the wargaming roots of RPGs. All of which was news to me as a snot nosed UK kid who started with T&T and B/X D&D.

A lot of Grognardia's OD&D archeology had an impact on Wulfwald.

Do you let the creator of a game influence whether or not you play/support it?,"I am an OD&D nerd and have enjoyed the recent publication from Wizards of the Coast about the original game. That sent me down a rabbit hole of retro-clones, I think they’re called. 

Al’Qadim was always my favorite 2nd Edition setting, so I was drawn to this obscure game I found called Seven Voyages of Zylarthen that is more swords and sandals than European fantasy. It reads like OD&D but, frankly, better in many respects. got some glowing reviews so I snagged it.

Yeah, it’s utterly brilliant. 

Unfortunately, I also found out in my wanderings that the creator is explicitly Islamophobic, or at least was when he was blogging many years ago. Seems like he has left the hobby. 

I want to champion a masterpiece of a game but struggle to separate art from artist, despite enjoying a game made by people as flawed and of their time as I certainly am in 2025. I also don’t want to attract the wrong kinds of people if I advertise games for it.

"DDA3: ""The Eye of Traldar"" (1991) Review","# Intro

Some months ago, my friends and I watched several videos by [Mr. Welch](https://www.youtube.com/@Mr_Welch) talking about the old-school D&D setting Mystara. His passion for the game and its setting clearly showed though and it sounded incredibly interesting. So, I volunteered to run a game for my tabletop group.

I decided I wouldn’t do a conversion or anything, so I actually ran the game in BECMI using the RulesCyclopedia. 

I didn’t have much experience DMing though, so I asked for suggestions for good modules for first time DMs and got some pretty good tips (seriously, thank you so much for your suggestions everyone!). Following [this suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/19dxo6l/comment/kjd5oyk/) by the amazing u/Gigoachef, I decided to start with the module *The Eye of Traldar*.

My group just finished last week, so I thought I would give a review of my experiences with the module as well as my thoughts on the system in general.

# Summary

The adventure started with my players’ characters – a fighter, a magic-user, and elf, and a cleric – sitting around a campfire off the side of the main road. Suddenly a man rushes past on horseback, and his horse is shot out from under him. He falls into the camp and the group is now attacked by unknown assailants. The magic-user is able to dispatch half of them with a sleep spell while the elf and fighter pick off the others with their bow and sword, respectively.

After the battle the man introduces himself as Alexei. He was tracking down a magical artifact called the Eye of Traldar which can be used to control minds and was stolen by the evil Baron Ludwig von Hendriks of the comically named Fort Doom.

As they did not trust anyone operating from a place called “Fort Doom” to have an artifact that could control minds, the players all immediately volunteered to help Alexei recover the Eye.

The party heads to the nearby town of Luln where they get in ambush and the fighter dies. Next session, that player rolls up a dwarf and an NPC tells the party that the Baron is currently away and they’re keeping the eye in a mage’s tower inside the fort’s ~~keep~~ gatehouse. They are given some disguises and a Staff of Healing (which also happened to have five charges of Cure Disease on it) and then they head to the city of Fort Doom.

They meet another NPC in the city who tells them that the best way into the fortress is though some monster-filled caves which the Baron throws prisoners into. The caves themselves are a pretty standard. The players went through them room by room, killing various ghouls, skeletons, and even a carrion crawler. The real danger in this cave though? The giant rats.

Knowing that each time a rat hits you, you have a 5% chance of catching a disease which will kill you in 1d6 days, my players ran from the giant rats whenever they came across them and went out of their way to avoid the obvious rat room.

After killing the cave boss – a bugbear, his dog, and his three zombies – the players went up into the fort’s dungeons.

Like, the literal dungeons; the prisons below the fort.

Here’s where the adventure started getting interesting. The actual dungeon level was mostly non-linear, with multiple paths through it, giving the players lots of options in how to explore. First, the players questioned the prisoners for information and promised to free them on their way out.

They also found a torturer and his victim. They killed the torturer in a fight and then the edgelord player mercy killed the dying victim before he could use his last words to reveal where he had hidden his treasure.

Oh well!

They found and orc chained in a cell and decided to kill it. The magic-user then threw molotov cocktails at it until it burned to death. Of course, had they fed it and set it free, it would have joined them as an ally.

Oh well!

Eventually they found the guard barracks. A fight ensures and they get overwhelmed. In order to salvage the situation, the elf uses Charm Person on the head guard and they have the last remaining guard thrown in prison. They then get some information and head up into the ~~keep~~ gatehouse where they use some stolen uniforms to bluff the guards into letting them through without a fight.

This is where the main part of the adventure starts. The ~~keep~~ gatehouse contains large courtyard surrounded by high walls. In the middle is a three story mage’s tower. The players need to sneak around the courtyard either by night or in disguise. Going from building to building fighting or bluffing their way past enemies, grabbing treasure, and looking for the pass they need to get into the tower. It’s very non-linear and gives the plays a lot of latitude in how they want to approach it.

Or they could do what my one of my players did and skip all that by annoying the doorman of the tower until he actually called out his boss (a necromancer cleric) and he and his six skeletons come out and starts a fight.

Also, they split the party.

Do to a series of ridiculously lucky rolls they managed to not die (seriously, if I had not rolled so poorly, those skeletons would butchered the dwarf and cleric). And after turning the skeletons, the magic-user then put the cleric and some of the snipers on the battlements to sleep with a well aimed sleep spell allowing the party to easily dispatch them.

They then proceeded to enter the tower. Inside they found an alchemist (A low-level magic-user) and pressed him for information. After figuring that he was forced to work for the Baron and didn’t know anything, they let him go.

They continued up the tower until they got to the top floor where they had to fight all of its inhabitants at once; a magic-user, a thief, and that doorman. After charming the thief and killing the other two, they learn that they kicked up enough of a commotion that the Eye had been moved to the main gates and was being prepared to be sent to the Baron. They were also able to loot an elven cloak (enemies can’t detect the wearer unless they roll a 1 on a d6).

The players, now in panic mode, rushed out of the tower where they came across two skeletons standing over the body of the alchemist. Because, as it turns out, turning undead doesn’t make them go away forever!

After killing the skeletons, they ran to the gates leading into the fortress proper. They knew they couldn’t open them, so they decided to split the party, each group going into the buildings on either side of the gates to find the mechanism to open them. (They didn’t need to do this. They just needed to knock and they could have bluffed their way in!)

The elf and magic-user went to the left, opening the door and coming across a latrine filled with giant rats. The elf’s eyes watered as the smell hit her like a punch to the face. She closed the door without going in and they decided to join back with the other group.

The dwarf and cleric went to the right, breaking down the door to the room and immediately going murderhobo on the guard captain and his assistant. As the elf and magic-user came to help, the magic-user decided to (for reasons I cannot comprehend) pelt the door of the latrine with molotov cocktails.

This caused the noxious methane gas within to ignite and explode. This is the sort of thing the magic-user’s player does a lot (like he has ended several past campaigns for our other DM due to his character doing arson or blowing things up).

This immediately drew the attention of all the guards in the fort’s main gate. The magic-user immediately retreated into the guard station with the dwarf and cleric while the elf donned the elven cloak and tried to kill the enemy magic-user from behind.

The fighter, cleric, and the NPC Alexei (he’s still with the party; he’s a 3^(rd) level fighter) formed a choke point at the door of the building while the magic-user tossed molotov cocktails into the enemy lines. While he did kill a lot of enemies this way, he also flubbed one of his rolls and hit the cleric, burning him to death.

Oh well!

Just as the elf was getting overwhelmed I had the two characters she had charmed ride in and help dispatch some of the enemies that were surrounding her.

After dispatching the enemies, the players, knowing reinforcements were on their way, grabbed the Eye of Traldar off the enemy magic-user and the Staff of Healing off of the cleric’s burning corpse and made their escape.

The way they were *supposed* to do this according to the module was to steal some horses from the stable and bluff their way through the front gate. But, since the players did the mage’s tower first, they never found the stables.

So, they headed back through the dungeons, letting all the prisoners free (netting them a nice 50 xp per group), and going back out through the caves. Also the dead cleric’s player rolled up a thief and joined up with the party when they let him out of his cell.

Cleverly, they set a formation before entering the caves, with the dwarf and Alexei in the front, the prisoners and charmed NPCs taking up the center, and the thief, elf, and magic-user in the back.

This was smart, because I totally had the rats they didn’t kill on their first time through ambush them on their way out. That’s right! You thought you could get away with not killing all the enemies on a dungeon level!? Not on my watch! Muahahaha!

The rats seemed especially agitated and were covered in soot, as though something above their den had exploded somehow.

Anyway the players made it though without catching any disease from the rats and that basically ended the adventure. They rode off to Luln to report into the NPC there and then rode to the capital of Specularum to go on further adventures.

# My thoughts the adventure

Overall, *The Eye of Traldar* was a great experience. Fort Doom had some top-tier dungeon design. I can see why this module would be recommended for new players. It starts off simply before ramping up in complexity, letting the players and DM get used to the mechanics over time. The assault on the ~~keep~~ gatehouse itself is especially good in how open it is and how many ways there are to go about exploring it. The encounters were also set up in clever ways, requiring the players to think tactically about how to approach them.

The module also has tips for new DMs. Those were okay, but not perfect. A lot of them had to do with what to do if new players weren’t really getting into the “spirit” of D&D. But that was not really a problem with my players, who are pretty experienced at tabletop. On the other hand, a lot of areas that could have used some tips didn’t have much to offer. The dungeons are pretty open, with a lot of room for players to go off the rails. So some tips on what to do if the players took certain actions (like not finding the stables, for example) might have been nice.

There were a few small print mistakes in the book I had. For example, the titular Eye of Traldar first was listed as being stolen from the Lake of Lost Souls but later listed as being stolen from the Lake of Lost Dreams (Lake of Lost Dreams is the canon name. It’s the one that shows up on the official maps of Mystara). Also, Alexei promises 25 gold to the players for escorting him to Luln, but a different NPC is listed as giving them 50 when they arrive.

Also, the writers do not know what a “keep” is.

According to [medievalbritain.com](https://medievalbritain.com/type/medieval-life/architecture/parts-of-a-medieval-castle-the-keep/), a castle’s keep is “the strongest portion of a medieval fortification and the last resort in case of a siege or attack. It was usually a fortified tower built within the walls”. In the text, the module repeatedly describes the area the Eye of Traldar in as a “keep”, but it is absolutely not a keep. It has a gate leading into the fortress proper, as well as one leading into the town. This makes it a [gatehouse](https://www.exploring-castles.com/castle_designs/gatehouse/), not a keep.

It just bothered me, is all. It took me like, an hour of reading the module, looking at the maps, and researching medieval castles to figure out where this was supposed to take place.

But aside from that, excellent adventure. 10/10. No notes.

# Changes

While the adventure was really fun and well designed, I did make a few changes to it. Mostly just minor things for convenience or pacing.

The main change I made was to convert all the AC values from THAC0 to a more modern AC system using this [invaluable guide](https://caressofsteel.github.io/demos/dndrulescyclopedia/) from the amazing CaressofSteel. Seriously, the work they did in clarifying and correcting ambiguous or incorrect rules from the RulesCyclopedia was amazing. Thank you so much dude.

I changed some of Alexei’s introduction as well. In the module, he’s being chased by Iron Ring slavers when he runs into the player’s camp, forcing them to fight off *his* enemies just to defend themselves. It made him come off as a bit of an asshole. So, I made him fall into the camp by accident, that way it felt less like he was intentionally dragging the players into his problems.

I also cut out a lot of the exposition from the start. Alexei spends three long paragraphs describing his backstory to the players. It all came off as very convoluted, and didn’t actually have much to do with the plot of the module, so I cut most of it out. In the town of Luln, the players also had to visit multiple shops and talk to several NPCs who mostly felt extraneous to the adventure, so I combined most of those into a single encounter with a single NPC to simplify it and move them faster to the main adventure.

Near the beginning of the adventure, the players get a Staff of Healing. I added a few charges of Cure Disease to the it since a party of level one players will have no other way to treat disease, I thought that was my best option.

Finally, I implemented some variant rules from the August 1980 edition of Dragon Magazine for burning oil (molotov cocktails). Basically, on a failed roll, I roll a d8 and the bottle hits a random square around its intended target. This did end up killing the cleric, but it does kinda balance what is one of the strongest weapons at low levels.

# Thoughts on BECMI D&D

Overall, I found BECMI to be a really fun system to run. I’m more used to playing Pathfinder, so there were definitely some oddities, but it still runs really well. It’s especially interesting seeing the different assumptions in how the writers approached game design and balance.

It’s neat that the different races count as classes and that each class levels differently and has different level caps. That’s a unique way of balancing things.

One especially cool mechanic is that you can “microdose” certain potions. For example you can drink a potion of invisibility making you invisible for an hour, of you can divide it into six “sips” giving you ten minutes of invisibility per sip.

Combat is quick and satisfyingly deadly. None of my players’ characters had more than six health and most enemies could do a d6 of damage. So even a single mistake could be deadly, which forced the players to think carefully about when and how to engage in combat. So they often relied on bluffing their way out of combat or using underhanded tactics to avoid danger.

It was also interesting that initiative was rolled each round for the whole party, rather than individually, which gave the game a bit of a tactical, Fire Emblem-esque feel.

Skill checks are also done in a really unique way in this edition. Rather than getting a bonus based on your skill, you try and roll under that skill. So, if the party is trying to do an Int check, they roll a d20. The magic-user with an Int of 17 has to roll a 17 or less, while the fighter with an Int of 11 has a much lower margin of error. Since stats cap at 18, it actually makes a lot of logical sense when rolling a d20 to try and roll low, since there’s always a chance of failure, but each stat point feels like it really matters.

On the other hand, it does get a little confusing how the rolls aren’t consistent. For skills you want to roll low, for attacks you want to roll high. To search for secret doors you want a 1 on a d6, to open doors you want a 5 or a 6.

It’s pretty rules-light overall, so there’s a lot of room to improvise and interpret things. Which is cool! But some things just aren’t explained that well or left up to interpretation when more explanation would be better. Turning undead is a prime example of this, where there is a huge amount of discretion for the DM on how turned undead are supposed to behave and how long they actually stay turned. I also kind of wish The RulesCyclopedia was more well arranged. It’s often hard to find the information you need.

Another thing is that magic-users are a bit of a pain at level one. They only have one spell and no cantrips. So, once they cast their one spell, they’re basically dead weight. I do get that that’s part of the game balance; magic-users are supposed to be super weak at low levels, but if they survive they become terrifyingly strong. But, in practice, it makes them pretty boring to play at level 1 since they can’t meaningfully contribute except maybe once per dungeon level. That’s why about halfway through the adventure, I let my magic-user buy burning oil and a sling (which were allowed under an optional rule set), so they could do something even when they had used their spell for the day.

On the other hand, even certain first level spells could be terrifyingly powerful. Sleep is always cited as a particularly OP spell that can trivialize most low-level encounters. But, Charm Person is probably my favorite though, since it can have a potentially *infinite* duration. The spell has no fixed duration, but depending on the victims Int, they get a saving throw anywhere from every few hours to every few *weeks*. For a first level spell. It’s pretty amusing, honestly.

Overall though, I really enjoyed DMing *The Eye of Traldar* and running it in BECMI. My players are pretty interested in continuing, so we’re probably going keep playing for the foreseeable future. Next we might do a few minor adventures and then I’m hoping to do *Dark Knight’s Terror*. I’ve heard it’s a pretty good followup to *The Eye of Traldar*.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1214b78c0>,osr,1719880435.0

DnD 'Honour among Thieves' review: It's good [minor spoilers],"TLDR: It's a good fun movie; not great, but solidily fun with an incredibly charasmatic cast.

I was not going to watch the movie as the whole OGL scandal really soured me on WotC, but the early reviews were good and I liked some of the actors involved so went to an early screening last night - and the movie was good.

It's not particularly risky or revolutionary, but it has some great humour and some big laugh out loud moments in the cinema and is very enjoyable.

I don't know how but they managed to find possibly the most charasmatic cast in Hollywood, and they are pretty uniformly great - Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Rege Page, Sophia Lillis, Daisy Head all are very watchable with Justice Smith as Simon the Sorcerer and Hugh Grant being the stand outs.

The plot is standard fair.  It's nothing special and I'd even say some of the plot turns are not that logical and sometimes feel forced, but the film works because of the humour and the general 'good feeling'.

The Red Wizards were a bit too cartoon villainy for my liking.  The main female baddy is good but we get a shot of Szass Tan and there is none of the subtley of the character; they just went for 'shadowy evil'.  I guess it''s fair enough but even Megatron has some campy evil about him.

As to the 'DnD'ness of it, the Forgotten Realms is such a compelling setting and it's really great to see it come to life and see some Iconic DnD monsters and locales; I particularly liked the detour into the underdark.

Overall I would recommend the movie to all DnD fans, even if they are soured on WotC, as it's a fun night in the cinema, and to all non DnD fans as the movie stands on it's own merits.

7.5/10

&#x200B;

"(Blog post) Review: Brimstone, a ""high action"" OSR game and toolkit","My latest blog post at Gundobad Games reviews the recent RPG, *Brimstone*.

From my review:

>*Brimstone* assumes a late medieval/early Modern setting, something like that of *Lamentations of the Flame Princess* or *Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay* (I don't think it would be too hard to reskin to other settings). Here, as in *WFRP*, your character may end up missing limbs, blown up by a blackpowder weapon's misfire, charred by a backfiring spell, or ruing the day they made one deal too many with nefarious cosmic powers. **Unlike** ***WFRP*****, however,** ***Brimstone*** **emphasizes capable, creative heroes who are just as likely to dish out serious hurt on their foes - and do so with flair.** Offering almost cinematic action with OSR-compatibility and low mechanical complexity, *Brimstone* is not just a game about random almost-heroes dying in a gutter. Again, the game's stated goals combine *high action* with *high peril*.

"Battle-Scarred Yet Still Standing, My Review of Keep on the Borderlands","Howdy folks, I write an adventure review and design blog called [Parables of the Weeping Stag.](https://theweepingstag.wordpress.com/) This week I wrote a sort of retrospective/review for the classic module *Keep on the Borderlands,* which I have run twice now!

The God That Crawls (actual play review),"\[contains affiliate links and some self-promo. previously posted [here](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2023/02/the-god-that-crawls-actual-play-review.html)\]

[The God That Crawls](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/105954/The-God-that-Crawls?affiliate_id=403100)\*, is a LotFP adventure by James Raggi (if you don't know LoTFP, [read this](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2023/01/a-glance-at-basic-d-bx-and-some-clones.html)). Here is the blurb:

>A murdering cult.A religious order dedicated to protecting sacred history.An ancient catacomb full of danger and reward.The God that CrawlsA  dungeon chase adventure for characters of levels 1–2 for use with  Lamentations of the Flame Princess Weird Fantasy Role-Playing and other  traditional role-playing games.

**Why did I buy/read this?** I find many LotFP adventures interesting, including [Better Than Any Man](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/116452/Better-Than-Any-Man?affiliate_id=403100), which you can get for free. So I've gathered some for my [current sandbox](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2022/10/sandbox-quest.html), including this one.

**Review**:Like  many LotFP adventures, this has awesome ideas, mixed with strange  stuff. It seems like they always intended to do something novel instead  of the tired ""goblins and skeletons in adjacent rooms"" that you can find  in many D&D adventures, and I commend them for that. On  the other hand, this taste for novelty sometimes makes the adventures  become ""anti-adventures"" - instead of something that is easy to use,  they become partially exciting, partially unusable.For example: instead of providing hooks, this book says:

>The hook or motivation to get the player characters to the church is up to the Referee, who would know how to get the players involved better than any adventure writer. No hooks that cast suspicion on the priest or villagers before the adventure begins should be used, as the natural paranoia of adventurer swill be in effect anyway.\[...\]Father Bacon is the leader of both the church, the community around it \[...\] He will be very adamant about not allowing visitors beyond the altar of the church. \[...\]   
>  
>It is perfectly possible (even likely with some groups) that player characters will not fall for any of the tricks and will not be trapped in the dungeon, especially ifthe Referee seems a little too eager to get them down there. No matter. If they just walk away, they are leaving a lot of treasure behind. If they do something rash like slaughter the priest and/or a bunchof villagers and walk away, they will havethe legitimate authorities after them soon and that will be adventure enough. Force nothing; this adventure provide san environment and a handy guide forresolving “What happens if…?” within that environment. This adventure is nota club with which to bludgeon players.

So,  you need a strong motive to invade a church, that the book doesn't  provide. On the other hand, if you do invade it, the book advises you  that the PCs should be drugged or captured by troops and tossed into the  dungeon. And if the PCs don't want to explore... eh, what can you do?  Maybe choose another adventure.

\[In practice, Raggi was partially  right - the usual PC paranoia made sure that one PC insisted enough on  exploring the catacombs that they convinced the priest. Had I followed  the instructions to the letter, maybe the PC would have to choose  violence against the priest or simply leaving.\]

There is basically  one monster and LOTS of treasure. It is an interesting setup, and GREAT  for a change of pace. The monster is basically too strong for the PCs,  and the fact that there is only one main, unique antagonist makes it  feel ""special"".

**The goal of this module** is forcing the  players to think about encumbrance, movement, and mapping. The life of  the PCs depend on it. And there is more treasure and artifacts than the  PCs can carry, making these choices really meaningful. If you play this  module handwaving movement and encumbrance, you're missing half of the  point.

However, there are so much gold and magic items (and most  of them in a single location) that it makes them feel less special.  Also, most are cursed or dangerous, to the point of saturation.Books?  Some will kill will with no save, others will curse you, and one will  eventually destroy the universe. Scrolls will cause genocide across  Europe if sold to the highest bidder. or give you +1 attack bonus for  killing your parents. Magic weapon? Cursed. Statues? Cursed. Jewel?  Feeds on blood or maybe sucks you into the void if you try to take it. A  pile of excrement? Well, now *that* might be useful!

There are also ordinary potions and scrolls, and many items that the PCs will probably not be able to understand, carry or use.

In  short, unless you have an easy way of identifying magic items (e.g.,  ""make a spell saving throw"", etc.), you'll need another session after  the PCs have escaped to even start making sense of what they got. Or, if  the PCs are creative and want to test the items on the spot, they'll  probably pay dearly for it (and become discouraged *fast*).And then there is stuff like this:

>If at any point a character takes exactly 8points of damage (at once or cumulative,not 7 or less, not 9 or more, but at somepoint has taken exactly 8 points) while on the chariot, from any source, he dissipates into a whirlwind of sorrow and pain. Any player who laughs at this naturally withoutprompting can dictate the results of any one die throw in the future (do not reveal thisuntil the chariot stops). If it is the player whose character has disintegrated thatlaughs, he gets to determine the results of any two die throws in the future (includingduring new character creation).Any players caught laughing insincerely because they have read the adventure and wish to get the bonus must paint their nose yellow for the rest of the game session. If no yellow substance suitable for this purpose is available, one of that player’s character ability scores, selected at random, will be reduced to 3 until such time as the player completes an entire session with a yellow painted nose. Note this is a player-facing effect and new characters suffer this fate until the player complies.

I get that this is supposed to be humor... but it happens often, in random places, throughout the adventure.

**Anyway, the actual dungeon is really good.** It  gives you a labyrinthine feeling right away, with all its passages, ups  and downs, etc. Aside for a few situations where you just can't win  (best not to engage at all), most objects are interesting and provide  clues for the challenges ahead. The map is  decent (and good-looking) but I've found it hard to navigate due to the  (baffling) use of roman numerals and shades of blue and green that look  very similar on the screen (also, it is printed in black and white in  other parts of the book). There are enough stairs that will make you  flip back and forth constantly. Finding the way out took me a while. I  misunderstood one door to be barred from the wrong side, but that's  probably on me. 

In short: spend some time studying the maps before running this module.

**If you want to tone things down**,  you can change some of this stuff or allow some saving throws, or roll  to identify items... Alternatively, I think it would be fair to start  with a hook that allows the players that they are going into a place  full of stuff that might be better left buried, and that they must be  incredibly careful when interacting with it.

The art in this product (by Jason Rainville) is awesome and flavorful.

The  writing is good (if verbose), the backstory is great, and overall I'd  recommend checking this out if you want to play something different than  the usual stuff. I enjoyed running it and may even leave the players an  opportunity to go back (they escaped with lots of treasure, so I'm not  sure of what they're doing next).

**OVERVIEW** ([explanation here](http://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2021/02/so-reviews-and-mini-reviews-actual.html)):

**Usable**? Yes, with a bit of GM work it becomes a great adventure.

**Inspiring**? Definitely! Turns the idea of ""monsters in the dungeon"" on its head, it has great flavor and novelty.

**Bloated**?  A bit. You could cut the page count by half if you wanted something  more straightforward -although I'm sure there are people that enjoy the  absurdist humor, the crazy ideas, etc..

**Tiresome**? No, except, again, for the ""paint your nose yellow"" ideas.

**Clear**? Yes, except maybe for the map.

**In short**:  Awesome for a change of pace, requires some modification if you aren't  interested in giving PCs of levels 1-2 the opportunity to become  insanely rich, obtain legendary artifacts and potentially cause genocide  and world destruction... or if you don't want to tell the players to  put their character sheets in an envelope and leave in a public place  yadda yadda. Way more interesting than most ""vanilla"" adventures.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x120d6fce0>,osr,1676036929.0

* Abilities are not scores, but descriptive (i.e. Light-footed, Mighty, Footman), either providing an extra die when attempting something anyone could attempt, a roll of two dice when attempting something which would only be possible with training, or a special capability such as magic. 

* The system is classless, with the choice of abilities determining the type of character.

* Kindred - there are rules for elves and dwarves. Dwarves roll three dice for all saves (except death) and two dice to detect unsafe conditions underground or in the mountains. Elves always have an initiative of at least 8 going into combat (initiative seems pretty important in the game -- combat abilities only providing their bonus die if you win it) and can move stealthily in armor. Both Elves and Dwarves start with 10 HP and 1 ability. Humans get +5 HP (15) and an extra ability.

* Armor and shields provide a save versus death at 0HP. A success means +5HP but the armor is damaged.

* Advancement is awarded for finishing quests, combat, and major treasures. Leveling up means more HP and adding additional abilities. 

* Magic is free-form but limited in how many times it can be cast (once per day/lvl) and extent (having to do with duration, amount of damage, the number effected etc.) and cannot be cast in armor.

* The game is complete in 64 pages, with monster and treasure details and a lightly sketched out campaign setting.

My thoughts -- it's elegant and looks super fun. The single mechanic means that it will be super easy to hack -- adding new Kindred and abilities. The book looks great, using attractive and good sized fonts and woodblock style art, and at 64 digest pages is a good candidate for printing and stapling yourself (the woodcuts will use a good amount of ink, and I laid each page out to dry after printing using an inkjet). 

The writing itself is interesting -- it has a definite style and character which I really like, although it may come at the expense of clarity at times. Not at all in a bad way -- more like Gygaxian, where here and there you find yourself reading a sentence more than once to understand its import, and yet the charm of the writing makes it worth it. 

There was also at least one place where an idea was introduced (invisibility in relation to the monster Feydark -- basically dark elves) and the rule was elaborated elsewhere (invisibility and how to handle it is discussed in relation to invisibility potions). The nice thing is the book is a quick read so it doesn't take much time to read the rules in their entirety.

I would think converting other OSR material for use with Mydwandr would be relatively trivial. 

All in all, I think it's totally worth [checking out](http://www.oldehouserules.com/mydwandr.html).",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x120e39160>,osr,1698684127.0

8 Old School Dungeon Ideas (Old School Review),"# [8 Old School Dungeon Ideas for Your OSR Game](https://samseer.substack.com/p/8-old-school-dungeon-ideas-worth)

This month, I had the chance to read another classic module: **B1: In Search of the Unknown.** 

Reading old modules can be tough— the layout is dense and the good ideas are often buried. So I've been trying to organize the best bits in a presentable way so other people can benefit.

Hope you find something useful or inspiring for your own game!  


P.S. This one was special because I had a physical print copy that belonged to my dad.

Magic Items Review,"These items are themed for the Dolmenwood setting. They once belonged to Lord Orpheo Guillefer, but have since been lost. If all the items are collected and a ritual is performed within the inner sanctum of the Halls of Sleep (citadel of House Guillefer) the bearer of these items will be granted some additional special powers, yet to be determined. (But likely something to do with astral projection, or entrance to the lands of fairy)

I’m looking for feedback on my descriptions, the abilities/drawbacks, and maybe an idea of what to do with the “Ring of Reverie” I’ve kinda lost my steam.

Circlet of Slumber — A white-gold circlet set with amethysts, emblazoned with the seal of House Guillefer upon its brow. The wearer gets a good nights rest no matter the conditions, and recovers HP while sleeping or resting with a +1 bonus (2 hp a night, or 1d3+1 a day). However, the wearer is often overcome with a great weariness, resulting in them always acting last during combat (as if they had lost initiative), and having a 1-6 chance of spontaneously falling asleep each round of combat. (Once worn, the owner of this circle is compelled to wear it at all times, and will not discard it unless a successful Remove Curse spell is performed.)

Scepter of Somnabulance (10 charges) — An ornate scepter of platinum, encrusted with iridescent stones, topped with the yawning visage of a manticore. The wielder of this scepter seems to shuffle about with the least concern, their speed is reduced by 10’, and they are unable to make forced marches. This scepter may be wielded as a magical club as long as it has at least one charge (+2, 1d4+2). Its charges may be replenished by ritually anointing the scepter in the water of Dark Mirror Lake under the light of the Full Narrow Moon. 

- If the wielder of the scepter is an arcane spellcaster, or also wears the Circlet of Slumber, they may cast the following spells using the appropriate number of charges:
    * Vapours of Dream (1 charge)
    * Phantasm (3 charges)
    * Hallucinatory Terrain (4 charges)

Ring of Reverie —  A thin band of pellucidium dappled with winking adamants, and set with a marquise-cut sapphire between two golden moth’s wings.  (Abilities undetermined)

Black Wyrm of Brandonsford Report/Review,"Finished running Black Wyrm today after 3 3-hour sessions, and love reading people's thoughts on modules, so thought I'd do a little write up.  Really curious to hear how this played out for other people too. Review at the end.

Report:

First session, also first session of the campaign, and first time playing any tabletop in about a decade for the players, so we were all pretty hyped.  Started out in a town central to the region, through out rumors for all the modules I'm prepared to run, and the party bit on rumors of a beast terrorizing the woods around Brandonsford. A day and half walk on the road brought them to town, where they talked with all of the NPCs.  This kinda felt like an info dump, the town has a lot of entries for NPCs, relating to each other, so it was logical that the players would go through chatting with everyone.  Ended up heading to the barrow. A hired NPC dropped to 0 in a fight with some goblins, had to decide right there if I was gonna make this game hardcore mode or not.  He passed a death save, so I ruled he was stable, for now. Session ended there.

&#x200B;

Session 2, the cleric PC caved and expended a healing scroll (loaned by the priest in town) to get the NPC thief above 0 HP, so I called it a second wind and he rejoined the party.  They were doing great in the crypt, moving steadily through level 2.  The cleric gets hit by one of the statues, trying to turn the final ghost, dropping negative.  Failed two death saving throws... thought about killing him, but it just didn't feel right for a PC death at this time with this group, I didn't want to kill the morale I guess.  Had the player take control of an NPC while the cleric was unconscious.  The party then somehow finds healing potions, and fed them all to the cleric.  This seemed significant enough of a splurge, so hey, cleric's back on his feet.  The final puzzle involves recounting phrases found in a room that the party had skipped, and this was practically right at our hard stop time.  Would've been totally lame to end it there with no resolution, a riddle to be solved, so I basically gave it to the party.  After the sesh, felt like I went a little to easy on the players, but we all had a blast anyway.  Everyone was hyped to kill the wyrm next sesh.

&#x200B;

Session 3,  I rule the near death experience left the cleric with -1 to Con.  The party visited most of the remaining locations they had skipped, glossing over the giant's house and the goblin keep.  They get the wine, assemble a spread of goat meat and bread to lure out the wyrm, get it drunk, and slay it.  The other PC's character went negative in this fight too, but the cleric made it to him within seconds to heal with their recently learned cure light wounds.  Didn't feel fair at all to have that character die, and no time was wasted to restore him, so it seemed reasonable.  PCs make it back to town with the hoard and party it up.

&#x200B;

Review:

Great module for a first game with new/long-time-out-of-the-game players, it's just classic DnD, done well.  My players didn't get too involved in the NPC antics (minor plot hole- there's really no reason any of the NPC's in town couldn't just stay up late one night to find the sources of all their problems) but it provided enough life to make the scenario feel fresh, yet still pure tabletop fantasy rpg.  The dungeon was fun and just the right size and danger level to not feel like a slog.  Would I give rumors for this setting to a seasoned group or established campaign?  Maybe not, it's maybe just a tad too vanilla.  But I really enjoyed this and would totally recommend it for a session 1 module for a new or experienced DM.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x120c94230>,osr,1676952510.0

Name Level by Eero Tuovinen -- a review,"""Coup de Main"" is an in-progress campaign and an in-progress rule system by Eero Tuovinen, author of [Muster](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/413382/muster). He is publishing the notes for his system in a series of pamphlet-sized PDFs called Coup Workbook Partials, CWPs for short. This is a review of one of his most recent CWPS, #33, Name Level. A disclaimer: I got the PDF for free in exchange for agreeing to review it.  


First, the art:  


https://preview.redd.it/4e2dyy6hrpac1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee11429319d6e3257c651a78aa04703d8f08aaee

It's just the front cover of the zine, and it's made by a machine learning algorithm, I think trained on 2e-era TSR stuff. I think it's gorgeous. Reminds me of my old '80s Lord of the Rings paperbacks from Ballantine. 

The zine is 24 pages long, including the front and back cover (which are, oddly, both in the front) and two pages of boilerplate.  Pages are A5 with something like 12 point font inside. Might be written in LaTeX, I'm not sure, but the justification is pretty good. The text inside is breezy and reads easily. So you don't get a ton of content for your money, but, luckily, the zine is almost certainly coming to you for free, as it's against the terms of its copywrite to sell it -- the zine is primarily distributed through trades and acts of service.

Now to the meat of the thing.

We begin with a pretty unexceptional overview of the concept of name level. Basically, a high-level D&D character has two options: become a superhero or play the domain game. A character who plays the domain game has a lot of new options open to them, but will also be significantly restricted by the duties of running a domain, so the choice isn't obvious.

If you want to play the domain game, you need a Name. You can get a Name by default when you hit a high enough level ""Name Level"", as per standard D&D -- for instance level 9 for fighting-men in OD&D. Or, Eero adds, you can inherit the name or acquire all its accoutrements in some other way. So if you're the heir of a Lord, and he dies, you become the Lord of his domain, no matter what level you are. Or, if you conquer a domain, you become a Lord, no matter what level you are. I think most GMs will have instituted something like this in their own campaigns -- I know I have -- but it's good to see it formalized.

We then get a few brief mechanisms governing Names. They're really light and unobjectionable. Names soak up XP and have their own ranks separate from character levels, and they give you some bonus HP and bonuses to Name-related tasks. Easy enough, in theory. The specific tasks are left vague and situational, which is one of the hallmarks of Eero's writing. This will either really appeal to you, or turn you off immediately. He's more interesting in a flexible chassis for further experimentation than in a finished set of rules that practically play themselves. Anybody interested in using the CWPs will have to do a *lot* of work themselves to figure out how to model the world. The CWPs are simply tools to help someone model, and the fruits of prior modelling. They are not a DMG. They really are ""partial"".

Following this is a brief (lots of brevity here!) account of the ways a player might customize their Name as they advance through ranks, and the different kinds of Names different classes characteristically have. Again, this is more of a starting-point for experimentation on the part of the player and GM than a finished list of options. But it's a very compelling starting point.

Then comes a section on what the Named character actually does. This is a bit of a whiff, because it really just says ""See my other work on modelling a domain, and the things the leader of a domain might get up to"". I don't have the CWP on domains, so I can't comment on it. Luckily, I think the system presented in *this* CWP is abstract, flexible, *and* concrete enough that you could bolt it on to any domain system you can think of. For instance, it could replace ""Champion Levels"" or whatever they're called in *An Echo, Resounding* by Kevin Crawford.

We end with two new classes: the Courtier and the Officer (which is actually a hybrid of the Courtier and the Fighter -- does the Officer get all the benefits of each at every equivalent level? How do hybrid classes work? This isn't a standard term.). They specialize in running the show for a Name in a domain, and actually require the backing of a Name to be functional. All their different abilities seem well thought-out and functional. I can imagine a player rolling up lots of Courtier NPCs when they need to get things done. It's not obvious, though, that anybody would want to *play* a Courtier or an Officer, or that they could effectively play one and still go on standard D&D adventures. This too is a divisive feature about Eero's work. He's more interested in modelling things, and seeing what happens, than creating a fun and balanced challenge where every listed option is viable. If it turns out that nobody can rack up more than 500 XP as a Courtier, he'll be happy having learned that. Will you be happy having spent a few sessions earning that XP as a Courtier, only to abandon the adventuring lifestyle for three months to oversee bridge construction? (I would, but I'm not everyone.)

In sum, this is an interesting but not totally substantial piece. There are few surprises but a decent amount of advice in an area where most of us are inexperienced. Anybody who was interested in doing a bit (or a lot) of legwork to enrich their domain game could view this as a potential starting-point, and it could complement any number of domain systems.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x120c968a0>,osr,1704502885.0

"""Druid Class"" by Eero Tuovinen -- a review","""Coup de Main in Greyhawk"" is an in-progress campaign and an in-progress rule system by Eero Tuovinen, author of [Muster](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/413382/muster).  He is publishing the design notes for his system in a series of pamphlet-sized PDFs called Coup Workbook Partials, CWPs for short. They are not intended to be immediately playable; they really are *design notes*, useful for spurring further thought in the reader. Two of Coup's design goals are relevant for this review: first, that all character optimization be a matter of fictional positioning, and second, that different magic-using classes play differently.

This is a review of  one of his most recent CWPS, #18, Druid Class. A disclaimer: I got the  PDF for free in exchange for agreeing to review it.

First, the art:

[Back and front cover of CWP 18: Druid Class by Eero Tuovinen](https://preview.redd.it/jgt6xjhsl7hc1.png?width=1389&format=png&auto=webp&s=b60d9f8264212caf2b4a3e46f534ba83f8730874)

I think it's gorgeous, quite evocative. AI-generated, if you care about that, using Stable Diffusion trained on 2e-era TSR art by the writer's brother. The druid's toes are maybe a little too long, but maybe we could read that generously as an effect of his physical cultivation?

The pdf is 28 pages long, of which 4 pages are boilerplate. The remainder are, at a guess, a5, 12 point font, written in Eero's typical breezy style. You could skim through it easily and arrive at a solid grasp of the class, or slow down and really mull things over.

We begin with a three-page summary of the history and organization of the druids and their beliefs. It's not very detailed, just a picture of things. While it's Greyhawk-specific, you shouldn't have trouble understanding how Eero's vision of the druid would or wouldn't fit into your campaign world, and what changes would have to be made. I'm no Greyhawk scholar, but I found the material forceful and game-ready. Though this section, and the later discussion of necromancy and the death force, open a modeling question for the referee: Druids believe *this*, and others believe *that*, but what should the referee believe, and use to model the world? -- Maybe this question can be deferred indefinitely in some cases, but the referee will certainly have to decide if, for instance, there really is a death force, and how the druids have missed it if there is one, and how the necromancers are able to make magic if there isn't one.

The entire next page is devoted to the druid's progression chart. Nothing much sticks out here. There's some Coup-specific idioms, but these can be ignored or pursued further as the reader pleases. I have a quibble with the druid's spell slots, though; as written, they only go up to spell level 4! A druid does have ways to cast spells without slots, so they're not exactly hamstrung by the change. Still, I wonder why Eero chose this spell progression.

Then we spend 5 pages explaining the unique class features of the druid. The organization here is a bit wonky, though it makes sense after the whole document has been read. Each class feature gets a tiny brief, and then, to be expanded upon in the next section, on druidic magic. Until you've read the next section, you won't be able to make heads nor tails of most of this.

A few little comments: I would have liked more information on what having an elemental affinity for life would do for somebody on its own. A druid develops this affinity by becoming a more powerful druid, casting spells, transforming stuff, whatever, but what does a non-druid do with it? Or just a level 1 druid? Is it just a constant ""detect life aura""?

Some of the features are really interesting and cool, and make sense in the (implied and explicit) model. For instance, when a higher-level druid is connected to the stream of life force, they're immune to charm (and falling in love) because their soul is suppressed. Also, such a druid has control over the fate of their spirit after death. They can become a ghost or reincarnate themselves.

Then we get the meat of the document, the explanation of druidic magic. Basically, druids have control over life, just like a fire elementalist has control over fire, but they intentionally restrict themselves to a slow and ""natural"" flow of power. Druids can take a lot of time meditating to transform the living world around them. They can do practically anything that makes sense as an application of ""transforming the flow of the life force"", but if a player wants suggestions for the different maneuvers possible, they can check out the druid's AD&D 1e spell list. Druids can also store these transformations in their spell slots, which they can unleash rapidly, as a normal Vancian caster, though each slot takes one day per spell level to fill. Finally, druids can transform themselves into animals, and there's a quick and easy formula for the difficulty of the procedure.

When druids transform the life stream, they sit in mediation for a while and make a number of concentration checks based on their level and the difficulty of the transformation (and the suggested difficulty is the spell level of the transformation, again, presumably in AD&D 1e). We are not told exactly what a concentration check is; presumably roll d20 under Wisdom? If this is so, druidic magic is extremely dangerous! Any single failure ruins the spell and deals 1d8 damage per spell level, spread between the caster, target, and environment. I want to know what the intended difficulty is here. Should we give bonus dice for a quiet environment or something?

There's a cool discussion of druid politics and ""black druidry"", which is any kind of druidry that doesn't totally align with the normal druidic standards. Basically, treating the life force like a fire elementalist treats fire is bad, as is conspiring with demons and stuff.

We end on a discussion of the druidic social structure, accompanied by a very obscure diagram and some really actionable, game-y material. If a player wants to be a druid and stay on the right side of the white druids, they're going to have to toe the line and dig deep into druidic politics. If not, well, they can always be a black druid, but they'll miss the deep mechanical benefits of druid society and they'll be hunted on sight by white druids.

\### Conclusion

I found this CWP easy to read, evocative, and stimulating. I fully intend to offer it to my play group as the default druid class. There's plenty of blank space in the class design -- my work as the referee will not be ""done"" just because I have read this, and I expect to have to create some understanding of the life stream and elemental magic in my game if I'm going to use it. But I have strong confidence that the rewards will be worth it.

I recommend this to anyone interested in getting their hands dirty with a more in-depth treatment of magic in their game, and anyone who wants an innovative take on a familiar class.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x120cfe690>,osr,1707334549.0

"Review of the greatest OSR Brazilian RPG, OLD DRAGON 2."," 

Hail guys. Old Dragon, the biggest OSR RPG in Brazil., funded last year in 48 minutes, and having achieved several goals. 

It was released in its first edition as an attempt by the creators to have the same experience they had before the bunch of combos brought by 3a. Inspired by the Basic Fantasy experience, the authors independently edited and published a book of 150 pages, with four races, four classes and tools to play up to level 20. It was the first OSR RPG in Brazil and had as its main characteristics: unified save roll, separate races and classes, and specializations (explained later) plus 3rd edition number parameters like stat modifiers 17, +4, and ascending armor classes above 30 for the most epic enemies. 

After 10 or 12 years, changing the way RPGs are written and detecting certain things that could be improved over time, the second edition of this beloved RPG from Brazil was announced, with a unique community in the amount of content produced and collaboration between its members. The new edition was successfully funded in less than an hour (48 minutes) in a crowdfunding format, gaining support from 1322 people, in various digital and physical formats, on FC and Late Pledge. 

The Basic Book is provided free of charge in pdf format, in addition to the SRD being free and easy to consult (<https://olddragon.com.br/livros/srd/>), and the physical hardcover book has an affordable price, much more accessible than the original RPG corebooks in the current edition. 

This analysis aims to analyze the characteristics of the basic book (lLB1), free in pdf, and the expanded rules book (LB2). 

The core book (LB1) has rules up to level 10 Corebook 2, Expanded Rules has rules from level 11 to 15, in addition to dominance rules and mass battles.

OLD DRAGON A RETROGOLEM

Old Dragon is not intended to be a retroclone, but an amalgamation of the best options already presented by several editions of the original Rpg up to advanced 2 in search of the best that one has of this experience in a game. So the core of the system follows this d&d like pattern, and that's why I'm going to talk about what it's different from. Starting with its unique and exclusive concept: Specializations.

SPECIALIZATIONS

Specializations are archetypes that represent different hero concepts than the basic four: fighter, rogue, mage, and cleric, but that fit them. Barbarians are fighters, illusionists are wizards, and assassins are thieves. A specialization streamlines the game and makes its application easier. They share with the base class: hit dice, number of spells per day, number of protection rolls, and have a different XP table, presented in the base class table. So you gain time and agility, in addition to having support from the base class for the creation of any specialization. In the core book we have the barbarians and paladins, as specializations of warriors. Scholar and Druid as cleric specializations; illusionist and necromancer as wizard specs and bards and rangers as thief specs. Specializations can be chosen during character creation and while the character is still at first level.

SEPARATE RACE AND CLASS, BUT WITH THAT STRESS FOR THE RACE AS A CLASS

In addition to all these options, specializations give you enough structure and freedom to create your own, and the ones that caught the most attention in this second edition are the specializations that honor races as a class in the BX and Cyclopedia editions. We have the dwarf adventurer, a warrior specialization exclusive to dwarves, halfling adventurer, thief specialization exclusive to halflings, and elf adventurer, wizard specialization exclusive to elves. Each of these specializations represent, in their honor, the most typical and outstanding examples of their class, with powers and abilities that reflect a classic icon of that class. Want race as a class? Use them. And best of all, they do not exclude the use of other specializations. A group can have an elf adventurer, mixed fighter and mage, and an elf warrior, each with their own focus. There are many, good and meaningful character options.

WARRIORS

Warriors have dv d10, with a +1 attack bonus at each level, to a maximum of +15 at level 15, the game's maximum level. In addition, he has the attractive parry abilities, where he is able to sacrifice a shield or weapon to nullify all damage from a successful attack before the damage is rolled. A true hitting machine, but still deadly, like any old school character.

CLERGY

Clerics have seen a huge improvement in how their skills work. Possessor of divine spells, it can replace any previously memorized spell with Cure Wounds, and besides, here's the best version of warding off undead you'll ever see: When performing the turn undead maneuver, the cleric forces the undead to make a morale check. The morale check, like the classic one, is made in 2d6. If the undead fails andthe results fall in equal numbers (1 and 1, 3 and 3, and etc) the undead turns to dust. Goodbye tables. According to one of the creators, this, in addition to speeding up the game, has probabilities strangely coincident with the classic table, being only necessary to adapt the moral value of the living dead, which was done in the bestiary, the third basic book. DV d8.

WIZARDS

Mage is the most misunderstood class in OSR games. A glass cannon that after firing its shot becomes a 1d4 life fret. To remedy this, mages have more starting spells, plus the ability to Read and Detect Spells, making them more useful overall. DV d4.

THIEF ABILITIES

Following the premise of improving what can be improved, and listening to the community, thieves skills have had their tests changed to d6, in addition to the evolution progression of these skills being customizable. The thief takes 2 to each of his abilities, +2 points, and + his Dexterity modifier as starting points. At levels 3, 6 and 10 he gains 2 more points. The maximum level of a thieves skill is 5, and to succeed on a check requires less than or equal. Ranger and bard have different abilities, but with the same mechanical functioning as the thief since they are archetypes that fit under the umbrella of the thief. The DV of thieves and their specializations is d6.

SAVING THROWS

The saving throws have been merged into 3, and a number related to level and class follows. To this base number we add the Wisdom or Dexterity or Constitution modifiers and we have the three saving throws of their respective attributes. To unify roll under tests, saving throws follow this model, and therefore this value increases across levels. All classes start with the base number 5, and a successful check is achieved by rolling a die and getting a value less than or equal to it.

ARMOR CLASS

Armor class is ascendant, and instead of tables and thaco we have the beautiful BA. Unlike some, to succeed in an attack you must have a result greater than your AC. The draw is on the defense.

RACES

The races have a template similar to the advanced second edition, by more classic standards. They all have some benefit on one of the saving throws, in addition to other classic benefits, such as dwarves hitting ogres and the like easier, elves doing more damage with a bow, and halflings with thrown weapons. As humans are the class that have the fewest benefits, they gain an additional 10% of all XP. 

APPEARANCE, FEATURE AND HISTORY

The core book has solid content, not just the basics of character creation, race, class, equipment, combat, and magic. There is a chapter devoted to providing tables to enrich any character, GM and player alike. These options are further enriched with core book 2, which features more customization options, a more detailed background, and an excellent flashback history option, where we discover the character's background during the game, while also filling out some of the character's skills. character.

FUNCTIONAL LOADING SYSTEM

The load system is intended to maintain the need to manage resources, characteristic of the old school, while making it desirable and as simple as possible. The load system assigns a load value to each object that represents its weight and the difficulty of carrying it. Weapons and armor, take up 1, 2 or 3 charge depending on weight/size. Other equipment takes 1 charge per kilo. Coins occupy every 100 pieces, 1 charge. A character who has a backpack adds +5 to his maximum load. A character's maximum encumbrance rating is the greater of Strength and Constitution. Simple and functional, they did it.

INITIATIVE

Test of wisdom or dexterity. Who passed acts before the enemies. Those who did not pass, act later. Ready. =\]

MOVEMENT IN HEXES

The system features a simple version instead of hex distance calculations. Each character has a movement value, usually 9. This value can decrease due to overload. When the system deals with hex movement scale, it considers that a 6km hex costs x movement points. Each character has their movements in points to travel per day. More difficult terrain costs a greater amount of movement points. So, forget about counting distances. You have 9 movement points to spend, and on this table are the movement costs. What do you do?

TEST ADJUSTMENTS

Tired of consulting what the test modifier is, whether +1, +3, +2 depending on each situation? Your problems are over. All tests have unified settings. The adjustments are: easy +2 on rolls, very easy +5, hard -2, very hard -5. An advantage cancels out a disadvantage. This applies to combat, ability checks, and saving throws. Simple guidelines for arbitrating the argument mentation and narrative development of a task that has significant consequences for the game.

MASTER'S SECTION

This section has extensive solid material for GMs to run their games, especially useful for beginners, and excellent content for reviewing their games based on common sense and fun. Here is the clear adage of ""change the rules if it makes your game more fun"". A generator of dungeons and adventures that make you play easily even without preparation.

MAGIC ITEMS

Not just the classic old school items, but also guidelines and tables for generating new and unique items to surprise those players who have already read everything. 

MONSTERS

The core book features the most iconic classic monsters, plus an exclusive and traditional system: the pygmy fungus and its hair, valuable tobacco herb.

DESIGN NOTES

Throughout the book there are explanatory notes on why the rules are the way they are, how to use or change them to achieve another result, or to tailor the game to your group.

APPENDIX

Here's another shining moment from the book. This index, organized alphabetically, references the rules in both books, the core book and the expanded rule book. So you can pick up any of the books for reference and you'll know where to find what you need, even if it's not in that book.

COMPATIBILITY

Old dragon is directly compatible with everything published up to the second advanced edition of the original roleplaying game. Parameters can be converted but the amounts of power are basically the same. Attribute adjustments have a maximum of +3, the attack bonus has a maximum, for players, of +15, if you are a warrior. The armor class of the strongest creatures goes up to 21. You'll need to convert the club or AC by subtracting 20, and warriors here are real warriors, closer to the advanced version of the original rpg game. With that in mind, it's much easier to convert and take that classic adventure to the table with this system. 

CONCLUSION

For some time Old Dragon had ended their releases. A lot was launched and the public clamored for the compendium, a legendary book never released that would give extra rules, the demand for this book lasted for years and years, it was even written and came out as a B-side document to be downloaded around. However, this additional rule took so long that perhaps it lost its importance, since the game already gave you rules to play up to level 20. In the meantime, everyone had already made do with their house rules The decision to remake the system and rewrite everything based on feedback from players updated the way the system was written. We see that it is the same system, but updated and improved, and with the advantage that the advanced rules have already been released together with the basic book, not missing from the consumer at any time. I plan to touch points in these advanced rules in the future. The main virtues of the system are: solidity and accessibility. The old dragon pdf was always free, if you wanted you could buy the physical book. This one, by the way, always very accessible, showing the publisher's commitment to popularize the hobby. The physical quality of this new edition is impeccable: color illustrations for the most important parts, such as the cover, chapter openings, references to races and classes. It is worth noting that the printing house where it was printed is known for the quality of its products, being the only one in Brazil authorized to print the original rpg books in their fifth edition. Old dragon proposes to provide you with an rpg experience already consolidated by decades of playtest, experience that was lost from the 3rd edition and was never recovered. It does this successfully, however, without being a copy and paste of old systems, but rather, the use and affirmation of those things that have worked for so long, but excluding what never worked (robbery in % for example). The best things from that old gaming experience have been preserved. The worst, removed. And everything in the game is modular, you can change the charge, magic, initiative rule without breaking. Its core has been playtested for over ten years, and changes from the latest version have been through 2 years of playtesting with the community. The system has improved, maintained its virtues: solidity and accessibility, and successfully manages to give you the old-school experience, without philosophizing about the natural nature of the dialectical agency of the emergent narrative of the OSR rpg and giving you, instead, fun, exactly as it used to be.

Doom of the Savage Kings (DCC ﻿#66﻿.5) - Actual play review,"[Originally posted here](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2023/03/doom-of-savage-kings-dcc-665-actual.html). Contains affiliate links and self-promo.

[Doom of the Savage Kings (DCC #66.5)](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/129075/Dungeon-Crawl-Classics-665-Doom-of-the-Savage-King?affiliate_id=403100) is DCC adventure by Harley Stroh (if you don't know DCC, [read this](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2023/01/a-glance-at-basic-d-bx-and-some-clones.html)). Here is the blurb:

>**A Level 1 Adventure**High  above the windswept moors and darksome woods, the village of Hirot is  under siege. Each night, as the sun sinks beneath the western mountains  and the candles burn low, a devil-beast stalks the village streets,  unleashing its savage fury on the living. From warlord to pauper, crone  to child, no one is safe.Defeating  the immortal hound will require more than mere blades or even spells.  To slay the beast, the characters must delve into the mysteries of the  land and its Savage Kings. Only then, armed with relics forged from a  bloody past, can the most cunning and courageous of adventurers  challenge the hound of Hirot!

**Why did I buy/read this?** I find many DCC adventures interesting. So I've gathered some for my [current sandbox](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2022/10/sandbox-quest.html), including this one. I ran it using my [Dark Fantasy Basic](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/229046/Dark-Fantasy-Basic--Players-Guide), which required some mild adaptation.

This  DCC module is somewhat of a classic; I've heard people say good things  about it before, but I hadn't tried it. So I just inserted the village  of Hirot into my sandbox, a few rumors, and the PCs eventually went  there to investigate. 

My players are currently  in the third level. There were three of them, with three first level  hirelings. I changed some stats, but not much. So, while I felt that the  adventure looks hard for 3-4 1st level PCs, I cannot say for sure. This  is not meant as criticism, however; the adventure is fair, and players  with some experience will you avoid some of the worse traps in their way  (and, if they decide to take on a dozen enemies at once, they'll get  their fair ""reward""...).

This is a typical DCC  adventure: cool ideas, good maps, good art, some weirdness and humor. In  fact, it feels a bit less weird than some DCC adventures I ran before:  there's a village, and obvious threat, a small dungeon (in a  barrow-mound), a magic weapon, a witch...  It has a ""classic"" feel,   like a scene straight out of [Three Hearts and Three Lions](https://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2022/11/three-hearts-and-three-lions.html). 

Still,  the bits of weirdness are all interesting, creative and coherent: the  snake-ghouls, the demonic hound, the cursed swamp, and so on. This is  about the right balance between creativity and familiarity for me. 

As  for the adventure structure, it is the ""focused sandbox"" that is common  in modern adventures: the goal is more or less clear, but there are  multiple ways to get there (one of them being obviously more likely).  There are decent amounts of exploration, social interaction, and combat.  There are great creatures, NPCs and traps. There are enough places and  people in 20 pages to create multiple different situations, without ever  putting the PCs in a railroad. Likewise, the dungeon is not linear and  has multiple entrances.

(I must add that I  really like the format and contents of this dungeon - it is clever,  creative, coherent. I had some difficulties understanding the map for a  moment, but that might be just me).

Like most  DCC adventures, each monster and magic item is peculiar: there are no  goblins and skeletons in adjacent rooms, nor simple ""+1 spears"": things  always have a small distinction or two at the very least. Magic items  might be a bit too abundant for 1st-level adventurers, but this is a  dangerous adventure for them, so I think it's fair.

The  only baffling thing about the adventure is one particular scene that  takes less than one page: the PCs get ambushed for no apparent reason,  by NPCs they were, in theory, trying to help - and they also kill their  hirelings automatically, which feels like a cheap shot. A direct  confrontation in these circumstances felt harder than facing the hound  (in my game, the PCs managed to win due to being high level and a failed  morale check, but I don't know if this would be available with 1st  level PCs). It is unclear if there is room to negotiate avoiding  a  fight (the NPCs are willing to surrender), or if it would be possible to  still deal with the village after such a battle. In my games, the PCs  considered simply leaving after that, the village be damned, but  ultimately they decided to face the hound (I would have accepted any  decision, obviously).

I mention this not  because it detracts from the adventure - it doesn't - but only because I  think the DM should think about this specific scene before running the  module.

And, by the end, having a few loose threads might prove very useful for my sandbox...

Overall,  I found this to be an awesome adventure, above average even when  compared to other adventures I've picked because they were specifically  recommended.

**OVERVIEW** ([explanation here](http://methodsetmadness.blogspot.com/2021/02/so-reviews-and-mini-reviews-actual.html)):

**Usable**? Yes! This one is well organized and straightforward.

**Inspiring**? Yes! A bitt less weird than some DCC adventures.

**Bloated**? No. It has the right size.

**Tiresome**? Not at all.

**Clear**? Yes, mostly.

**In short**: As  you can see from the overview, this adventure succeeds in each of my  five criteria. This is probably a first here. DCC adventures are usually  good; this one has a bit more social interaction anb a bit less  weirdness than others. Because of that, it feels like a great adventure  to start a DCC campaign. Definitely **recommended**!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1216e8380>,osr,1679578196.0

"Even if you stick with BX or Old School Essentials (OSE), here are some brief selections of Swords & Wizardry: Complete that you should read. (A Mini-review of SW:C)","I'm sure folks are aware that Swords & Wizardry: Complete (SW:C) offers alternative rules and slightly different system numbers for Old School Dungeons and Dragons play. (Ex: Mass combat, stronghold combat, aerial combat, the one saving throw, etc.) Some are turned off by the layout that's fallen behind today's standards. (Here's hoping the new layout will fix that, and thankfully the referee screen is also going to be available again.) There's something to be taken from SW:C and OD&D you won't get as much of from BX or OSE, though: the Old School DIY spirit.

***The pdf of SW:C is free, but you'd have to read through it to get all the gold nuggets. What follows are a few of those gold nuggets.***

&#x200B;

>…in the 1970s, no group of gamers played precisely the same version of the Original Game anyway. The ‘70s was a decade of freaky improvisation, weird fantasy, and rebellion. And that’s Swords & Wizardry. If that’s how you roll, all the rest is just details.  
>  
>The Swords & Wizardry rules are short compared to the multi-paged rule-libraries required to play most modern role-playing games, yet this game contains within itself all the seeds and soul of mythic fantasy, the building blocks of vast complexity, the kindling of wonder. The Original Game is so powerful because it is encapsulated i n a small formula, like a genie kept imprisoned in the small compass of an unremarkable lamp. Take this framework, and then imagine the hell out of it!  
>  
>Enjoy!  
>  
>Matt Finch

You can see this emphasis on imagination and customization in OD&D:

>There is no reason that players cannot be allowed to play as virtually anything, provided they begin relatively weak and work up to the top, i.e., a player wishing to be a Dragon would have to begin as, let us say, a “young” one and progress upwards in the usual manner, steps being predetermined by the campaign referee...  
>  
>We have attempted to furnish an ample framework, and building should be both easy and fun. In this light, we urge you to refrain from writing for rule interpretations or the like unless you are absolutely at a loss, for everything herein is fantastic, and the best way is to decide how you would like it to be, and then make it just that way! On the other hand, we are not loath to answer your questions, but why have us do any more of your imagining for you? Write to us and tell about your additions, ideas, and what have you. We could always do with a bit of improvement in our refereeing.

Some OD&D aficionados argue that the DIY mindset is reinforced by the sparse rules that require referee ruling on the spot. Others (myself included) would argue that it's better to introduce the DIY mindset after the game and its frame work has been introduced.  BX and OSE provide that introduction to the framework. But while BX and OSE certainly encourage imagination and house ruling, they don't provide as much in the way of inspiration.

Take OSE's description of the fighter, a perfect brief summary:

>Fighters are adventurers dedicated to mastering the arts of combat and war. In a group of adventurers, the role of fighters is to battle monsters and to defend other characters.

Compare it to Finch's long-winded description:

>You are a warrior, trained in battle and in the use of armor and weapons. Perhaps you are a ferocious Viking raider, a roaming samurai, a dashing swashbuckler, a deadly swordswoman, or a chivalrous knight. Whatever type of Fighter you choose to play, you will probably end up on the front lines of your adventuring party—going toe-to-toe with dragons, goblins, and evil cultists, hacking your way through them and taking the brunt of their attacks. The Fighter character is best-equipped of all the character classes to dish out damage and absorb it, too. Clerics heal and Magic-Users cast spells, but the down-and-dirty, hack-and-slash work is generally up to you. You are going to serve as the party’s sword and shield, protecting the weaker party members and taking down the enemies before you. Perhaps one day they will tell legends of your battle prowess, and followers will flock to your castle stronghold where you revel in your fame, riches, and newly earned nobility. Fail, of course, and you will die, just another forgotten warrior in a dangerous world. It should go without saying that female Fighters are as deadly and as skillful as their male counterparts – and in the fantasy worlds of Swords & Wizardry, they are also much more common than in the history of our own world.

This kind of writing is all over the place in SW:C (except for the description of Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings--Finch apparently took it to heart that OD&D's world is to be a human dominated one). Most rule books don't introduce their material this way, which is understandable when everyone knows what a magic-user or a dwarf is. But by going out of his way, Finch provides an example of the kind of wonder you can infuse into the game.

I think Gavin Norman's legacy with OSE is not going to be in OSE itself, but rather in *the idea of such fantastic layout*. After all, these rules are made to be house-ruled half to hell, which makes a reference copy only so useful in the long run. Likewise, I think Finch's legacy with Swords & Wizardry is not the game itself, but the inspiration he provides within. Or, as he puts it: *Imagine the hell out of it!*

***Now, time for some of the less important but still notable quotes from SW:C, what you might call the silver nuggets:***

Finch gives some inspiration for upper level play, including performing wondrous feats of magic:

>Eventually, the more powerful characters will begin to make a mark on the game world itself. They may take control of a castle, build armies, and even, if the game goes on long enough and the group decides not to retire the characters, name kingdoms after themselves or venture into other worlds, realms, or dimensions. Perhaps they will do battle with demon princes, maybe they will forge artifacts of great power—even unite great empires through diplomacy in grand courts or beneath their banners on the field of war. Later “generations” of characters might even be serving as henchmen for the old, retired heroes of the game!...  
>  
>As the characters reach higher levels, the players will most likely want them to begin projects that are not specifically covered by the rules. Perhaps the Magic-User wants to build an army of magically animated iron warriors, but needs to figure out how to do it. Maybe the Fighter wants to establish a small, fortified manor in the wilderness hills, but needs to hire some troops and clear out the area. This side of the game is limited only by your collective imaginations. Of course, as the heroes become better known (or more notorious), they will be petitioned for help by all manner of people from kings to peasants, and they will hear of mysterious places and rumors far beyond the normal fare of less-renowned adventurers.  
>  
>...if you take a look at those spell lists, you will see that the list of 6th-level Magic-User spells includes one called Limited Reincarnation, and the 5th-level Cleric spells include Raise Dead. These are pinnacle-type spells; you do not really need to power them up any further with Reincarnation and Resurrection. So, this author, as a Referee, does not use the higher level spells – at least, not as spells.  
>  
>Instead, all the higher-level spells are treated as the same sort of thing as creating a golem or a cloud castle, or some other type of magical project that would require doing research, finding books, and spending gold. There are books to be found and studied, expensive arcane components to locate, particular times of the year or lunar cycle when the magic can be performed, runes to know, circles to scribe, and other strange and forbidden knowledge to be researched.  
>  
>These things are bigger than mere spells that can be cast multiple times a day. For example, to summon a supernatural being, a Magic-User must use the right magic circle to hold a being of a particular name or type, and that requires research into forbidden tomes, which are likely located in a dungeon or ruin somewhere. To “cast” Resurrection (on someone who has been dead too long for a Raise Dead spell), a Cleric might have to bring the remains to a specific holy place, and seek much more assistance from other Clerics. The possibilities are vast and the author, at any rate, thinks it is more fun to limit the top end of spell power and switch the high-level spells from mere “spells” to serious undertakings of magic, requiring research, adventuring, and the expenditure of huge quantities of gold.

Although never explicitly stated, throughout Finch hints that the game should be run as a good old-fashioned sandbox. The world should be populated with points of interest, and the players should be free to pursue those points of interest at will, or even be allowed to pursue their own interests in the game. Finch also hints at something that he would say explicitly in his Tome of Adventure Design:  *A good adventure should maximize meaningful player decisions.* I'll cheat here, and quote what Finch writes in *Tome:*

>Thus, the cardinal rule of adventure design: seek to maximize the number of meaningful, potentially-informed decisions the players can make during the course of the adventure. By “meaningful,” I mean that the decisions aren’t just trivial options with no real influence on what’s going to happen. And by “potentially-informed,” I mean that the players should have enough information – or the potential to have gotten that information – to make a good decision rather than an arbitrary selection between options. If bad information- gathering or failure to interpret clues is the reason why the players don’t have all the information they need, then that’s their problem – it’s a matter of player skill, and they goofed. But on the other hand, if they play a smart game, brilliantly gathering information and interpreting clues, they should encounter your adventure as a series of choices in which (for the most part) they can use the information to improve their chances of success as they proceed.

There's lots more to talk about in the Tome of Adventure Design, *but that is a post for another day...*

"Review of the Old Dragon 2, the second edition of the first and greatest osr brazilian rpg."," 

Hail guys. Old Dragon, the biggest OSR RPG in Brazil., funded last year in 48 minutes, and having achieved several goals. 

It was released in its first edition as an attempt by the creators to have the same experience they had before the bunch of combos brought by 3a. Inspired by the Basic Fantasy experience, the authors independently edited and published a book of 150 pages, with four races, four classes and tools to play up to level 20. It was the first OSR RPG in Brazil and had as its main characteristics: unified save roll, separate races and classes, and specializations (explained later) plus 3rd edition number parameters like stat modifiers 17, +4, and ascending armor classes above 30 for the most epic enemies. 

After 10 or 12 years, changing the way RPGs are written and detecting certain things that could be improved over time, the second edition of this beloved RPG from Brazil was announced, with a unique community in the amount of content produced and collaboration between its members. The new edition was successfully funded in less than an hour (48 minutes) in a crowdfunding format, gaining support from 1322 people, in various digital and physical formats, on FC and Late Pledge. 

The Basic Book is provided free of charge in pdf format, in addition to the SRD being free and easy to consult (<https://olddragon.com.br/livros/srd/>), and the physical hardcover book has an affordable price, much more accessible than the original RPG corebooks in the current edition. 

This analysis aims to analyze the characteristics of the basic book (lLB1), free in pdf, and the expanded rules book (LB2). 

The core book (LB1) has rules up to level 10 Corebook 2, Expanded Rules has rules from level 11 to 15, in addition to dominance rules and mass battles.

OLD DRAGON A RETROGOLEM

Old Dragon is not intended to be a retroclone, but an amalgamation of the best options already presented by several editions of the original Rpg up to advanced 2 in search of the best that one has of this experience in a game. So the core of the system follows this d&d like pattern, and that's why I'm going to talk about what it's different from. Starting with its unique and exclusive concept: Specializations.

SPECIALIZATIONS

Specializations are archetypes that represent different hero concepts than the basic four: fighter, rogue, mage, and cleric, but that fit them. Barbarians are fighters, illusionists are wizards, and assassins are thieves. A specialization streamlines the game and makes its application easier. They share with the base class: hit dice, number of spells per day, number of protection rolls, and have a different XP table, presented in the base class table. So you gain time and agility, in addition to having support from the base class for the creation of any specialization. In the core book we have the barbarians and paladins, as specializations of warriors. Scholar and Druid as cleric specializations; illusionist and necromancer as wizard specs and bards and rangers as thief specs. Specializations can be chosen during character creation and while the character is still at first level.

SEPARATE RACE AND CLASS, BUT WITH THAT STRESS FOR THE RACE AS A CLASS

In addition to all these options, specializations give you enough structure and freedom to create your own, and the ones that caught the most attention in this second edition are the specializations that honor races as a class in the BX and Cyclopedia editions. We have the dwarf adventurer, a warrior specialization exclusive to dwarves, halfling adventurer, thief specialization exclusive to halflings, and elf adventurer, wizard specialization exclusive to elves. Each of these specializations represent, in their honor, the most typical and outstanding examples of their class, with powers and abilities that reflect a classic icon of that class. Want race as a class? Use them. And best of all, they do not exclude the use of other specializations. A group can have an elf adventurer, mixed fighter and mage, and an elf warrior, each with their own focus. There are many, good and meaningful character options.

WARRIORS

Warriors have dv d10, with a +1 attack bonus at each level, to a maximum of +15 at level 15, the game's maximum level. In addition, he has the attractive parry abilities, where he is able to sacrifice a shield or weapon to nullify all damage from a successful attack before the damage is rolled. A true hitting machine, but still deadly, like any old school character.

CLERGY

Clerics have seen a huge improvement in how their skills work. Possessor of divine spells, it can replace any previously memorized spell with Cure Wounds, and besides, here's the best version of warding off undead you'll ever see: When performing the turn undead maneuver, the cleric forces the undead to make a morale check. The morale check, like the classic one, is made in 2d6. If the undead fails andthe results fall in equal numbers (1 and 1, 3 and 3, and etc) the undead turns to dust. Goodbye tables. According to one of the creators, this, in addition to speeding up the game, has probabilities strangely coincident with the classic table, being only necessary to adapt the moral value of the living dead, which was done in the bestiary, the third basic book. DV d8.

WIZARDS

Mage is the most misunderstood class in OSR games. A glass cannon that after firing its shot becomes a 1d4 life fret. To remedy this, mages have more starting spells, plus the ability to Read and Detect Spells, making them more useful overall. DV d4.

THIEF ABILITIES

Following the premise of improving what can be improved, and listening to the community, thieves skills have had their tests changed to d6, in addition to the evolution progression of these skills being customizable. The thief takes 2 to each of his abilities, +2 points, and + his Dexterity modifier as starting points. At levels 3, 6 and 10 he gains 2 more points. The maximum level of a thieves skill is 5, and to succeed on a check requires less than or equal. Ranger and bard have different abilities, but with the same mechanical functioning as the thief since they are archetypes that fit under the umbrella of the thief. The DV of thieves and their specializations is d6.

SAVING THROWS

The saving throws have been merged into 3, and a number related to level and class follows. To this base number we add the Wisdom or Dexterity or Constitution modifiers and we have the three saving throws of their respective attributes. To unify roll under tests, saving throws follow this model, and therefore this value increases across levels. All classes start with the base number 5, and a successful check is achieved by rolling a die and getting a value less than or equal to it.

ARMOR CLASS

Armor class is ascendant, and instead of tables and thaco we have the beautiful BA. Unlike some, to succeed in an attack you must have a result greater than your AC. The draw is on the defense.

RACES

The races have a template similar to the advanced second edition, by more classic standards. They all have some benefit on one of the saving throws, in addition to other classic benefits, such as dwarves hitting ogres and the like easier, elves doing more damage with a bow, and halflings with thrown weapons. As humans are the class that have the fewest benefits, they gain an additional 10% of all XP. 

APPEARANCE, FEATURE AND HISTORY

The core book has solid content, not just the basics of character creation, race, class, equipment, combat, and magic. There is a chapter devoted to providing tables to enrich any character, GM and player alike. These options are further enriched with core book 2, which features more customization options, a more detailed background, and an excellent flashback history option, where we discover the character's background during the game, while also filling out some of the character's skills. character.

FUNCTIONAL LOADING SYSTEM

The load system is intended to maintain the need to manage resources, characteristic of the old school, while making it desirable and as simple as possible. The load system assigns a load value to each object that represents its weight and the difficulty of carrying it. Weapons and armor, take up 1, 2 or 3 charge depending on weight/size. Other equipment takes 1 charge per kilo. Coins occupy every 100 pieces, 1 charge. A character who has a backpack adds +5 to his maximum load. A character's maximum encumbrance rating is the greater of Strength and Constitution. Simple and functional, they did it.

INITIATIVE

Test of wisdom or dexterity. Who passed acts before the enemies. Those who did not pass, act later. Ready. =\]

MOVEMENT IN HEXES

The system features a simple version instead of hex distance calculations. Each character has a movement value, usually 9. This value can decrease due to overload. When the system deals with hex movement scale, it considers that a 6km hex costs x movement points. Each character has their movements in points to travel per day. More difficult terrain costs a greater amount of movement points. So, forget about counting distances. You have 9 movement points to spend, and on this table are the movement costs. What do you do?

TEST ADJUSTMENTS

Tired of consulting what the test modifier is, whether +1, +3, +2 depending on each situation? Your problems are over. All tests have unified settings. The adjustments are: easy +2 on rolls, very easy +5, hard -2, very hard -5. An advantage cancels out a disadvantage. This applies to combat, ability checks, and saving throws. Simple guidelines for arbitrating the argument mentation and narrative development of a task that has significant consequences for the game.

MASTER'S SECTION

This section has extensive solid material for GMs to run their games, especially useful for beginners, and excellent content for reviewing their games based on common sense and fun. Here is the clear adage of ""change the rules if it makes your game more fun"". A generator of dungeons and adventures that make you play easily even without preparation.

MAGIC ITEMS

Not just the classic old school items, but also guidelines and tables for generating new and unique items to surprise those players who have already read everything. 

MONSTERS

The core book features the most iconic classic monsters, plus an exclusive and traditional system: the pygmy fungus and its hair, valuable tobacco herb.

DESIGN NOTES

Throughout the book there are explanatory notes on why the rules are the way they are, how to use or change them to achieve another result, or to tailor the game to your group.

APPENDIX

Here's another shining moment from the book. This index, organized alphabetically, references the rules in both books, the core book and the expanded rule book. So you can pick up any of the books for reference and you'll know where to find what you need, even if it's not in that book.

COMPATIBILITY

Old dragon is directly compatible with everything published up to the second advanced edition of the original roleplaying game. Parameters can be converted but the amounts of power are basically the same. Attribute adjustments have a maximum of +3, the attack bonus has a maximum, for players, of +15, if you are a warrior. The armor class of the strongest creatures goes up to 21. You'll need to convert the club or AC by subtracting 20, and warriors here are real warriors, closer to the advanced version of the original rpg game. With that in mind, it's much easier to convert and take that classic adventure to the table with this system. 

CONCLUSION

For some time Old Dragon had ended their releases. A lot was launched and the public clamored for the compendium, a legendary book never released that would give extra rules, the demand for this book lasted for years and years, it was even written and came out as a B-side document to be downloaded around. However, this additional rule took so long that perhaps it lost its importance, since the game already gave you rules to play up to level 20. In the meantime, everyone had already made do with their house rules The decision to remake the system and rewrite everything based on feedback from players updated the way the system was written. We see that it is the same system, but updated and improved, and with the advantage that the advanced rules have already been released together with the basic book, not missing from the consumer at any time. I plan to touch points in these advanced rules in the future. The main virtues of the system are: solidity and accessibility. The old dragon pdf was always free, if you wanted you could buy the physical book. This one, by the way, always very accessible, showing the publisher's commitment to popularize the hobby. The physical quality of this new edition is impeccable: color illustrations for the most important parts, such as the cover, chapter openings, references to races and classes. It is worth noting that the printing house where it was printed is known for the quality of its products, being the only one in Brazil authorized to print the original rpg books in their fifth edition. Old dragon proposes to provide you with an rpg experience already consolidated by decades of playtest, experience that was lost from the 3rd edition and was never recovered. It does this successfully, however, without being a copy and paste of old systems, but rather, the use and affirmation of those things that have worked for so long, but excluding what never worked (robbery in % for example). The best things from that old gaming experience have been preserved. The worst, removed. And everything in the game is modular, you can change the charge, magic, initiative rule without breaking. Its core has been playtested for over ten years, and changes from the latest version have been through 2 years of playtesting with the community. The system has improved, maintained its virtues: solidity and accessibility, and successfully manages to give you the old-school experience, without philosophizing about the natural nature of the dialectical agency of the emergent narrative of the OSR rpg and giving you, instead, fun, exactly as it used to be.

Death In Space player-sourced review,"I bought Death In Space a week ago and it finally arrived yesterday. I was so engaged I fell asleep reading about the star system it’s set in (that sounds like a diss but it’s not, I usually don’t read RPG books before bed these days).
First of all, I presented it to my players and they love everything about the book. They said a lot about the feeling of the setting- one guy said he really liked the way all the equipment, food, and expenses are located right on the inside cover, another guy said the same about the basic rules on the back inside cover. OSR folks really do not waste any part of the buffalo book.
What people in my group agree is the best are how quickly character creation can go with the random generator online. They also came to a consensus that the frailty of their characters is an excellent change of pace, especially coming from 5e where you often become a demigod at some point between level 14 and 20. 
Our first randgen had -1 BDY, -3 DEX, -3 SVY, and -2 TEC. We call him Fiddle Porter, The Boy Who Sucked (like really sucked). And best of all no one was angry; it was just the cosmic hand the player was dealt.
We’re going to play a session when we have time. People in my group absolutely love the premise and the vibe… and the very weak characters who will be dying in space a lot.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1217dfda0>,osr,1673096680.0

The Stygian Library - New vs Old Comparison & Review,"[Video Flipthrough](https://youtu.be/0fEEd022tm4)

**Comparison and Review: New vs Old - The Stygian Library**

*by PM Schramm*

The remaster.  The ultimate chance to fix past mistakes and relaunch a product with modern sensibilities while incorporating the lessons learned into a finished deliverable, all while being paid to do it.  It sounds like a dream come true, as long as your initial product drew enough interest that funding a remaster is feasible. *The Stygian Library* definitely fits this criteria.  The self-proclaimed “dungeon for bibliophiles” by Emmy Allen has been lauded since its launch for the creativity and unique location it brings to a tabletop game.  The highly variable tables within promise a unique experience every time it’s delved.

But, with a remaster comes certain expectations.  Improvements.  Simply rereleasing the same product already available can burn through goodwill extremely quickly, and being accused of making a “money grab” is a real possibility.  Thankfully, *The Stygian Library* doesn’t fall into this category.  The remaster is definitely an improvement over the original; however, does it do enough?  Let’s begin by examining its predecessor.

## Look, Feel, and Space Utilization

The original release of this random dungeon generator was available from DriveThruRPG and, as is usual from their print-on-demand products, the softcover end result isn’t anything to write home about.  The paper is thin, the printing is blurry, the binding is glued, and the interior covers are not printed.  Overall, as a beat-around copy you’d use at the table - which this product is really designed for - it’s passable.  I would not be uncomfortable writing my own notes and fixing the grammatical errors I found in the margins of this booklet.  Speaking of grammatical errors, looking at the rear cover gives you an idea of what can be expected within *The Stygian Library*, both from a content, and writing style point of view:

> *“Sufficient Knowledge twists the world around it into strange shapes. This, then, is the Stygian Library…a creepily genteel dungeon set in an infinite extradimensional library. Each expedition generates its route as it explores, resulting in new locations being is covered* [sic] *with every visit…It’s a big spooky library full of dangerous knowledge, spiritual automata and ghost-fuelled computers. Designed for low to mid power levels, and suitable for use with most old-school systems with a little adaptation.”*

The book mostly delivers on the promises found on the rear.  It has a middling layout with well-placed pictures and no text creeping from one page to the next.

## Content

Opening the work we find a title page, followed by a copyright page.  Next is an extremely busy table of contents that is hard to parse.  The only benefit to this page is that the tables are italicized, finding anything else at a glance is impossible.  Even the titles and page numbers sometimes take up two lines.  Following this is an introduction page that gives some insight into what inspired the module and what systems it was designed for/using.  From there, we dive into the meat of the adventure.  This begins with the rules on running it.

Located on page 7, this section really would benefit from a play example and referenced page numbers because, as written, it’s a bit confusing.  Things that are referenced haven’t been revealed to the reader yet and an introductory section that gives you insight into the library (for example, the “Events” section located on page 8) would have set the stage much better.  Overall, this book’s layout is out of order, and the excuse listed in the intro to “read the whole book cover to cover a few times” is a bit of a cop-out.  Continuing on, the rules for running blindly aren’t explained clearly.  When running, the referee is supposed to roll a 1d4-1 to determine how much deeper the party ends up, exploding and stepping up die sizes if a max value roll is the result.  But, no reference to a result of 0 is given, and staying on the same level of the library isn’t a real option based on the other rules.  My suggestion to those running the module would be to simply re-roll 1s to avoid 0s, but the author’s intent is unclear.

Perhaps these specific rules are buried in the prose somewhere, but finding them can be a bit of a challenge as, while no text carries from one page to the next, this is sometimes to the layout’s detriment, as displayed on page 11 in a wall of writing.  Even in black and white, there would have been some options to help distinguish important information to discern at a glance, but this opportunity wasn’t taken through much of the adventure, including shading alternating table entries like could have been leveraged on pages 14 and 15.

## Usability

The usability issues for *The Stygian Library* continue through much of the booklet.  For example, one glaring issue is seen at the bottom of every page.  The graphics are blurry.  This could just be an issue with DriveThru’s printer; however, in addition to the blurriness the font choice for the page numbers is extremely small and hard to read.  In a book you’re going to be using at the table, the ease of flipping around to find tables and other entries is a crucial piece of the puzzle that was overlooked.  Granted, when flipping through, your brain has the tendency to fill in the gaps for numbers you can't actually read, but I’m fairly confident more than a few people will have an issue locating things with the page number graphics selected.

Another issue is shown next in the locations: the order they’re listed in appears to be the order they were written in, rather than in an alphabetical or logical order.  This makes it impossible to find something without looking it up first on page 13.  Better yet, the locations should be numbered, which would allow a clever referee to forgo looking up anything at all on the Locations table, as they could simply roll the die and find the result within the book if they so choose.

Rounding out the remainder of the booklet there are a few more grammatical and usability errors, for example the fact that throughout the text sometimes the page numbers for certain Librarians are listed, and sometimes they are not.  You may ask, “What are Librarians?”  The answer is they’re an important part to this dungeon as they make the whole thing work.  They’re listed at the rear of the module, in the bestiary section, far later than when it would have been preferred to learn about them.  It’s only one page, moving it to the beginning, near the intro, would have been a good design choice.

# The Remaster

There are more than a few areas that could have used improvement in the original *Stygian Library* - let’s look at the new release.  The first thing that’s immediately apparent is a drastic improvement in printing quality moving away from DriveThruRPG.  In addition, moving to an offset also grants the ability to leverage the interior covers for the printing of the tables used most often, a great advantage to a procedurally-generated dungeon!  Unfortunately, Allen opted not to use the interior covers for this purpose, but to instead display very basic artwork.  The reason why this decision was made is unclear.  The remaster has no additional functionality improvements in its form compared to its predecessor outside of a ribbon bookmark.  That’s a huge missed opportunity in this reviewer’s eyes.  At least the rear cover is now clear of grammatical errors.

Opening the adventure reveals a title page, a vastly improved table of contents, and then the introductory section. This is where the first differences in the interior text are noted. While the majority of the text and writing is the same, the references to *Lamentations of the Flame Princess* and *Swords & Wizardry* as particular systems used in the testing and writing of the module are now excluded, keeping instead the simple statement, “This was written & tested using a weird mishmash of OSR systems.” In addition, the mention of *A Red and Pleasant Land* by Zak S. was excluded from the section where the book’s inspiration is listed.

There are a few other changes here and there, some of which involves the addition of typos such as the space between “Somebody must have died there” and its period on page 9, but overall the format is much better and much less wall-of-textish.  Another example showing improvement is the cleanliness of the “How to Run” section on page 10.  The use of fonts and bolding is effective, something the previous iteration of this module did not leverage; that said, the time to revise the rules to provide clarity - specifically on the “Running Blindly” section previously noted - was disappointingly not taken.

This is the net result and my main gripe of the remaster.  Most of the writing and information is exactly the same with only a few slight tweaks and a better, but not great, layout.  For example, migrating the Librarians to the front wasn’t done because that’s how the original was laid out and the remaster doesn’t deviate a lot from its previous incarnation.  Even though the Librarians are so important and it makes much more sense to put them directly after the section they’re first mentioned in on page 18, they’re still near the end of the book on pages 112-115.  A remaster is supposed to be a reimagining of your previous work, a chance to fix and shore up the areas that needed improvement.  *The Stygian Library* didn’t take this opportunity.

All the included tables are the same compared to their previous versions, excluding the removal of the “don’t add depth” rule from the original encounter tables.  This is either something that was supposed to be added and simply wasn’t or was the only rules change included in the remaster.  This author’s guess is the former, especially considering the error for results >20 on the dreams and rumors tables on pages 132 and 142, but as-is it’s not necessarily a negative.  The change makes multiple re-rolls possible and boosts the average result higher.  The tables look much better, but once again the results don’t have their numbers listed on their respective pages.  At least they’re alphabetized this time, which makes it a bit easier to navigate, but *why aren’t these tables on the interior covers?*

More slight issues abound: the b on *B****one Beast*** on page 49 is missing its bolding and the events table on page 24 should have when to roll a d20 vs a d12 listed here, rather than on page 13 where it could be missed. The encounter tables on the subsequent pages include clarifications, there should be some here too.

## Conclusion

Overall, *The Stygian Library* remaster is, to put it simply, a missed opportunity.  The original needed more than just a fresh coat of paint.  It had some issues and errors that should have been addressed that weren’t, and the new format added issues that should have been caught in the editing stage.  Some of these errors are downright lazy, epitomized by the error on page 139. “I Search the Body” result #28: Book (Roll on the Types of Books Table [ppxx]).  Simply Ctrl+Fing for the obvious placeholder text [ppxx] during the layout stage or in the completed pdf before sending the book off to print would have caught this blunder, but no one thought to do it.

If you don’t own this adventure yet you want the remaster.  If you own the original is it worth it to buy the new one?  You make that call.  It certainly does look better sitting on your shelf.

Which OSR works best as a 3.0/3.5e replacement?,"Hello everyone, 

I am a forever DM and since my players always played 3.5 thats what I am stuck with.  
As a consequence I only play dnd 3.5 level lock games Lv6-8. Everything above that is just way too much work for me as a DM.

I read a bit into other systems too. PF2e, 5e, Conan, Worlds woithout number, OSR, fate...

One of my players has a huge library of old dnd 3.0-3.5e adventures that we would still like to use.  
  
**So what I am looking for is a system that creates less work for me as a DM compared to 3.5 but has also a better design (buff stacking, imbalance etc) while making it easy to adapt 3.0e or 3.5e adventures into it.**

Is there a system that fits that idea? Basically, a reworked rule set of the old 3.0 to be more modern in general? Which one would you pick?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x121862f60>,osr,1741514115.0
