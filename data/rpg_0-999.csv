4wuhj4,"I figured out why I hated Suicide Squad so much; it was like watching a superhero themed RPG, played by all of the most annoying players ever.","Suicide Squad spoilers ahoy:

...

...

...

First of all, they all decided to play neutral/evil characters, despite the DM announcing a superhero themed game with a heroic plot. DM allows it for some reason, attempts to tweak the setup to allow it on the fly by making them beaten supervillains working for reduced prison sentences.

Deadshot is the one player actually attempting to take it seriously, even going so far as to give his character a back story. He tries his best, but he's not that good at improvising dialogue, so he winds up throwing out cheesy one liners that totally kill whatever atmosphere they've managed to cultivate. 

Flag is the buddy of the DM's that doesn't really play, but agreed to play the PC with the relationship with the BBEG to give the plot a hook, but only if he could play a ""normal"" guy as a character cause he thinks the rest of the group is a bunch of nerds.

Harley Quinn is the only girl at the table. Not actually there to play, just interested in getting attention from the male players by playing a really sexual character, but also acts like a total loon to keep them from getting any ideas that she's genuinely interested in them. 

Joker is the NPC the DM invented on the fly to try and keep Harley's player invested in the game. She doesn't care, and he winds up being a total mess of a character with all of the subtlety of a dump truck.

El Diablo is the guy who refuses to do anything to contribute to the success of the party in combat, because of reasons involving his character being tragic and edgy. When the others call him out, he shrugs and says, ""It's just what my character would do.""

Killer Croc is the guy browsing 4chan on his phone the whole time, looking up only to roll for an attack and say, ""Uh, yeah, I, uh...I'm a lizard guy. I eat people."" before going back to his phone.

Slipknot was the guy who tries to break the setting by going against the plot for no reason. DM kills him out of frustration, the player gets pissed and goes home. 

Captain Boomerang is actually a pretty decently built character, but his player gives him a pink unicorn fetish and an Australian accent to piss off the DM. Keeps bringing it up at weird times.

Katana is that weird guy who's SUPER into anime. Insists on playing a girl, and got all of his attributes from some weird Asian themed rulebook he ordered online from Europe that is actually for a different game. Again, DM allows it for some reason. Refuses to speak English during any roleplay.

The entire plot of the movie, from the Enchantress easily stealing the idol with her brother in it from Viola Davis, to the bland generic minions, to the evil sexy wiggling before the final battle, to every superhero movie cliché, is the DM trying out that homebrew game he wrote that he was super excited about, then realizing as it goes on that he is actually woefully unprepared and the party is not working with him, so he proceeds to phone it in and just get it to be over with so he can go write Version 2.

The soundtrack is the DM's iPod on shuffle in the background. Is actually the MVP of the game.

EDIT: So people are right, Harley and Katana should be switched, Katana is a girl super into anime, Harley is actually a guy playing a psycho chick. But I'm not changing it, so just imagine whichever is funnier, IDGAF.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2808d0ad0>,rpg,1470719082.0

Gaming In your 20s.  

GM: As you gracefully guide your ship into the Starport on Gateway Station you can see the throngs of people through the giant viewports placed all along the station’s hull.  You settle onto the platform of your small landing bay.  The large blast doors slowly open, and you can see a dozen techs going about their business.  The air has the acrid smell of ozone and a dozen industrial fluids as ships are inspected and serviced. 

Players one and two: We put on our armor and weapons and head for the cantina.  We’re on alert in case we’re ambushed.   

Player three: I hack into the system and try to take control of the station security computer so I can monitor the situation. 

Player four: I stealthily place explosives all around the landing bay in case we’re attacked. 

Player five: I have a list of illegal performance enhancing drugs I need, so I’ll head for medbay and ask around.

71ztjs,RPGs and creepiness,"So, about a year ago, I made a post on r/dnd about how people should avoid being creepy in RPGs. By creepy I mean involving PCs in sexual or hyper-violent content without buy-in from the player. I was prompted to post this because someone had posted a ""worst RPG stories"" thread and there was a disturbing amount of posts by women (or men recounting the stories of their friends or girlfriends) about how their PC would be hit on or raped or assaulted in game. I found this really upsetting. 

What was more upsetting was the amount of apologetics for this kind of behavior in the thread. A lot of people asked why rape was intrinsically worse than murder. This of course was not the point. I personally cannot fathom involving sexual violence in a game I was running or playing in, but I'm not about to proscribe what other players do in their make believe universe. The point was about being socially aware enough to not assume other players are okay with sexual violence or hyper-violence, or at the very least to be seek out buy-in from fellow players. This was apparently some grotesque concession to the horrid, liberal forces of political correctness or something, because I got a shocking amount of push-back.

But I stand by it. Obviously it depends a lot on how well you know your group, but I can't imagine it ever hurting to have some mechanism of denoting what is on and off the table in terms of extreme content. Whether it be by discussing expectations before hand, or having some way of signaling that a line that is very salient to the player is being crossed as things unfold in-game. 

In the end, that post told me a lot about why some groups of people shy away from our hobby. The lack of awareness and compassion was dispiriting. But some people did seem to understand and support what I was saying.

Learning the controls was sooo hard. I don't want to go through that again. This is taking up half of my hard drive space, anyways.""

Combat is boring, finding random equipment is cheesy and there's too much level scaling. I wish there were different quests, too.""  

You show them the glory that is NexusMods. You show them how every issue they have with the game has been analyzed and potentially fixed by someone else by now. You don't even need to mod it yourself, because people package this stuff so you can download it all through Wabbajack all good to go!  

""But what about Bethesda's vision? They own The Elder Scrolls after all. I want to play Bethesda-approved, official Skyrim only. Not someone else's idea of it."" ...OK, their loss.  

You show them that there are entirely different games, that offer experiences similar to Skyrim, but fundamentally different. Your first friend's arguments start to crop up. These other loot-dungeon-talk-man games are simply too different from Skyrim for them to be interested.

t2thd7,"Playing D&D In Ukraine, We Are All Completely Fine","**Morning**. Is the curfew still in effect? Does anyone know? Okay, there are people in the streets - probably okay to come out.

Looking for bandages for the volunteer corps. Closed store, closed store, here's one that's opened (going to close in half an hour) - sorry, no bandages, all sold out.

Eureka! We've got the large medkit I've bought a couple years ago, with enough bandages for a bus full of passengers. Large medkit, now is your time to serve the Ukrainian people.

**Noon**. Okay, we have water, we have powerbanks, there are three shelters nearby. Let's grab some snacks.

Wow, there's bread at the supermarket!

**D&D**. Everyone looks at their phones. I DM and I don't mind, partially because I'm looking at my phone where a guy from Poland writes to me about the help that goes our way and also sends me jokes about Putin. I like that guy.

""Okay, let's roll on the encounter table... wow. A 20. Just as you finish breaking the statue, you notice a woman wearing a heavy grey cloak. She's heading your way. She's accompanied by two enormous wolves"".

""What do we know about werewolves? I've rolled a 6!""

""You know they're invulnerable to any normal weapon"".

""Have we got anything silver?""

""N-n-nope"".

""Hey guys, check this out! The roms have stolen another russian tank!""

""No way!""

""Hey, I can easily believe it"".

""So, those werewolves... fine, let's take a break"".

**Half an hour talking about war and how proud we are of the country and how the whole world suddenly decided to pay attention to what's happening. Then back to D&D.**

""I cast a spell on the wolves... are they immune to all magic?""

""Only to the spells that damage them"".

""Fine! I cast an illusion to make them see me as their mistress"".

Roll roll

""The first wolf sniffs your face. The second... make a roll... oh"".

""What? What?!""

""The second wolf sniffs your butt"".

The room quickly fills with suggestions about how to treat this situation, interrupted by another story about the stolen tank. Turns out the romani didn't steal it, they merely took it apart. Then they stole a heavy truck that was following the tank.

""I raise my axe, and strike at the woman when she turns her back!""

""Wow. A crit. Oh, wow. The axe of the One True King flashes as it strikes, and the witch falls with a shriek of pain"".

""The old psycho threatens the whole world with nuclear weapons now"".

""Eh, he's bluffing"".

""He's a cornered rat and he's a psychopath, he'll do anything"".

""That's what he wants everyone to believe"".

""Is the wolf that sniffs his butt male or female?""

**Afternoon**.

The battle ends, everyone survived (including the wolves), those who live in the other part of city have to leave now to get home before curfew.

""Thanks. Fun time. Same time next week?""

""Uh huh, next week we're gonna play Fallout - then we'll get inside and play D&D"".

""Ha! Good one"".

""So, next Sunday?""

""Yeah, things will be back to normal next Sunday"".

""Absolutely"".

I would've loved to write a review of the module we played, The Grey Fortress (following The Inquisitors' Road), but frankly, no one could pay attention to the game, even with werewolves sniffing their bottoms. But we had fun, we laughed, we were glad to be together.

ih97hd,Roleplaying is not voice acting.,"Hey everyone!

I have been a DM for D&D 5e for two years now. I'm generally someone who prefers roleplaying more than combat or exploration in my games. I often get into a situation where players tell me that they can't roleplay because they're not good at coming up with a good quip or an appropriately toned response to a fellow player or an NPC and I always assure them that's not what roleplaying means to me. In my tables, if a player wants to engage in a roleplaying scenario and behave in a certain way then they can just tell me what they're saying and how they're character is behaving while saying that and I'll treat it the same. 

This seems like a fairly common sense thing to do and props to you if you're a player or GM who does this. In my case it took me a while before I realized that this was a route I could take. I came from a theatre background and one of my earliest benchmarks for good roleplaying came from critical role so I was hooked in the acting and voice modulation they did. I only changed my ways when I came across a player who very earnestly thought they'd suck at the game if that's what roleplaying implied. Once I started running my games with more descriptive roleplaying, I've seen so much more active involvement from my players as a whole and never felt like I missed out on anything. In fact some of the best roleplaying experiences I've had as a DM was with that very same player who was not confident about their roleplaying ability.

This can also help your players feel more badass/skilled/smart depending on the scenario. Imagine getting your campaign to the point where your players have turned into champions commanding an army and one of them has to make a speech to rally the troops. If your player can come up with a speech that can rival Theoden (Lotr) on the spot then great! However, if your player can also describe a speech with the things they want to say and the effect they want it to have then that should be just as great! 

This also applies to the GM as well.  If you want to roleplay a menacing character who is deceptively charming and terrifying for your players then you shouldn't feel limited or let down by the stuff you can do with your voice or actions. You'll be able to achieve the same mental image by just using good descriptions.

Apologies if I'm late to the party and this is fairly common sense for everyone by now but I hope that it helped someone.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x282a21430>,rpg,1598481672.0

12uclyd,The weirdest thing to ever happen to me as a TTRPG designer.,"Here's a story of the strangest message I've ever gotten, and how it led to the most weird and wonderful thing I've ever done in the tabletop world. Two months ago, I got a short message on Twitter from an account I'd never interacted with. It read:

>Hello Kurt, we are an amusement museum located near Niagara Falls NY interested in having an event around your new TTRPG.

No further details other than a request for contact info.

So I'm intrigued, obviously. I love museums (the more niche the better). It wasn't a totally crazy message -- this was just before the release of [*Here We Used to Fly*](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/refling/here-we-used-to-fly), my game about abandoned theme parks and the bittersweet nostalgia of growing up. Part of me wondered if a curator had googled ""theme park game"" and found my weird TTRPG without knowing what it was. Which would be kind of a disaster because *Here We Used to Fly* is not only a weird imagination game, it's a weird, diceless, sometimes sad imagination game.

I showed my my dad and he thought it was a scam. But what kind of scam is so... specific? And even if it was the world's strangest scam, I had to know more.

I sent the museum an email with a pre-release copy of the game. I explained what it was and offered to help in any way that I reasonably could. I figured there was a decent chance that they would see what the game was and politely backpedal... but the message I got back was not what I expected at all.

They'd *already played the game*. Multiple staff members *backed the Kickstarter*. The museum is on the site of a real, historic carrousel factory. They have a WORKING 1916 CARROUSEL. The staff wanted people to **come roleplay amidst their exhibits**, and they made a big pitch to their board about how cool this would be. They asked me to come, too. (They're even paying me to be there, which is wild for a tiny museum.)

How could I say no to that?

And so, thanks to the passion of the Herschell Carrousel Museum staff, I get to both play pretend and ride century old ponies on May 20 near Buffalo New York. If you told me this was going to happen when I started designing games, I would not have believed you.

Feeling very grateful.

**EDIT:** A helpful commenter says I should link the event! Fair, haha. It's a playthrough that happens across the museum grounds, then a Q&A with me and my co-designer. [You can pick up a ticket here](https://herschell-carrousel-factory-museum.square.site/product/amusement-rpg-night-here-we-used-to-fly/1270?cp=true&sa=false&sbp=false&q=true) if it sounds like your kind of thing.

4rcdpz,How to play an elven character when you are not an elf: a guide,"-Interrupt people, especially non-elves. Your opinions are the most important in the room.

-Likewise, take care to explain things to non-elven party members even when they have vastly more skill ranks than you, as they will benefit from your years of experience  (in the parlance, this is known as “elfsplaining”).

-A good idea from a non-elf may be rewarded with a simple “But of course” or an “As I was about to say”.

-Sit cross-legged often.

-It is acceptable to exclude non-elves from a discussion or plan by having your discourse only in elven. Companions who wish to participate will spend the time required to learn the language. When they do this, it is your duty to correct their grammar.

-If you absolutely must use the common tongue, make your displeasure at doing so clear.

-Non-elves require eight hours of rest per night, rather than the usual four. Keep yourself occupied in the extra time with elven activities such as reading elven literature, writing poetry or crafting masterworked arrows.

-It is the responsibility of party members who lack lowlight vision to bring adequate light sources. If they are not prepared enough for a moonlit forest, they are not prepared enough to be adventuring with the likes of you.

-Non-elves often have poor hygiene, and some go for days on end unwashed in armor. When dealing with a smelly companion, it is best to use prestigitation to give them or their equipment a pleasant lavender scent. If you cannot cast cantrips, a decade or so in a reputable wizard college should confer this ability on you.

-The bow is the weapon of the true warrior. Except when it is the blade. Or magic. Always insist that your speciality is inherently superior to any other, and argue at length.

-Elves are naturally superior archers, wizards and warriors. This is because they were created before the younger races, when the world was more primal, and only the best archers, wizards and warriors would have survived, becoming the progenitors of the elven race. The young races, by comparison, thrive on mediocrity in the soft modern world. 

-Other people’s dietary choices are offensive. Make sure to remind them constantly.

-If a companion cannot seem to comprehend your words, it is best to use expressive sighs to communicate with them.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x282dd4290>,rpg,1467720900.0
2n952n,The Fighter decided to ask our Wizard why he needs gold to cast a spell on some boots.,"What follows is paraphrased from the best answer I've ever heard by a party wizard to such a simple question.

""*sigh*…Because gold *is* magic. The first day I was an apprentice, I remember my Maestro asked me the simple question, 'Why can’t we create gold?' I thought it was an odd question, but as he left me alone to think about it, I realized I’d heard of wizards creating fire, summoning water, producing force, and all sorts other of objects and effects… but never of a Wizard just sitting in a tower summoning mounds of gold. You’d think if it was possible, *someone* would’ve done it by now right? Well…why haven’t they? 

It’s because gold *is* magic. Well, a physical manifestation and metaphysical conduit at the same time, but for your purposes, it *is* magic. I mean, when you sit and look at the evidence laid out, how could you not have come to the conclusion sooner? Let’s take, oh…dragons, for example. When you imagine a big bad dragon, the next thing you imagine is it guarding its’ hoard. Hoard of what you say? Oh, that’s right, GOLD. Doesn’t it strike you as a little odd that an entity whose literal being is infused with magic just happens to have not only an insatiable, but uncanny magnetism towards large quantities of gold, along with the urge to acquire as much as possible? Possibly Like-Begets-Like, mayhaps? 


What about Dwarves? This is a race whose history lies below ground, closest in proximity to the veins and shafts where gold accumulates and grows (Yes, I said grows). Also the only natural race with a strange resistance to magic. Interesting, wouldn’t you say? Almost as if there’s a subtle inoculation against it by such proximity for generations…

Lastly, to get back to what exactly I am doing with all this gold when I’m making your lovely magic item, or all my scrolls…You’re right that I’m not spending thousands of coins upon jewels and masterwork items to hold the magic in place. That’s ludicrous, but if eldritch manipulators are spending money on high end items to imbue, it’s probably a personal focusing preference. For myself though, as you can see, I am working with normal mundane items. As to the details, first I am transmogrifying via prestidigitation these elegant golden coins into their more metaphysically soluble powder form because essence diffusion is easier by an order of magnitude when working with particulates instead of a boatload of Big Ol’ Coins. Next, with a certain amount of forceful application of will and choice incantations, you will notice the gold powder I am sprinkling and kneading on top of the object appears to be being absorbed. Remember what I said about manifestation and conduit? So the gold is not only priming these boots to be receptive towards my spells, but it’s starting to establish a channel to arcane ley lines it order to keep the magic going. And yes, it is indeed very time consuming rubbing gold powder into an item one pinch at a time while maintaining the proper mental focus. There’s a REASON it takes us about eight hours for every thousand gold a magic item requires. You think a consortium of magic users got together and decided on union hours for magic making? Hell no. Its plain, old, tedious, but important work if you want it to function correctly.

Now, master-of-arms and all things armly, would you kindly let me focus on the task at hand so that when I’m done, we don’t have to worry about our Holy Dictator suffering from extreme vomiting and nausea whenever he puts his shoes on because I had to split my attention trying to condense decades of intense arcane study into an elementary discourse?""",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x282e655e0>,rpg,1416826196.0
k2il4g,"I ""meet"" a friend who died years ago through his old sheet","Hi guys. It happened a few hours ago and I wanted to talk about it. I've been playing RPG since 2009, when I was 8 years old. As I lived in a small town, the number of friends with whom I could share this interest was minimal and access to the material was almost impossible. We imagined characters with strengths and weaknesses and we had our adventures using just a few 6-sided dice and imagination, long before we got a Dragão Brazil (the biggest RPG magazine in our country) or something. At that time, the closest friend I had in this RPG little group was Saulo. Saulo was a nice guy and in the first Dragão Brasil we got, he fell in love with the Paladin class. Since then, G'Rainklir, the Goblin Paladin (he liked irony) has spread justice over Arton, armed with his club and shield.The players came and go, but the constant of having me as GM and Saulo as a Paladin never changed, even when he moved to the state capital. Even after we grew up, started in high school and all that, vacation was RPG time. All of this went very well until the end of 2015, Saulo was diagnosed with leukemia. It was a shit, a very, very, very terrible shit. He was the soul of the group, the guy who always had a joke on the tip of his tongue and was never discouraged by anything, in the game or in life. The doctors said they didn't have much to do, the disease had already advanced too much and that it would probably only help to alleviate his suffering. It was a really bad day. Whenever I, or someone of the gang could, we were at his house and every weekend of the vacation, after treatment, we played RPG and, in the meantime, he made all, ABSOLUTELY ALL the possible and imaginable jokes about death, cancer, whatever you imagine. He accepted it in a way that none of us accepted at the time and that it is still difficult to accept now. After a few months, the time we could play was decreasing, he needed to rest more and more, until in August 2016 he died while sleeping. Even today I remember not crying. It didn't seem real. It still doesn't seem like it, honestly, as if he would give me a call on the weekend and asking about Tormenta, D&D or Call of Cthulhu. The last thing he said to me was to put more bizarre monsters on the next adventure because his dice were itchy to use Smite Evil. I still laugh about it sometimes. Sometimes I still think about what kind of aberrant creature and demon I could toss on a guy who was going through hell every day. He wasn't even 17 when he died. Life went on, everyone learned to accept it, but I spent a long time without really dedicating myself to running a campaign, it didn't seem right. As if I owed my friend an adventure that I would never pay for. Today, for the first time in years, I went through my old RPG magazines and photocopies and found one thing: an old, battered character sheet, from a Level 18 Goblin Paladin called G'Rainklir. Maybe it was just a coincidence, maybe it's time to pay for that last adventure I owe. For now, I'm just smiling at the good times and crying for the same reason. I miss you buddy, I hope you are well

I find it weirdly moving that people that have not played D&D in years (and maybe decades) are feeling outrage at how the current custodian of TTRPG’s biggest brand are bungling and exploiting their partners. Maybe the take away from all of this is that D&D is not simply a product owned by a particular seattle company, but a culture and an essence that clearly can find interpretation and life in other games.

1c6ssoc,"My son saved my life with 40K and D&D, trying to figure out how to thank him","I honestly didn't know where to post this, but I needed to get it off my chest.

A few years ago during covid, my marriage and my life fell apart. It had always been rocky, but one day out of the blue I come home to find that my house had been completely trashed, my kids had moved out with their mom, and I was left alone. To make matters worse, I had lost my job and had a hard time finding another one due to the epidemic. I was actually, at 43 years old, making sandwiches at Publix. So here I am, no money, no kids, in a trashed house with even my pets gone. And I have some chronic health problems that due to not having insurance, were going untreated. I was falling apart mentally and physically.

I honestly considered suicide, but I could never do it because of my kids.

My son was into 40K and he said that he wanted to start playing on the weekend.  I managed to get an eBay credit card and lucked out finding a fully painted space marine force for 300 bucks. Every Saturday we would go to lunch and then to the game store to play. His new stepdad was pretty well off, so he was always playing different armies, but I played my space marines.

I was so poor that sometimes the rest of the week me and my new cat would share eggs for dinner. He never said anything, but he started paying for his own lunch. Then he would buy kits here and there for my favorite army, Orks. He would build them. He said it was so he could have someone to paint with.

Eventually I found a decent job and got mentally well enough to start putting my home together again (I won the home in the divorce, which is another story. I deserved it). I started my old D&D game back up. People would come and go, but he was there every other week. Never missed a game unless he was out of town.

Cut to now, I have a very good paying job, a wonderful girl that I plan to marry, and am happy, if a bit scarred. He still comes over to play and paint, and he makes sure I go to the gym with him four days a week as well.

We don't talk about feelings. We don't hug. I don't know how much of this was a plan to help me or just spend time with me, and how much of it was him wanting to play games. If I tried to thank him, I know he would freeze up and wouldn't be able to talk.

I want to thank him for saving my life but I don't know how. I have literally opened my mouth to say something a dozen times and couldn't get the words out.

  
(edit) I should add that my girlfriend is a huge part of this as well. Most of the rebuilding was due to her help. I just left her out because I don't have issues thanking her and telling her how I feel, but she is as awesome as he is.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x283ba8fb0>,rpg,1713408703.0

af9cze,Have you ever walked out from a table without even starting the game?,"I just did for the first time. Due to age and drifting apart, my usual table can't barely get together, so I went to a local shop to ask if anyone would be interested in a game. I've been GM about 95% of my time in the hobby, and I told them I would be happy to direct a group.

So a group says they want to try pathfinder. We are making sheets, some have played d&d 3.5 way back, so they have a handle on things. I start discussing pathfinder 2e. My main complaint was skills. One goes:

""So what do you want skills for?""

I explain that skills are important for role-playing, finding solutions outside combat, etc.

One looks me dead in the eye and goes "" why do you want to avoid combat? This is d&d...""

And then they went on to describe combats they have had. By the way they were talking, they were very used to meta-gaming, power gaming and all in all generally be ""that guy"", not talking situations in game seriously.

So, what did I do? I let them finish the characters. I decide to give them a chance. Start already travelling. They meet a family travelling by caravan (the hook). The CLERIC, immediately, attacks the family. The others join. They kill half of it, except a kid and the mother.

""Ok, the boy is crying and the woman is holding his only surviving child, she is looking at you furiously, but knowing that they are both helpless. What do you do?""

The elf goes, ""do I know of any slavers?""

Half-orc barbarian (because of course he fucking was). ""Maybe de could keep the woman...""

So I straight up close the handbook, stand up and leave. The only thing I said was: ""look, I'm not willing to waste my time here"".

516de8,I once spent two and a half months setting up a pun.,"I originally posted this to r/dmdadjokes, but I figured some of you might appreciate it.

This was part of my longest D&D campaign. It was pretty homebrewed 3.5, and we had the perfect mix of personalities. They also seemed to really appreciate all the work I put into writing for them.

The one thing they all *hated*, was the fact that it's nearly impossible for me to write without hiding puns in the content. It's compulsive. Even in my English classes, I would pepper in sentences that contained the most absurd puns.

It's a problem I've no intention of correcting.

So, in this game, the players have gotten to level 8 or 9, and they were exploring a new city. There were tons of things for the characters to do, NPCs to talk with, and thousands of little threads for them to pull on, but the one they went after most was this mysterious, humongous library.

Unbeknownst to the players, my DM notebook contained the helpful reminder ""something something mad god's library"" and the stupid punchline. That's it.

So, flying by the seat of my pants, I came up with this **crazy** layout. Eventually I sat down and wrote out a huge backstory for it, but it was still with the one gag in mind.

All the shelves were made of faded books, and all the readable books were in the wrong places. Any time they wanted to find something, it was inevitably in a different section: a famous NPC's history in the home and garden section, research on dragons in the fantasy section, poisonous alchemy in the cooking section, ect. This confused the shit out of them, and almost every second of down time they got was devoted to exploring this weird library.

There was a tall, creepy librarian (often the only other person in there) with a graying hair-bun and a hooked nose. She wore a black gown, and seemed to glide everywhere she went. She hardly spoke to them, but would point as a means to answer questions, and shush them if they got too loud. 

Eventually the players found a back room hidden behind a bookshelf. It had a ""Members Only"" sign on it, and when they asked the librarian about it, she quietly handed them a long form to fill out. (There was no trick here, but my players know better than to trust something that seems easy.)

Rather than get a library card, they resort to stealing books and replacing them after use. They soon noticed that if they left a book out of place, it would inevitably wind up in its randomly specific location. This weirded the rogue out most of all, and he convinced the fighter and the cleric that their best option was to break into the members only area in the middle of the day. Naturally, the rest of the party followed along. 

When they got to the other side they found this impossibly gigantic labyrinth of bookshelves. As they walked around, they noticed that the shelves were moving and changing on their own and they had no idea where to go. Well, two of them could fly (cleric and the fighter) and one was a teleporter (rogue,) so they scouted above while the others (witch and samurai) walked below

The rogue immediately noticed that the librarian was coming after them; shelves moved to make a path, and she seemed to glide straight to the people on the ground.

Well, never one to let a good idea come between him and an irrational impulse, the cleric took off in a dive straight for her, and  brandished his warhammer with a natural 20 toward intimidation. The terrified librarian shrieked and collapsed onto the ground, pulling books down on top of her and spasming in shock. 

Ever the honorable helper, the samurai leapt into action; pulling a syringe from his jacket. (Ok, so about that syringe... It fully heals and negates all status effects... But it also sends you into an uncontrollable rage) 
The samurai plunges the ""health potion"" straight into her heart, and fully injects the serum. 

The table went silent, apart from my laughter, and the fighter said ""I can not believe you just did that.""

Before they could really reflect on the choices made, the librarian let out a howling screech that knocked books off the shelves, and shook the floor. As the samurai backed up, he saw the librarian's torso crack and push outward. Still screaming, her face began to elongate, and her hands stretched into massive claws. Her back arched, and as the skin was stretched to its limit, wings shredded through where her shoulder blades had been.

At this point everyone was spending so much time arguing in character about what to do, no one did anything. The woman's face was shredded as a mouth in the shape of a humpback whale pushed out; it's baleen resembled the fanned pages of a paperback. As the monster grew, it started standing up on all fours. Huge cracks ran the length of the floor where it stepped. The librarian's skin was shredded like a bad sunburn to make room for leathery scales. Along its joints, and down its spine were golden bookbindings. It's huge wings fanned out to reveal feathered pages of arcane script, scrawled haphazardly.

The witch was the first to act. She ran up to the now 15 foot monster, and was backhanded into the bookshelf the rogue was standing on. In a single round, the monster had grown to over 30 feet tall, its weight started putting a huge strain on the ground. In the next round, the floor gave way and everyone who was not flying began to tumble into darkness.

Thinking quickly, the rogue reached out with his ability and saw that the floor was almost eight hundred feet down. He began teleporting the non-flyers to safety while the cleric and the fighter used their illuminated weapons to battle the slow-falling giant; it's enormous, leather bound claws, raking and clasping for them.

Dodging debris, and fighting a leathery whale-dragon, they eventually got within range of the witch, who proceeded to send torrents of flame up at the monster (and them.) The cleric used his warhammer to cripple its wings, and send it plummeting. When it landed, it roared up just as the fighter came down, rolling a perfect 20 and sailing bastard-sword-first into the creature's mouth, and out of its throat.

Pages began to burn away as the monster crumpled in a heap. Bleeding and weary, our adventurers found themselves in a massive underground cathedral. Deep, slow laughter came from the darkness all around them.

""So,"" said the god of madness, ""I see you've defeated my bookwyrm.""

Silence.

The rogue started laughing and shaking his head. The witch looked incredulous. The cleric put his head on the table. The samurai just smiled and tried to tell if I was serious. The fighter pushed his chair back and said ""I'm going to smoke. You are the fucking worst.""

As soon as they heard it, they knew that the past two months of their gaming lives had been an elaborate set up to the dumbest shit I could think of. I honestly would be hard pressed to find a moment where I made myself laugh harder. Just, the sheer amount of time and planning it took for that payoff was so worth it. I had tears streaming down my face as they left my house. The beautiful stupidity of it makes me smile to this day.

We took a week off and picked up from where we stopped. The game went on for another year and a half.

1iiloeu,"I love you all, but when a 5E-Only player says they wanna try to branch out...","...for the love of Cthulhu, *stop recommending PbtA games*. I'm begging you.

I am glad you like PbtA. I am. I love this community and I think it's great that PbtA has such enthusiastic fans. But I swear to Crom, it is a TERRIBLE idea to recommend a PbtA (or PbtA adjacent) game to someone just barely peeking their head out of the Cave of 5th Edition.

It's like if someone in Cleveland said, ""hey, I'm tired of the place I usually eat, do you know any other good restaurants?"" and you recommended something in PARIS. Yes, I'm sure it's very good, BUT IT'S TOO FAR FROM WHERE THEY ARE NOW TO BE A USEFUL SUGGESTION.

RuneQuest. Shadow of the Demon Lord/Weird Wizard. DCC. Pathfinder. There are plenty of games that are still crunchy high fantasy with fun combat systems that AREN'T 5th edition, things that will broaden a 5E player's horizons without making them bluescreen. I know a bunch of you are Apocalypse-pilled, but one of the things PbtA fans seem to love about it is that it is SO VERY DIFFERENT from ""traditional"" rpgs (which 5E clearly is). Maybe - JUST MAYBE - giving someone who only knows 5E a game that requires them to COMPLETELY REBUILD THEIR CONCEPTION OF HOW RPGs WORK is... I dunno, *a little much*.

With all the love in the world, I ask you to be gentle with them. They're trying. Steppin' out of their comfort zone. Please don't throw 'em into the deep end right off.

EDITED TO ADD:

For everyone who said that what's *really* important is to find out *why* someone wants to try stuff outside 5e and *what* they are looking for before deciding whether to suggest a PbtA game, I have two responses to make:

1. This is an *excellent* point, the kind of thing that really moves the conversation forward constructively, and I agree 101%.
2. In my entire time in this subreddit, I have never once seen a PbtA fan actually ask what someone is looking for in a game-rec before jumping in to suggest a PbtA game.

~~it seems, that my site offends some artists and I don´t want to ripp them off.~~

~~I think in many cases regarding AI the world is not ready yet.~~

&#x200B;

~~My further plan is searching for artists, who want to cooperate in a project like this with me. To make a solid avatar generator without offending artists I need tons of drawings and illustrations of fantasy faces and your commitment to use them for training. If you are an artist reading this, feel free to contact me.~~

~~I personally didn´t want to make a huge amount of money (as you noticed there was no coffee button, no ads, nothing) I just wanted to give the PnP community nice avatars. Perhaps we can find a business model where you can generate profit or fame and I can build a fair avatar generator with YOUR pictures.~~

~~I hope you guys all understand my trouble and I hope to come back with a cleaner solution without these complications.~~

ghx7w9,"I was bullied at GenCon as a 13 yr old in 1978. Reminder to take care, especially of the young ones in the gaming world.","I thought I would share a story of when I was a kid, with hope other gamers can be reminded how important it is to take care of each other, and especially take care of the young kids at game stores and online and at conventions.

It was 1978 or so, and I was 12 or 13 years old. I was a complete D&D fanatic (5th level half-orc fighter) and played a ton of other rpg's as well like Traveller, Boot Hill, Top Secret, Chivalry and Sorcery, Tunnels and Trolls... and we also played a lot of Avalon Hill and SPI games, Steve Jackson games, Lou Zocchi, Judges Guild scenarios like Tegel Manor... I subscribed to The Dragon and Strategy & Tactics magazine. I was from a middle class family in Sarasota Florida, my dad was a writer, and when I found out about GenCon in Wisconsin I was so excited that such a place existed. I asked my parents if I could go - alone. And they said yes.

My parents were permissive and I had a lot of freedom as a kid, maybe too much, but they did realize this was a big, big deal for a 13 year old -- to fly across the country and stay in a hotel room for a role playing and wargame convention. But it was my idea, and they had encouraged me to stretch beyond my age a lot in my life - which was a good thing and has served me well. So they decided to support my love for games and the incredible opportunity to be at GenCon. Wow! Thanks Mom & Dad!

I took a plane, got the bus to my hotel room, and was at GenCon!!!

It was like an amazing all you can eat buffet of games. The games sessions list was enormous. There were miniatures and wargame dioramas everywhere, and dealer room was huge. I was scared around all these new people alone, but also excited. I had arrived at heaven! I remember the developers of a game called Ace of Aces - a picture book game - saw me walking around, and so they stopped me and played a round standing in front of their table, and I bought a copy of the 2 book set, still have it. And there were a ton of games to sign up for - so I signed up to play the Top Secret RPG - I loved 007 and secret agents and to play Top Secret was super exciting to me.

But the problem was I was really really shy. Scared. Talking with strangers was scary. Being there was scary. It was very hard for me to imagine playing a game with all these new people. Very hard. I wanted to stay in the dealer room and look at all the games and just read the rulebooks I had bought. It seemed like nobody was my age - this was a wargame convention, D&D was popular but there were no other kids my age I could see. I stood out, felt massively self conscious, like the small middle school kid at the cafeteria surrounded by larger seniors. (I don't know how conventions are now but I think back then it was a lot of college age and older?) I was really scared to not fit in with these other older people! But at the same time these were gamers and we all loved games right? So I gathered some courage and pushed myself and signed up, figuring if I got started and broke the ice and went to one game it would be easier to sign up for more.

I got to the room for the Top Secret session and there were about 11 players. All a lot older than me. The gamemaster (""administrator"" in Top Secret lingo) handed out pre-generated characters, and we started our mission to infiltrate a secret government facility. I was doing pretty well -- I was good at these games! -- and I found myself up on the roof, with the chance of a way into the facility that others hadn't spotted. I was playing an RPG I loved at GenCon!

At one point I had to get down from the roof to continue the mission. So I jumped down.

Now the gamemaster looked at me and said I had to take 1d6 of damage. Wait what? I said ""I need to take damage from jumping down?"" and he said Yes, annoyed that I had challenged him. I was flushed with humiliation and went silent. I rolled, I got a 4 or something. I had very low hit points to start. I was dead.

A wave of shame went over me, I had killed off my own character.

It was really disappointing and I felt bad. I looked around the room it was clear they didn't want me there, the only little kid among the adults. I gathered my things and left the room.

As I closed the door behind me I heard the room burst into laughter. I had felt bad when my character died, but now I plunged into searing emotional pain. I was extremely humiliated and in shock, feeling and hearing the entire room of players, who I wanted to like me and who I wanted to play games with, make fun of me behind my back. I started crying and went and hid somewhere away from everyone.

It took me a long time to figure it out, but I realized two things had happened.

First, I was the youngest person in the room, and so as a trick I had been given a pre-gen character that I realized was the weakest character in the scenario, with a weak strength and low hit points. Then I also realized that I had been tricked into dying -- I had said I ***jumped*** off the roof but the GM had made me roll damage as if I had ***fallen***\*,\* in order to try to kill me. The GM had set me up as a weak character unfairly, and then even more unfairly broken the rules of the game to kill me off by calling my jump a fall. When I questioned him on the rules I was right and he was wrong -- as anyone could plainly see. But nobody backed me up or spoke up for me and he went ahead and made me roll damage. And then the GM and the entire room had laughed at me when I died, as if who was I, a little kid, to be at their convention, the stupid little kid who killed himself off.

I didn't sign up for any other games running in the convention.

No one in that room knew how vulnerable I was to this bullying. Maybe if they had known more about me, it wouldn't have happened. But that's always how bullying is - the victim can be vulnerable and get hurt in ways the bullies don't bother to think about or care about. But seeing this kid at the convention surrounded by adults they should have realized I was vulnerable and somebody, anybody, should have made an effort to stand up for me, to speak up for me, to protect me. Nobody did.

Going off on my own across country, on a flight alone and in a hotel room alone and getting around alone - it was totally awesome. Gary freaking Gygax was there! There was a giant room of games! These were my people, maybe I could make friends here! It could have been a triumph. It could have shown me that I was strong and could trust myself and could be out in the world, I didn't have to just be shy and afraid. It could have helped me trust my interests in life. Me, a shy kid who didn't fit in - I should have been able to fit in here. And there was some evidence of that - they guys who created Ace of Aces were really nice to me and treated me as an equal, sure they wanted to sell their game, but it was a really cool game and I enjoyed playing. But now with getting killed off and then laughed at by everyone behind my back, the whole room of people I wanted to like me and wanted to let me fit in with -- the shame and humiliation overcame the positive.

For the rest of my life - I'm now 54 - this experience has stayed with me. Being an outsider, not fitting in, taking risks then just getting humiliated - I see this has happened as a pattern. So GenCon Top Secret definitely wasn't the only experience of bullying I had, and it definitely wasn't the only event that was traumatic when I went out on my own in the world, Sure my parents could have done a much better job protecting me maybe.

But getting bullied like that in a role playing game I desperately wanted to play - I loved secret agents - in a community that should have been my home - role playing games - it ended up being more proof in my heart. Proof that I had to just stay shy and hold back and not trust and be on the outside because life just bullies you when you try. It was one brick in the wall of a trauma for me (also a big Pink Floyd fan). I carry this memory with me every day as one scar among many, along with all the other bricks in my wall.

I've done a lot of personal emotional work to heal my childhood wounds. I'm a gamer these days. I put myself out there and I'm no longer shy. But as anyone who lives with trauma and bullying knows, you never can heal completely, these experiences as children shape us deeply. And they build up. Especially on life events that are exceptional - like the first trip away from home as a kid - even a single trauma can have huge effects.

It's not that I want to blame this one incident for troubles in my life. My life has been great and I have a lot of freedom from the trauma patterns and limitations that I carried a lot when I was younger. I have healed. But I also wonder: what would it have been like if just one person from that group had noticed me and tried to help me? What if one person from that group had left the room and caught up with me, and said ""Hey, you know, that was wrong you had to roll damage from a jump, the rules are that falls, not jumps, cause damage. You know, that gamemaster is a jerk, why don't you join our game later, our GM is awesome and we have a younger player with us who you might like."" What if just one person had seen me, had seen what happened, had stood up for me and helped me? What if I was given some validation and encouragement, and instead of not signing up for any other games, what if I had found the strength to play, and what if I then had some good experiences playing and even made some friends and GenCon? Could it have made a difference if someone had helped me? And who knows, could it maybe even have made a huge difference for the course of the rest of my life?

So when you see a young player at a convention, in your online group, at the game store game night - please. Take some responsibility as an adult. Kids need us, they need us to help keep them protected and safe. Not just from the obvious dangers for young teens out in the world, but from the seeming smaller incidents of ridicule, or teasing, or being laughed at, or being bullied, or being tricked. Like me they might be shy and silent, they might not speak up, but maybe they need protection from feeling hurt and vulnerable and sensitive inside. You might think it's not a big deal, but that kid might really, really, be vulnerable. Without protection they might grow up and struggle for decades to heal.

The kindness and caring you show might make a difference, even a huge difference, maybe even change the course of their life.

ps

Must have been 1980? That's when Top Secret was released?

Update-
After posting this I didn't visit the thread again until now. I just re-read my post and am crying. The fact that so many people upvoted and I got my first Reddit gold and all the comments - well it says something very important to me that if I risk telling my truth the world can welcome me. I want everyone to know that me not being here to answer comments hasn't been for lack of interest just how vulnerable and raw and real this is for me. All of you who took a risk and told a story and all of you who have been supportive in comments - well at 54 I am still a sensitive guy at 54 with all kinds of life struggles and you have given me a story to tell for the rest of my life that will always open my heart and being tears to my eyes. ""Hey did I tell you I was bullied as a teen at an rpg convention then posted about it on Reddit and got a thousand upvotes."" BIG SMILE. Maybe even some healing. You all gave my story a new ending and I'm really grateful. 

The new ending is the gamer community did stand up for me, after all.

lmmasq,"REMINDER: Just because this sub dislikes D&D doesn't mean you should avoid it. In fact, it's a good RPG to get started with!","People here like bashing D&D because its popularity is out of proportion with the system's quality, and is perceived as ""taking away"" players from their own pet system, but it is not a bad game. The ""crunch"" that often gets referred to is by no means overwhelming or unmanageable, and in fact I kind of prefer it to many ""rules-light"" systems that shift their crunch to things that, IMO, shouldn't have it (codifying RP through dice mechanics? Eh, not a fan.)

Honestly, D&D is a great spot for new RPG players to start and then decide where to go from. It's about middle of the road in terms of crunch/fluff while remaining easy to run and play, and after playing it you can decide ""okay that was neat, but I wish there were less rules getting in the way"", and you can transition into Dungeon World, or maybe you think that fiddling with the mechanics to do fun and interesting things is more your speed, and you can look more at Pathfinder. Or you can say ""actually this is great, I like this"", and just keep playing D&D.

Beyond this, D&D is a massively popular system, which is a **strength**, not a reason to avoid it. There is an abundance of tools and resources online to make running and playing the system easier, a wealth of free adventures and modules and high quality homebrew content, and many games and players to actually play the game with, which might not be the case for an Ars Magica or Genesys. For a new player without an established group, this might be the single most important argument in D&D5E's favor. 

So don't feel like you have to avoid D&D because of the salt against it on this sub. D&D 5E is a good system. Is it the best system? I would argue there's no single ""best"" system except the one that is best for you and your friends, and D&D is a great place to get started finding that system.

128zaai,One of my players said some very uncomfortable things and I don't know what to do,"[Marked NSFW for mention of rape]

I GM a Pathfinder 2e table every Saturday (if there's no scheduling problems). Today, before starting the session, I was talking to the players (there are four of them plus me as the GM) how I wanted to change the day of the sessions because of our players wasn't able to come because of her boss.

One player, which I'll call V, starting talking about how tables where the GM gives too much freedom to players never go well, using one the players (I'll call him K) as an example, because K was new to the system as wanted to make some kinda wild characters.

V and K already had disagreements before, with V complaining that K wasn't ""helping the party"", alongside another player, which even interrupted a session before it began once. However, after that, V starting using other examples outside RPG... specifically, ""forced"" representation of queer characters, which, *in his own words*, ""hurt the ego of straight viewers"".

When I asked him to elaborate, he gave a half-assed explanation about including women and minorities where they ""don't belong"", such as in the show Vikings and in the live-action Little Mermaid. He also said (I think, my hearing kinda fails me sometimes) that the Little Mermaid actress ""didn't act black"".

He also said the Disney was putting this actress under fire, because making a white character black will obviously cause blacklash directed to her. And he also talked about corporations just using minorities to make money. These two points I agree... but then he followed up the second point by saying ""woke culture"" was ruining TTRPGs because Pathfinder's official adventures didn't include rape or slavery.

I tried to calmly explain to him that, while the adventures have lots of graphic violence, those two topics are usually more sensible, and the GM can always include or exclude any topic if the players feel or don't feel comfortable. But he just kept saying Paizo was a hypocrite.

Needless to say, we were *very* uncomfortable with what he said. I proceeded with the session, until V had to leave and we didn't have enough players to continue.
Honestly, I don't even know what to do at this point. He already lashed out against the players before because they weren't ""playing their roles right"". While I agree they made major mistakes before, V still lashed out very angrily (even DMing me saying he was carrying the party), even though this is just a game, and today was even worse.

Should I talk to him about this? He will probably not change his opinion, but I don't know if banning him outright is the best option. What do you guys think?

a3nkxw,"Our group just has to kick ""that guy"" out of the group, and it sucked because he is/was a friend. [Rant/Bemoan & Group Conflict stories here, I suppose]","First of all, sorry if my writing is janky, I'm on my phone and I suck at phone typing. 

So I've been playing with roughly the same tabletop rpg group for five years (D&D mostly, but other systems too) and this week 5 of our 6 members finally broke the news to Mr. 6.

Overall, I've been blessed with a very stable and rich group experience for most of my tabletop career, but I've gotta say, this is easily the worst experience I've had in the last 11 years with RPGs. I came here to vent and warn you all... communication is key, but some differences are irreconcilable.

4 of our 6 players, including me and my fiance, work together. Mr. 6 is also in that group of 4. The other 2 are old friends from college who moved back to town after graduating. They're return acted as the catalyst that led to this week's events. Before that it was just the four of us, scrapping up fun on short, ramshackle campaigns. Some were good, others fell apart. 

Our standards were low, and while gaming was overall a positive experience, this group's campaigns were never anything too memorable. The problems with Mr 6. started back then, but with only 4 players, we simply endured.

Now that the foundation is set, let me elaborate about our issues with Mr. 6.

1. He absolutely cannot roleplay. At best he identifies a single character trait that his character has, and only pursues that one angle. In other words: he plays a gimmick. Also, because he can't roleplay, all of his character knowledge is player knowledge, unless we police him.

2. He's a min-maxer. Almost every single character option he chooses has a numerical benefit that aids in his gimmick mentioned above. He also cannot recognize the fact he min-maxs everything. A recent character of his was defended with his logic that ""My character is balanced because he has a really low stat to even out his really high stat!"" Completely unaware that is pretty close to the definition of min-maxing.

3. He gets upset anytime his character underperforms in battle or anytime his plot or puzzle assumptions aren't correct. So if he misses more than twice in a row, he checks out. If he assumes a certain NPC is up to something and he's proven wrong, he checks out. If he doesn't ""get"" a puzzle? Checks out. Basically, if he doesn't do awesome, he gets grumbly and jumps on his phone .

4. He cheats. (In fairness, He's gotten better through the years). He used to reroll his dice if he rolled poorly and he thought the dm was distracted and didn't see him roll. Hes been confronted about this though, and now tends to rely on rolling behind debris on the table and scooping up his dice before we can confirm his roll, or ""forgetting what he rolled"" after scooping his dice back up. He's also been fond of inflating modifiers, but I tend to shadow calculate his rolls and call him on it when it happens, so he's backed away from that method.

5. He cannot stay focused. In game he will regularly start interrupting combats or roleplaying with anecdotes relating to recent news or pop culture events. This mostly happens when a different player/character has roleplaying challenge where he is not directly involved, or during a combat where he is doing poorly.

Ok. *sigh*

While issues 1 and 2 are probably the most frustrating with our group, I want to make it clear that those are valid forms of gameplay. Some people can't roleplay well, and some campaigns or systems really expect you to number-crunch for every advantage. We get that. It's just unfortunate that our group has really grown into roleplaying and storytelling, and he just doesn't mesh with our group anymore. Its almost not his fault, he's in his 60s, he grew up with OD&D and AD&D 1st edition. He's Gygaxian. 

While issues 1 and 2 drag the fun down, he's still a coworker and friend, so we could tolerate it... in theory. The bottom line when it came down to deciding he's out are issues 3 and 5. It's not just his in-game performance, it's his around-the-table attitude. (Honeatly issue 4, the cheating, only happens once every few sessions, so that's our lowest concern). 

It's just that 2 years ago my college friends came back and they introduced some honest-to-goodness standards into our group, and our entire groups roleplaying has really taken off! Except Mr. 6. It's gotten to the point where we all are having fun, until he interrupts the bard's intense infiltration/bluff mission with an anecdote about ""how political correctness is ect. ect. ect."". Or he's just start trying to share funny cat videos during combat, those sort of thing. He's dragging the mood down.

Well, this last shift change (our shifts change every 6 months), he couldn't make it work and bowed out. And our group realized something around 10 sessions in... we are having way more fun now.

So it was decided that we would break the news to him this week. Unfortunately, communication was... poor. And essentially he was told 3 separate things by 3 separate players, all at different times. One told him that he just wouldn't fit in the current campaign, and maybe something would work 6 months from now. Another player went with brutal honesty and told him he just can't roleplay and doesn't work with the group anymore. I had told him something in between those two answers. 

It was a mess. None of us wanted him to get hurt, because at the end of the day he is still a coworker and a friend. In our defense we didn't pull this from nowhere. He's been talked to numerous times over the years, the cheating, the interrupting, the lack of roleplaying... none of it has changed with him.

It just felt so good playing without him. Without the constant immersion breaks. But now I feel like crap. And I can't sleep.

How did/do you deal with problem players? I would very much like to hear your experiences or opinions on these sort of events?

Lastly, I was going to post this on r/dnd, but its not really about that game in particular... am I correct in assuming this belongs here? Sorry, new to this sub...

This might sort under self-promotion, but since it's all free, I hope it's ok.   
I've also realized how valuable people find it.  
I have posted similar posts to similar forums before and received amazing feedback. 

See, I'm a music composer, and have almost 400 tracks. It's currently being used on live events, games, podcasts and just as background music in living room DnD campaigns. 

I mostly compose fantasy, celtic, cinematic, medieval and viking music and I'm one of the very few who lists music in this genre as royalty free, making it extremely easy to get your hands on by anyone across the great steppes of the web. 

It can all be downloaded directly from [**my website**](https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com/royalty-free-music/), and for commercial purposes it requires proper attribution, but for non-commercial and personal purposes it requires absolutely nothing. 

Hopefully, you'll find this useful. I don't really know if there's lack of soundtracks in this community, but based on all the appreciative email I get, it feels like there is. 

If you're using it for online videos, streaming or podcasting, feel free to reach out to me with a link!

bz1ule,"I've been playing an RPG with my 5 year old for months, and it's been so incredibly precious","So, I have a very imaginative five year old. I've tried games like No Thank You Evil and Untold with her, but it just wouldn't hold her attention. I basically gave up.

Then one day I just made one up, in a cafe. We were sat there, and I started telling a story. I asked if she wanted to make a character for the story. Then, I asked how her character would react. She fought a giant frog, and was hooked. The only rules were that she had five health, and she had to roll a 4-6 if she wanted to do something she might fail at.

It's now a few months later. We've added some more rules.  She loves her character and I've learned a lot about my little girl. She's kind, diplomatic, funny, brave and very imaginative. We've created a world together that we both care about. She's rescued friends, caught thieves and psychoanalysed a demon. She has her own little book, where she writes down what's been happening.

It's wonderful, and something I will always remember. I made a map of [the world we've made, here :)](http://imgur.com/sGgsY0I)

TL;DR - I tried 'kids' RPG games with my 5 year old. They didn't take, so I just made one up with almost no rules and she loves it. I learned a lot about my daughter and it's been a precious time.

EDIT: This was made with Inkarnate, which is amazing. So I can't take too much credit for how awesome the map looks - it only took about four hours total

sqsugg,All my players are dead and I didn't tell them.,"I did a very bad job as gm. Three months ago, my players were scouting a caravan and suddenly they fell in a goblin ambush. I didn't manage the fight correctly and it was basically a tpk.I think the greatest problem was that the fight began at the ending of one session and continued at the beginning of another, so I didn't know what to do after the tpk.

In a panic, I just rolled with it, they woke up as if dreaming and the caravan went on.The town was weird. My wizard noted that everyone that they met had a familiar face, but they failed all the insights tests that I gave them, so they thought that was just a strange coincidence.

In the next session, I went a little overboard. I dug into their backstories and noted everything that could be useful and uncommon, old allies, dead family, etc.

The city mayor offered them a household as a reward for their protection, so they had a reason to stick around. The bard had a sad backstory about how his father disappeared years ago. Imagine his surprise when a letter in his father's handwriting was waiting for them in the new house. Following the letter's instructions, they found a strange cave where surreal things were going on; floating skulls, visions of their past adventures, old allies on the walls crying.

The bard had an encounter with his father, who appeared as a white angel projection thing. They had a cute moment and all the time the father was saying metaphors of ""you need to go on"", ""rest your soul"", ""go on with your existence"" kind of thing. In that session, I stopped using the word life.

Going back to town, they found a place exactly like the field where they fought the goblins. I made sure to use the same words to describe the battleground. There they found the bodies of dead adventurers the same class as them. This was kind of dead in the nose, but they are stupid.The bodies woke up and fought them. All the fight they were saying secrets that only the players would know and calling them sinners that would soon be forgotten.

A lot happened after that. They started seeing strange creatures that resemble angels of the bible, a lot of animals that I made sure to describe as ancient or extinct, strange people that seemed out of place, they never saw goblins again, etc.

It has come to a point that I do not know anymore how to tell them that they are dead in a subtle way, they played this characters for over a year, I feel sad to let them go.

UPDATE:  I'm really thankful for every comment on this post. I've decided to keep them going in this post-death state to explore the weird themes that are hard to display in normal fantasy, thinking of Spec Ops The Line or Planetscape Torment to draw inspiration from. 

There are just some things that are still left in the open. What if they die again?

I have a lot of anxiety problems when things go off the rails, and when they do I panic and improvise too much, the kind of improvisation that, simply saying, destroy plots. 

Until now, they haven't tried to leave the village. I will probably make them go out in the next session and start giving more clear hints that there is nowhere left to go. 

After that, well, maybe I will do another post when this story ends, I'm trying to not plan too much ahead, and see where the dice takes us. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x286f5f2f0>,rpg,1644676485.0

xm956t,School D&D Club is out of control!!! D&D is not a niche hobby anymore.,"I am a middle school shop teacher and it was brought to my attention by the administration that there was some interest from students to form a school D&D club. They knew I liked D&D because I had run a small activity with a group of about 12 students last year. So I said sure, I would be the staff coordinator for that. I thought we would get about 20 students at most so we could have 4 groups running in an after school program. 

Boy was I wrong! We have almost 50 students sign up so far and are the biggest club in the school! This is awesome but I was wondering if there were any other teachers out there who have experience running a school D&D club and if they have any advice they could give me?

&#x200B;

So far I have done a survey of students to find out who has experience and who is interested in DMing. I have also setup a Google Classroom with resources that will be beneficial for new and experienced players.

EDIT: wow the response to this has been huge! I am getting lots of great advice and hearing stories about other people's experiences. And folks saying this is inspiring them to start a club at their schools is one of the best things I have heard.

Folks have been DMing me offering me access to resources they have, one-shots, premade characters, etc. Others have even made cash donations to help with the purchase of books and dice.

1cpupus,"Hey, it's me, the guy at your table who only wants to play D&D. After three years of trying other systems, now I get what my problem is.","So I'll be the first to admit I'm exactly the kind of player who makes it hard for you, the person reading this, to play other games. I'm sorry! I've been playing one campaign or another since mid-2014, which is exactly long enough to experience a decade in the hobby without ever needing to play something other than 5E.

But I've been lucky! Of the two main groups I'm in one has never broken away from 5e, but another started branching out into other systems three years back because of the DM's burnout. I'm glad we did, despite all my stubborness along the way. Of the last three years, one was spent entirely on a level 1-10 campaign of Pathfinder 2E, with the other two years jumping between Shadowdark, Mork Borg, Blades in the Dark, Monster of the Week, and finally a Heart: the City Beneath campaign that's ending next week — I haven't  cared much for any of them, though PF2 was probably my favorite of the bunch. I'm probably going to politely bow out of this group before the next campaign in favor of a second 5e table, since I know I'm no more likely to enjoy the next thing they decide to play.

But now I know for sure it's not them. ""Them"" being the other systems, though the other players aren't at fault either. It's me.

There was a time when I would have said I don't have the time to learn other systems. The truth is, I like playing 5E because it asks the least effort out of me. This is fundamentally different from being a hard system to master, because with the exception of PF2E, all the other systems I've tried are less mechanically demanding. Its that D&D 5e is, by far, the system I can put the least amount of effort into while still being an active contributor at the table.

Our GM pitched Mork Borg, and then Shadowdark, by talking a lot about Old School D&D and the movements behind it, with the player-facing problem solving and the lack of solutions ""on the character sheet."" The thing is, I LIKE the solutions being on the character sheet. I don't really mind how lethal those systems are, but I immediately missed being able to solve a problem by rolling the right skill for it. Outside of combat, those OSR games feel more like your DM is running you through an escape room with the amount of time you spend asking questions about the environment and trying to figure out what gets you through dungeons. If I'm playing a character who is a thief, it's because I want the skills for being good at a thief on my table so I can roll to do ""thief things"" when I need to and carry on with the night.

Same with BitD/MotW/Heart, but from a different angle. Those games DO put your skills on the sheet, but the way the conversation plays out at the table is constantly demanding improv on everything else. I was constantly getting frustrated with the DM turning the questions of how I was doing things back on me, and how much those games demand you to narrate things outside of what your character does.

PF2 is close to 5E, but building out the combat the way it does put too much pressure on me most the time to really figure out what was going on in combat and make tactical decisions and use three actions ""wisely."" Most classes in 5E have one, maybe two things they do on their turn, and once you learn them you almost always know what to do when it gets around to you.

And I know that sounds bad. I know! I know this basically all sounds like ""you prefer 5E to these other games because you have to actually try to play them?"" But the answer is actually yeah, exactly! It's not that I'm checked out on my phone or something, but I've learned I'm not actually interested in thinking too much about my part at the table. I think being there at game night with friends is fun, but I mostly just want to be along for the ride until it's time to roll some dice to hit something and let the other players figure out what to do otherwise, maybe get in some banter-in character in between encounters, and chill. In everything else I've played, I'm dead weight if I'm not actively participating. In 5E, I can just kind of vibe until it's time to roll to unlock a door or stab someone, and I'm not penalized for doing that. The game is neither loose enough that it needs my constant imput outside of combat, nor complex enough to need any serious tactical decisions. That's a very comfortable spot for me!

So yeah. I imagine there's a lot of players who would prefer other systems if they tried them, but I'm not one of them. And I imagine there's actually a lot more people like me at tables than you'd expect! Hopefully this gives some insight into why someone would still prefer 5E over everything else, even after giving a lot of other games a shot.

Seriously, wtf? This has always bothered me to no end. Shopify, Wordpress, Discourse, Foundry, even Fantasy Grounds and probably a bunch of companies I'm probably missing all owe their success to making it as easy as possible for 3rd party developers to start building stuff for them. Because even if you're a huge company like Shopify it's damn near impossible to build all the edge cases for your users' needs in-house. It's much easier to build a solid API that they can build themselves or hire someone to build for them.

xr7nfx,The Hollow Knight RPG is really freaking good you guys,"I was looking through the hollow knight subreddit, when I found this gem:

https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/r406lw/introducing_the_unofficial_hollow_knight_ttrpg/

I’ve read through the pdf and played with some characters, and holy fuck this game is good. The racial system of managing different modular traits is really sick, and the martial classes in this game are actually really good. Also it’s about bugs, which is based.

It’s got a really great action economy system with stamina, a resource used to make attacks. Each character has 3 stamina plus 1 for each level in a martial path. You use stamina for attacks, dodging, extra movement, and more. Each attack will cost more stamina for every attack you have already made this turn, so action economy doesn’t spiral out of control. Your stamina regenerates at the start of each turn

The stamina system achieves a couple of things:

1. It makes martials more defensive, since they have more resources to dodge with

2. It give more strategy in combat, since there is a trade off between defensive stamina use and spending stamina on offence

3. I allows casters more nuanced and balanced control options. Instead of binary save of suck options, most spells will instead drain stamina from enemies, like one spell that grapples targets with vines, with it costing 2 stamina to attempt an escape.

Did I mention natural weapons are good and varied in this game, it has a good alchemist class, a good trap based class, and a good poison based class?


This game has all the things I wish that other chunky RPGs like dnd had.

18d80q,"Okay, everyone wanted more detail about the F.A.T.A.L. session, here you go.  [NSFW]. [NSFL]. [NS].  Seriously... do not read. ","Since everybody wants it, I'll post what I recall about the session of F.A.T.A.L. we played.  It's been years so my memory is (thankfully) pretty fuzzy but here goes.

First, everyone showed up EXCEPT Jordon-who's-fault-this-whole-thing-was.  After phoning him up we learned that he'd been called in to work and would be late, but he told us it was okay and to just start without him.  Bastard.  So we started, and right from the get-go it was horrible.  There are primary stats in F.A.T.A.L., each of which is the average of some sub-stats, five I think.  Each sub stat is generated by rolling (4d100/2)-1.  Yep.  I sure hope you love doing averages in your head because you have to about 100 times to make a F.A.T.A.L. character.  Anyway you generate all of these substats by doing the above roll a LOT (even now that equation is seared into my memory, years later) and then you average each set of sub-stats to get each main stat.  Imagine what the room was like trying to get 10 people who'd never played this game to roll that many dice and do that much math in their heads or longhand.  It was chaos.  Yes we could have used calculators but I DID NOT ALLOW IT.  If I had to GM this pig they could do the fucking math the hard way.  Anyway that took about a fucking hour, mostly because I had to keep explaining it to them.  Then Jordan showed up.

He breezed in like it was no problem and had a hearty laugh at our expense, apologized for being so late, and told us to just go ahead and finish up without him.  ""Oh no.  No you sit your fucking ass down and catch up with us you greasy shithumper.  This whole thing is because of YOU!!"" We all said with our eyes (and some of us said it with our mouths too) while we fetched pencils and a blank sheet.  Now that we'd all done it, it went pretty well and after about 15 minutes he was all caught up.  Poor bastard.

Now came the ""skill modifiers"".  You have to look up each stat and find the skill modifier for skills keyed off of that stat.  They're mostly the same but the table is reprinted separately for each ability.  Seriously, there's like 40 pages of nearly identical tables after the stats section for these skill modifiers.  Also each entry on the table has a ""description"" that I think you're supposed to write down,  I don't remember.  I do remember that one of the descriptors for one of the dex-like stats was ""physical movement precision"" and it was all in fractions of an inch.  Retarded.  Some of that stats of course have multiple modifiers like ""maximum speech rate"" which is based off your enunciation stat which is naturally vitally important for casters.  Blerf. One of the characters' had for his language modifier ""undismayed"".  Also there is a rule for ""retard strength"" if a character's intelligence is below 70, so there's that.  (Of course nobody in my group qualified for said retard strength because the stats are so averaged, but it says a lot about the game that it's there, and that it's called ""retard strength.)

About now you're probably thinking ""this isn't so bad, sure the math is overly complex and the bizarre prediliction for averages will result in nearly-identical stats for most characters but it isn't all *horrible* or anything. You're right, at this point it isn't too bad... Leave now.  Seriously.  Stop reading this thread and go to /r/aww for a  while and never  come back.  You'll be better off for the rest of your life if you do, I'm not kidding.

Okay you chose poorly.   So next everybody chose their gender and race.   Under gender there's a whole bit where he basically recapitulates Aristotle's opinions on the differences between the sexes, and gives you modifiers to the stats based on them.  It's pretty sexist but not nearly as bad as you would expect based on the stuff you'll be putting on your character sheet in a few minutes so I gotta give props.  Now you just pick your race and apply the racial modifiers to your stats and you're done with statsOHWAITNOTREALLY!  Now a bunch of your secondary stats have changed haven't they? Guess what that means!  You get to re-average everything to re-derive your primary stats now, isn't that awesome!  Isn't it great that we get to do that all over again?  Interestingly enough there's a paragraph where the author apologizes for using the term ""race"" as that might be deemed inappropriate.  Bear in mind in a little bit you'll be generating the circumference of your asshole to determine how much dong it takes you rape you to death, so being concerned about the term ""race"" is... odd.  Anyway we did all of this without too much difficulty, just some groaning about having to re-derive all 20 (or whatever) stats.  Each race also has a few skill modifiers to jot down and some of them have random traits or special powers.  After the races were all chosen everyone had to record their races various hatreds for the other members of the group based on the race-hate table.  I also suggested that if their character had a particularly high racial hatred for another character's race they could note some of the racial slurs in the helpful list the game includes (One of which is ""stovepiper"" based on the thick dicks one of the races has, I forget which.)

The next chapter was called ""Body"" and is just page after page of tables to determine height, weight, hair color, all that bullshit.  It took us quite a while because it's needlessly detailed and largely nonsensical.  There are tables for everything.  I do remember we had a good laugh at the best feature/worst feature roll.  I think we had a Dwarf with really nice hair but whose worst feature was ""crotch"" so we ruled he was just really really hairy *everywhere*.  Good times.  There's also some  really critical shit in this chapter determined by single die rolls.  for example you roll percentile on the vision quality table at one point and if you roll low you're mostly blind and suck at hitting stuff. One of the players had already decided due to his stats to be mostly ranged but it turned out he couldn't see very well.  Sucked to be that guy.  

Then we hit the stuff F.A.T.A.L. is famous for.

Partway through the body chapter you run into the section about sexual characteristics.  They were just following along and and I said ""okay, now everybody roll for areaola diameter"".  You could have heard a pin drop for about 2 seconds and then laughter and chaos.   Once I got them calmed down they all rolled for that (modified by race of course) then areaola color and hue, then cup size and nipple *length*.  It was hilarious and deeply disturbing at the same time.  The results were hilarious, we were going around the table rolling for each thing and just cracking up laughing at every roll.   We had a troll with enourmous nipples and areaolas like appetizer plates but AA cup breasts.  One guy had a tongue that could touch the top of his nose.  Yes TOP, not tip.  He could almost lick his own eyebrows. Then there's vaginal circumference and depth, which is based on height if I recall correctly with a random percentage added on and then modified by race.  There are even modifiers to VCP based on whether the character is a mother, a nymphmaniac, or a slut.  FYI The modifier to vaginal circumference for being a slut is larger than the one for having given birth, ladies take note.  There's a similar table for ACP (anal circumference, potential) and that was fun for all because everybody has an anus, not everybody has a vagina.  We did some rough comparison and decided that one of the characters could possibly fit another completely inside their anus.  An immediate plan was hatched in case the larger player was ever sent to jail to smuggle the other one inside the larger's anus.  This is the kind of discussion you have while playing this game.  There's even a ""hymen penetration"" or ""hymen resistance"" table, I can't recall the exact name thank god.  There's a bunch of shit about menstruation and fertility rates and such.  Then we (mostly male players) got to the part we'd been waiting for: dicks. EDIT: shit, I forgot to mention this: on vaginal circumference there is a handy ""reference"" column that compares the various vagina size classes to the number of same-species fingers and/or fists that can be inserted therein.  Wow.

Cue to our DM tasking them to rescue a bunch of kids. They met me outside of town and hired my muscles. We went to the lair of the evil witch, kicked her ass, took the kids and out we go. Simple, easy, nice Oneshot. But there is me on the table. While we journeyed back, i took the time to acquaint to each and every child. There was Thomas, who really liked mechanical engines. There was Susan, who was worried about her little brother Asmod because of the injuries he had gotten in the lair. Sohan is missing his stuffy he got from his deceased grandma. And so on. The others thought it to be pretty funny and entertaining... until we got ambushed and Paul fell to an arrow.""PAUL!"", i cried while i held his little body in my arms. Suddenly the fun was gone. Someone died. Someone with a name. Someone with a history.We fought our way out of the forest, two other children wounded, the rest in shock and despair. As the session neared his end i heroicly stayed back ensuring a safe escape for the others.

All of this happened two weeks ago. Since then they had two more sessions and found themself unable to move on from that town. They blame me for fostering an emotional bond between them and the townsfolk. They didn't want to care, but they had to after i had given the children names. After i've given them life.

OP: I want a relatively simple, fast playing, but still tactical RPG, that doesn't use classes, and is good for modern combat. The player characters will be surviving a zombie apocalypse, kind of like the movie Zombieland.

Reply 1: Clearly, what you want is OSR. Have you tried Worlds Without Number? It uses classes, but we'll just ignore that part of your question.

Reply 2: For some reason, I ignored the fact that you asked for an RPG with tactical depth, and I'm going to suggest FATE .

Reply 3. Since you asked for simplicity, I will suggest a system that requires you to make 500 zillion choices at first level for character creation, and requires you to track 50 million trillion separate status effects with overlapping effects: Pathfinder 2E. After all, a role-playing system that has 640 pages of core rules and 42 separate status effects certainly falls under simple, right?

Reply 4: MORK BORG.

Reply 5: You shouldn't be caring about tactical combat, use Powered by the Apocalypse.

Reply 6: You cited Zombieland, a satirical comedy, as your main influence, so I am going to suggest Call of Cthulhu, a role playing game about losing your mind in the face of unspeakable cosmic horrors.

Reply 7: Savage Worlds. You always want Savage Worlds. Everything can be done in Savage Worlds. There is no need for any other system than Savage Worlds.

Reply 8: Maybe you can somehow dig up an ancient copy of a completely out of print RPG called ""All Flesh Must be Eaten.""

Reply 9: GURPS. The answer is GURPS. Everything can be done in GURPS. There is no need for any other system aside from GURPS.

jpktyd,"As a female Game Master for the last thirteen years, I'll only play with fellow women and LGBTQA folks","I started playing dungeons and dragons with my family when I was about 10, my uncle would DM for me, cousins and friends. I always thought the game environment as a safe, creative and fantastic.

But my parents moved to another state, and I decided to hit the local store to find a group. What I found baffled me at the time. Several men, most around the age of my uncle, that treated me (13 year old at the time) in a condescending and *lecherous* manner. I fled that place. But I haven't given up the game, I found out the older brother of a school friend played, and was set up a game with them, it seemed all cool, until all his friends started hitting on my character in game, all the time. I didn't come for another session.

I was 15 and really into the Vampire: the masquerade when I decided to give RPGs another go, this time as a game master. I found a group willing to play at school and we started it. First I took the horror part pretty seriously, but it seems like at 15 all people want to do when playing vampire is to stuck fangs and pick fights.  I took it back to dungeons and dragons, and it worked out for some time. 

When I had to move again, this time for college, it was when things took another uglier turn. I met the gatekeepers of all things geek. I tried to join an rpg community at college, but apparently my vagina was an horrible flaw and at the same time the most wanted thing at the place. 

I spent my first year setting my dog to chase after any of those douches everytime I had the misfortune to cross paths with them.

By the middle of second year I had found other like minded people and we formed a group that would run one shots of several different systems, for we had highly incompatible schedules (different courses and years) and I finally found the people to play with: the underdogs of underdogs, the picked on feminine gay, that weird/ugly girl, the pretty gal that can't play because of the harassment, the autistic guy. 

These days I have a scheduled ""open session"" to people that never played an RPG on the local game shop, with premade sheets to choose from and some already written adventures. Because I know that is it weren't for my first positive contact with the game and live for adventure I would have given up s thousand times over and I wouldn't wish that on new players.

Behind my table is an LGBT flag and a feminist symbol, and at the first sign of bigotry the offending player will be invited to go away. My game table is a safe space, and that will only change when such spaces are no longer needed.

TL;DR: Girl got sick of sexism in games and decides to master, then got sick of harassment and bullying and choose to DM to people that usually won't find good experiences due to the bigotry among players, creating a safe space.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2891593a0>,rpg,1604724769.0

As the title suggests, I GM'ed my first RPG today. ☺️
Until now I was just a player, but WHEW, being GM is a whole other world. 
We played ""kids on brooms"", so I had to come up with the full story. Which led to me writing old diary entries/ love letters in the breaks to plant as hints for my players to discover. 

So here are some things I did NOT expect to go like this. 

1. How much they would derail my story. I know, I KNOW, it always happens but -they. Just. Didn't go to any of the places I had hinted at, and even interrupted my NPC when they were about to get useful information from him 😭
I invented like 10 new NPCs and several new settings  and just... Tried to gently nudge them into the direction the story was supposed to be heading. 
2. How hard it is to just sit by and stay silent while waiting for the players to figure shit out.  I hope I didn't budge in too much to bring their attention to any details in the hints they missed. 
3. I also did not expect all that lowkey sexual tension. Two players played star students of their school, one of them from a rich ancient family, the other the perfect prefect. They decided beforehand their characters didn't like each other but... They just went head to head all the time, trading insults an riling each other up. 
Maybe the words: ""scared, potter?"" Where uttered by one of them bc it just fit so perfectly 😭
4. How exhausted I would be. Seriously, if you are somebody who regularly GM's... You're a champ, thanks for putting all of that work into it for your players. 
I'll definitely tell MY GM's how much I appreciate all their work.

One of my players - lets call him Mike - created this sortof Judge Dredd character. For better or worse, he takes this role very seriously, and as a result has been trying to find excuses to kill the rest of the party for any crime, real or imagined.

In the first session, one player missed 4 attacks in a row against an enemy. Mike attempted to use this as proof that they were colluding with the enemy, and shot him (non-fatally).

In the second session, two players decided to take a detour from the main mission to do some personal errands. Again, Mike decided that this was unacceptable - that the mission should always come first, and (again) strongly insinuated that he would kill them both if they didn't fall in line.

In the last session, Mike finally managed to pull a TPK off against the entire rest of the team. While the party was trapped in a pitch black room, some of the players were passing notes, and Mike decided that this was the final straw - evidently the rest of the party was colluding against him. He managed to find the lever to open the escape hatch, dropped out, then threw a pack of grenades back into the room, killing everyone.

xfwq5x,"My epiphany: Whiff up, not down.","There are probably people or even game systems that recommend this, but I hadn't seen this idea before and it seems so broadly applicable that I though it was worth sharing: Whiff up, not down -- and by that, I mean, when you blow a roll which normally means spectacular failure, use the opportunity to describe how competent the foe or challenge is, not how the action itself was poor.

I expect a lot of us had had many situations where you horribly miss an attack or a save or a check or whatever, and the default reaction is to describe it as an amateurish or laughable effort -- the orc warrior comes at the PC and rolls a 2 for her attack (she practically dropped her sword!) or the rogue flubs the saving throw against the trap (they didn't even see or hear the darts as they launched from the hole in the wall!). But by doing this, you cheapen the challenge and drag everyone down, narratively speaking.

Instead, use the botch to describe how impressive those involved are. ""The orc's sword swing was almost lazy with confidence from probably having cut through dozens of militia with same powerful cut, but as you parry it, you see the glint in her eye as she smiles and adjusts her stance, recognizing a foe worth her time"".  ""You hear the darts and begin to drop out of the way before the first two even clear the hole, but as you are about to hit the ground you see the third dart, intentionally aimed low and wide, just as it hits your leg: this trap was designed by someone who knew what they where doing"".

Then when the players succeed, they will feel that the foes were worthy challenges -- or if they fail, that their fate may have been deserved against such competence. And the advice isn't limited to GMs. As a player, the more you glow up your opponent, the more epic the encounter will be.

And yes, there are certainly characters or situations or games where incompetence is the shtick, so in those embrace the clown show. But for games about heroes or epic deeds or tough challenges, it usually behooves everyone at the table to embellish, not denigrate, their opposition.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28966fec0>,rpg,1663347520.0

q3ppvz,"Why I dislike ""Become a better GM"" guides (rant)","I'm usually the GM, but not always.  
One of the reasons I'm usually the GM is that many people are scared about being it.  
People think they're not good enough, don't know the system well enough, or lots of other reasons.  
This means all the ""Be a better GM"" tips would be great, right?  
I've developed the opposite view. All these guides and attitude does is pushing more and more responsibility to one person at the table.

If you're 5 people at the table, why should 1 of you be responsibile for 90% of the fun. I feel this attitude is prevalent among lots of people. Players sit down and expect to be entertained while the GM is pressured to keep the game going with pacing, intrigue, fun, rules and so on.

If you're a new GM, why should you feel bad for not knowing a rule if none of the players know it?  
If the table goes quiet because no one interacts with each other, why is it the GM's job to fix it?  
If the pacing sucks, why is it the GM's fault? I'd bet that in most cases pacing sucks when the players aren't contributing enough.

I'd love to see some guides and lists on ""How to be a better RPG group"".

A few of my friends heard that I created [a game](https://a-smouldering-lighthouse.itch.io/this-spells-trouble) and wanted to try it out. We don't know each other through the RPG world -- most of them weren't even familiar with D&D. So it was a happy surprise that they were interested, and an even bigger surprise when they picked a date and invited me to watch.

I met them (online) on Saturday night. They had all kinds of fun and silly ideas they wanted to explore, and they quickly got the hang of the game's rules and structure. I had a great time watching their weird adventure -- but that's not really the point of this post. It's what happened right after they finished that made me laugh.

They were debriefing, talking about what they liked and happily reflecting on their story. They said they wanted to tell stories like this again. Then one of the players completely new to RPGs said this:

> A Great Visit with Rick...

Since this Gofundme started, Rick has been in ICU and we have been unable to really speak to him. Yesterday his was able to have visitors, and his sisters spent quite a few hours with him and bring up to date on family matters and they told him about the wonderful response he was getting from his friends and comrades in the gaming community to the Gofundme. He was very relived to hear that some of his bills were going to be taken care of and certainly helped diminish some of his worries about his sisters and it lifted his spirits!

Today I spent several hours with Rick to discuss and ask about various business matters. Of course his first question to me when I arrived was ""How much is it now?"" ""A bit over $25,000 , I told him.""

The most wonderful thing about my visit was that I sat with him and read almost every comment that you had all posted in the comments section. Rick got comments from Spain, Japan, The Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, the UK, Australia, Mexico and others. I would tell him the country if the commenter had listed it. He had not heard or read any of those yet, and he recognized many of your names. There were certainly times that some of your comments brought tears to his eyes, and he would often comment ""how gratifying it was to hear such things being said about me.""

So now I can confirm that Rick has indeed heard your comments and is very, very grateful and humbled by your outpouring of care and love!

Finally it was time for me to leave and Rick asked ""What is it now?"" I got my phone and checked. ""Wow, its $27,000 Rick!"" He smiled. ""See you tomorrow?"" ""Ok - I'll stop by to keep you updated."" I replied.

Yes, it was a great day for Rick - thanks to all of you!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28a08daf0>,rpg,1566071968.0
pmwqjz,How do you handle horny DM making you uncomfortable?,"Not even sure if this is the right place to post. 
 
I was excited to start a new DnD campaign with a group I adventured with a few years ago. The DM and his girlfriend have been in the campaign together both times, and both times he privately messaged me about sexual topics. He claimed his girlfriend was open to him discussing these topics with me, but I didn’t believe him and it still made me uncomfortable. I quit the first time because of this, and now I quit again. I wanted to disclose this to someone in the group, but I felt like I would be responsible for the group falling apart if I did. Either way, it really sucks. My group must think I’m a flake, but that’s not the whole truth.

I know I'm probably preaching to the choir, but I get annoyed whenever I see a post on this subreddit that's clearly about D&D, but doesn't explicitly say so. ""I'm thinking of multi-classing into warlock, is that viable?"" On my daily scroll through here, I more often than not see one of these posts, and it really gets my goat.

I like D&D as much as the next person, but I like this subreddit because I can talk about other games I enjoy, learn about new systems to try, and yes, hate on how tired I get of 5e. The blind assumption that RPG always equals D&D is disruptive and a bit insulting. I've got no problem with D&D posts—heck, I can engage more with them than a lot of more niche ones—but I wish they'd be explicit and not assume everyone knows the so-called ""world's greatest RPG.""

Now, I'd guess most of the ""implicit D&D post"" people are new here, and I probably sound like an old man yelling at clouds.

I created a small website with different kind of name generators.
You can find it at the following address:
 
https://alxgiraud.github.io/fantasygen

The first tab uses **Markov chain procedural algorithm** to make coherent chains of values.

You can use the existing presets but also customize the dictionary. This algorithm can generate any kind of word (e. g. NPC names, towns, planets, monsters, religions, etc.).

You can customized the expected result. A lower order will increase the randomness. 

The other tabs (except Taverns) mostly use guidelines from **Gary Gygax's Extraordinary Book of Names**.

**Generic Fantasy** tab generates random names that can be used for any generic character names (heroes, villains, main protagonist, etc.).

**Fantastic Species** tab generates names for a specific race. 
You may find two alternatives for a same species. It could be useful to distinguishing two different kind of populations/tribes (e. g. Wood and High elves).

**Groups** tab generates names for Mystic Orders, Military Units and Thieves & Assassin group. They could also be used for any group of adventurers or guilds.

**Taverns** tab generates... well... tavern names. I simply implement what is defined on this D&D wiki page: https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Well_Over_100_Tavern_Names_(DnD_Other)#Totally_Random

***

So uh, yeah. This is a project that ballooned in scope a bit.

I'm proud to present Dataterm, a ""in-universe"" website for my game of the Cyberpunk Red tabletop RPG. The setting for it is Montréal, Canada in the year 2023. It is set in my interpretation of the universe of the old-school RPG Cyberpunk 2020. Currently, my players are on warpath after being fired as police detectives, after the megacorporation they were investigating managed to meddle and find loopholes in the law to get them out of police protection.

&nbsp;

On Dataterm, I wanted my players to have access to the daily ""screamsheets"" (constantly updated newspaper printed on cheap thermal paper) as well as the ""Public Database"", a NET aggregator that allows them to look up things in the lore. If you speak Molière's language, feel free to read those parts of the website! I love writing that stuff.

&nbsp;

On the English version, you'll find a few of the screamsheets I translated as well as *some* homebrew content on a few enemy NPC ideas I had running around in my head.

You'll notice a few of the things that I do to convey worldbuilding AND game information. The ads on the website use game mechanics to tell players how to use these products as well as tell them how they work within the setting. The ""screamsheets"" themselves allow me to push these ads with interesting info, as well as tidbits of worldbuilding information. In addition, most of the articles on these screamsheets are linked in some way to what they do in their campaign: the articles report on shoot outs they took part in, events that they know details about and even, sometimes, people they have met.

&nbsp;

The website doesn't have much on it yet, but my ambition is to slowly build it into a great platform for homebrew content and community resources for the Cyberpunk Red community. It's a very unique setting and the community is only now exploding, so this is my way of giving back to the community.

&nbsp;

Anyway, I wanted to share this fun project with the r/RPG community, I figured you guys would like it and get inspired.

&nbsp;

jmo4ra,"OK guys, you ruined D&D for me.","You bastards, opened my eyes and I can't...Whenever I run my current campaign, I can't help but feel how 5e rule set is flawed for the campaign I run. 

Finally, yesterday I ran CoC 7e The haunting oneshot for other group of friends (who never played TTRPG before!)...We expected 4 hours most, but it went for 7 hours, till 3:00, we were sleepy but everyone wanted to solve the mystery and get rid of Corbitt! It was a murderhouse, PCs got killed 4 times due to unlucky rolls and overconfidence. 

It was really refreshing, for the first time for a long time I've felt something new, and the rules... They actually supported the story!  And the fighting, it felt so dynamic, the way every conflicting side during the attack can have some sort of an action felt interesting, and it worked quite nicely. I didn't expect that, I got used to one-sided turns in D&D

It felt so fluid and even strange. Because I came to the point on my 1.5 years of my D&D career, where only 20% of my games are actual combat, but 80% of the rules of D&D are about the combat! 


Now I just...Want to stop my campaign with all kinds of stories in it? And just grab different systems and play short campaigns, so every system I'd use would be honed for a particular story, like for 2-3 months each. 

Sadly...I am afraid, I can't force myself tell my players that I want to stop. They really enjoy my games, and we just started a new campaign like 1.5 months ago. I know that half of them wouldn't switch and prefer to leave the table. I am afraid that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Because I love my players :(

Update: I proposed to my players DW, 2 out of 3 players happily agreed to keep the story but switch the system, after I told them that it's tedious for me to run D&D.  I made an essay of 4 pages long to express myself and express my feelings.

2oa9bg,[D&D 3.5] I had the absolute worst session ever last night.,"About a week ago the brother of a co-worker of mine invited me to play in his group's new D&D 3.5 campaign. I already have a regular Pathfinder game but I figured why the heck not? Make new friends, be able to game more, yay! :D

I rolled up a third level rogue and went over to the DM's house (not the guy who invited me) ready to play. The group was all men older than me (mid-20s), four of them including the DM. After being introduced to everyone I felt really good about this because they all seemed very nice and also excited to a.) have a new player and b.) finally have a rogue in the group.

What. A. Total. Disaster.

First of all, the DM didn't know the rules. For example: we opened with a combat (no role-playing or setup, he literally just dropped us into a combat). I had the initiative so I went to backstab one of the orcs who we had stumbled across. The DM said I couldn't backstab him because I wasn't behind him. I told him that he was flat-footed so I could backstab him.

Player 1: ""Oh here we go, she's a rules lawyer guys...""

??? A ""rules lawyer""? Just for knowing that really obvious rule? Anyway, the DM said that the orc wasn't flat-footed. I pointed out that since he had not gone yet that, yes, he was. He overruled me. So, fine, no backstab. I rolled to hit and missed. The entire group, even Player 2 (the brother of my co-worker) laughed at me.

Laughed at me. For rolling bad. 

It got worse from there:

1. Apparently the DM doesn't allow attacks of opportunity. Neat. So there goes all the usefulness of my Combat Reflexes feat. 

2. The DM cast a ""dominate"" spell on me. I was not allowed a save. Not even a roll. Why? Because ""this guy is just too powerful"". Not even with a Nat-20.

3. For the rest of the combat he had my half-elf rogue talk like a valley girl during her turn and flirt with the players 1-3 rather than do, well, anything.

Finally the combat ended and now it was time to officially meet the group. Everyone in the group, all of good alignments (including one LG Paladin!) just mocked my character with bad valley-girl voices. When I replied in my character's normal voice the DM decreed that no, the Dominate spell had made it so I could only speak in that ""accent"" now (e.g. ""Like, totally guys? This is like, soooo super cool!""). Basically he made it so that my rogue, with her 14 Intelligence, was now an air-head.

Fine, fine. Sometimes these things can be fun, right? So I played along. Bad idea.

Next, during a short break, I asked the DM if I could change my Combat Reflexes feat since he didn't allow AOO. He said nope: he doesn't allow ""retraining"".

Back at the table, I try to RP with the group, now in my new ditsy/valley-girl persona. It did not go well at all. The half-orc in the group apparently hates elves and I'm close enough to being a full elf for him to great me like shit. But at least he actually role-played a little: the other players just kept making jokes about the size of my character's breasts (even though when I described her I never said they were large). 

Finally we got to the actual mission for the session. We had to help a local Baron recover his family's ancestral sword, which had been stolen by a group of bugbears led by a ""mysterious figure"". For once, the DM let me do what I wanted: I asked to sense the baron's motives. I rolled a 17 on the die and he immediately said I believed him. Checking my sheet I said, ""With my ranks in Sense Motive that's actually a 25."" He said, ""Too late, you believe him."" At that point Player 1 said, ""I'm going to Sense Motive, too."" He rolled a 13 on his die but with his ranks/bonus got an 18. So the DM took him aside to tell him, basically, that the Baron was hiding something from us.

Frustrated, I continued to play. We had a random encounter with some sort of lizard-thing (forget its name) and this time I couldn't backstab because I'd ""have to be on top of him"" to stab his back and you're not allowed to enter an enemy's square unless you grapple. Fine, fine.

That's when Player 3 began rolling for me. Yep, he just upped and started rolling for me. Granted, I hadn't been rolling very well in combat. But when one of my last turns in that combat came I said I was attacking and he, sitting to my left, grabbed my die and rolled it. Of course, he rolled high and I finally hit. So the group decided that he should roll for me the rest of the session (if not forever).

Eventually we reached an old graveyard that our ranger had tracked the bugbears to. I asked if I could make a Knowledge: Local roll to see if I knew anything about this graveyard (ooc I was thinking *undead*!). Nope, not allowed, even though in my backstory ""local"" to me was this very barony. So yeah, we walked into a graveyard and sure enough? Undead everywhere.

Player 1 went down, but didn't die. Player 2 (the co-worker's brother) went down and SHOULD have died but the DM said that a magical wisp appeared before him just as he was about to die and healed him back to full strength. WTF? 

At this point, with the situation so dire and this group decidedly not cool, I decided to get the fuck away. On my next turn I said I was using withdraw to run the fuck away from the skeleton I was barely hurting anyway (slashing weapon). The DM decreed that my character wouldn't do that. This time I said, ""Yes, she would. She knows a losing battle when she sees it."" He said, ""Give me an Intelligence check, then."" I rolled a 19!!! Best roll of the night. With my +2 INT that made it a 21. DM? ""Nope, you're too stupid to realize you should run.""

So I attack. Miss.

Next turn I'm down to three hitpoints. I try to withdraw again but the DM says I can't. Not even a roll this time, I simply am not allowed to. So as a free action I yell out, ""Uhm, guys?!?! I like, totally think we need to get out of here, ya know!?"" and then I stab at the skeleton again, hit, but do only one point of damage due to damage reduction.

The skeleton fighting me kills me on its next turn. Not unconscious, DEAD. -12 hitpoints. Meanwhile only one player is still up (the one the wisp saved for some random, stupid reason). He decides to bolt. The DM let him.

And that's where the session ended. Everybody dead except for that guy. The DM said to us at the end, ""Don't worry, next session I have a great plan for how you guys actually survived.""

??? I literally stared at him as I packed up my dice and papers and stuff. Then I said, ""There won't be a next time for me.""

""Oooo she's mad,"" somebody said. ""Characters die, hon. Don't get upset about it. It's just a game.""

""Games are supposed to be fun,"" I said in reply. And then I left.

This morning I received a text from my co-worker's brother asking if I was mad. I replied to say, ""Just disappointed. I wanted to play D&D last night. That was not D&D."" He has not responded.

Anyway... that was easily the worst, biggest waste of time I've ever experienced at a gaming table. But *please* feel free to tell me if I'm overreacting for not wanting to EVER game with those guys again. Oh, and also feel free to share your ""worst sessions"" here, too! Finally... thanks for reading if you made it this far! :D

**tl;dr**: New group, no rules, bad experience. Your turn!

**edit** Sneak attack, not backstab!!! It's been a long time since I played a rogue and everyone last night was calling it backstab so it sort of stuck. Also? My rolls are estimates.

I am an idiot, so I wrote a microRPG, designed to be played in one sitting, about both Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 and the ""extended universe"" lore created in DeathBlart. It ... might not make any sense if you haven't seen the movie, but also, take this as an opportunity to guess what on Earth the plot of Paul Blart 2 is based on these context clues. It's really dumb and uses a bunch of d12s, so please enjoy [the game in all of its ill-conceived glory](http://mpburdick.com/Blart.pdf).

Don't watch Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2.

o5jvw0,How my therapist prescribed TTRPGs and they healed my soul.,"**TLDR: TTRPGs are more than just games and are extremely therapeutic. You should be proud to be a creator or player, because if it wasn’t for people like you, I would probably be in a far worse place.** 

I was born with a rare liver disease that has symptoms similar to muscular dystrophy. I was never able to keep up with other kids in any physical activity. Through most of elementary school I was bullied for being overweight, slow, etc. and then I found...Advanced D&D (second edition). 

&#x200B;

I dove in and could do what I never could in life, even as simple as run away from a bad guy. There was a sense of catharsis. I found myself loving the idea of creating my own world that valued each person for who they are, not judged them by their weaknesses. 

&#x200B;

I started DMing when I was 8 and was home brewing even back then. Being raised in a strict conservative religious home, I spent most of my youth sneaking out to RPG with my friends. RPGs were my way to process, vent, experience, and create without the judging eyes or limitations. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to when I got married. It was a very emotionally toxic relationship, and she was very controlling. So, she demanded that I give up my gaming. Being the dutiful husband I did. As things got worse in my marriage, I found myself having horrible nightmares where I was hurting people I cared about and it scared me. 

&#x200B;

I ended up seeing a therapist with a binder full of the different archetypes from my dreams and how they manifested in me. (Looking back now I see that I was creating characters). Needless to say, he was overwhelmed and just started talking about what I used to love to do. As we talked about my experiences with TTRPGs, he lit up and grabbed a prescription pad. He prescribed TTRPGs to help me make sense of all the chaos in my real life and keep me grounded.

&#x200B;

I was overjoyed, but had no books, gaming group, or any way to get started. I posted a LFG flyer on my local game store bulletin board (Yes  I am that old), but my mind was racing filled with stories, lands, species, creatures, situations, puzzles, adventures, etc. So, I started creating my own game called Rupture. It wasn't long before I started to gain control of my emotions, value myself, and feel excited for life again. My toxic marriage ended after 11 years, and I have been single for longer than that. 

&#x200B;

There have been times that TTRPGs have been put on the back burner in my life for other ""important"" things, but never for very long. Playing RPGs and creating Rupture allowed me to use my imagination to heal my soul. As I continue to develop the game with my amazing team and community, I can’t be grateful enough to everyone involved because of how meaningful and impactful this has been for me.  

&#x200B;

But beyond my story, I see how by giving people an opportunity to play TTRPGs, we help others reach their subconscious in an instant because they are in the safer realm of imagination. Through imaginative play, TTRPGs are better equipped to empower than most mediums, allowing people to release their demons and pains in a safe experience that heals much faster than trying to find a way past logical walls they have built hoping to protect themselves from hurt in their regular life. 

&#x200B;

I am so grateful for the healing and enlightenment I have gotten from creating and playing rpgs, and if I can give a piece of that to one person so that it touches them in a positive way like it has done for me, then as a creator and player that’s the greatest reward anyone can ask for.

&#x200B;

Believe or not...this is the short version. I am always happy to share more about me if you’re interested. Just ask! :) . 

&#x200B;

I know this was long… so I really appreciate you taking the time to read my story. 

&#x200B;

35fpdj,[System] Actual Cannibal Shia Labeouf,"# Actual Cannibal Shia Labeouf

## A Two Page RPG 

*You’re walking in the woods. There’s no one around and your phone is dead. Out of the corner of your eye you spot him…*

***Shia Labeouf***

*He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint! He’s gaining on you!”*

### **Premise**

You are one of the unlucky ones. You have been caught up in a deadly struggle with Shia Labeouf. Band together with other strangers to escape, outwit and possibly even kill Shia Labeouf.


### **Character Creation**

You will need :-

* A name
* A brief description of your character
* An item you have in your possession.

### **How to Play**

Your character can be anyone. Unless the Shia Master (SM) specifically stipulates it during an action, your general fitness and body shape won’t limit you in any particular way. The item in your possession can be virtually anything with the exception of the following:

* A working cellphone or other communication device.
* Large quantities of ammo.
* Items that immediately and completely resolve the situation.
* Paper bags with which to trap Shia Labeouf.

Each character begins play with 5 blood tokens. These represent your wellbeing. As you are attacked and move through various challenges, you will lose blood tokens. When your Shia Master (SM) requires it, roll a D6. If the number is equal or greater than your current number of blood tokens, you lose one, which is discarded into the centre of the table. Once you lose all five, the next attack will be fatal.The only goal is to survive and escape the scenario you are in. Shia Labeouf will hunt you as long as you remain in the vicinity. The item you have can possibly aid you in some way, though your SM will determine how helpful it is in a given situation. 

Actions are taken in the following order - The GM describes the scene -> The players offer their actions -> the GM will give how the environment and Shia respond to them. Once the new situation has been described, the cycle repeats.

Good luck….






## **SM’s Section**

This is a little or no prep one-shot RPG. Character creation takes about 60 seconds. This is a collaborative story-telling game and has no stats and uses only a single die to do every significant action. Descriptiveness is encouraged! It’s unlikely the game will last more than 2 hours.

Shia Labeouf is fast, powerful and possibly naked. Think the bastard son of Jason and Mike Myers with the cruelty of Freddy Krueger and the speed and power of the Wolfman. He hunts mercilessly and will not stop until he has tasted blood and consumed the flesh of his quarry. Gently guide your players by describing the areas they are in. Unless their actions are completely ridiculous, allow them to attempt them. Success is automatic but blood tokens are not unlimited. For game purposes Shia Labeouf has a minimum of 5 +[2x the number of players] in blood tokens, though the number can be adjusted by the SM if they wish to increase the challenge.

If the players attack Shia, either directly or with environmental hazards, remove one of his blood tokens then have him retreat to give the players a brief respite. If the players somehow manage to deplete all of Shia’s tokens, they are victorious but forever scarred by their horrifying experience.  If a player dies as a result of expending all their blood tokens, these discarded tokens are added to Shia’s total as he consumes the body, bones and all! Of course, while he feasts, the players can flee unimpeded. Interrupting his feeding will greatly anger Shia and cause him to target the interrupter more viciously than the others.

Each scenario is an exercise in improvisation for the SM. You are given a setting and expected to run with it in whatever direction Shia chases your players. Think of it as a particularly tongue in cheek horror film. Vivid descriptions are key, whereas maps and miniatures are discouraged. You describe a scene, the players respond and you insert Shia's actions where appropriate. Players roll for actions that may result in harm, physical or mental. This game is not intended to be fair to the players.  People will die. If the players manage to get into a safe situation (locked in a safe room, trapping Shia permanently) you can expend 2 of his blood tokens to cause a **Shia Surprise!** where he escapes the situation, however implausible his escape may be. Do not allow the players a huge amount of time to think or plan. More than five minutes of safety should be interrupted, using a **Shia Surprise!** if necessary. Feel free to play on horror story cliches and make the game as serious or silly as you wish. Silly is kind of inevitable though. 

Some locations  are given below to get you started. Flip a coin for the left or right column then roll a d6 to decide the nightmare that awaits your players!

6yi2y0,Only two students caught what I just did,"I teach Bible, history, and English at a private school. While I'm confident in two of those areas, I've never taught history before in any capacity, so it's been a grand experiment. Today, however, I gave my students [this paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CrvoSsYJwI_fc-tZN4LhLGEIQ_l8dP3FW6f074grbwU/edit?usp=sharing), and they *loved* it. I overheard them talking about it after class and in the cafeteria.

Two of them said, ""This is just like a roleplaying game,"" though they don't play (I may have to fix that before the year is out). And everyone else spent about 10 minutes of class time asking what they choices they were allowed to make. Every time, I said ""You can do what you want, but know that there are consequences for your actions."" 

This paper seems to be a big hit, so if you want to suggest similar scenarios for me to use, I'll be sure to give you credit when the time comes. I cover from the fall of Rome through the High Middle Ages for the ninth graders, and I cover post-civil war for tenth through twelfth graders.

105euuu,"Rant: ""Group looking for a GM!""","Partially inspired by the recent posts on a lack of 5e DMs. 

I saw this recently on a local FB RPG group:

>Looking for a DM who is making a D&D campaign where the players are candy people and the players start at 3rd level. If it's allowed, I'd be playing a Pop Rocks artificer that is the prince of the kingdom but just wants to help his kingdom by advancing technology and setting off on his own instead of being the future king.

That's an extreme example, but nothing makes me laugh quite so much as when a fully formed group of players posts on an LFG forum asking someone to DM for them -- even better if they have something specific picked out. Invariably, it's always 5e.

The obvious question that always comes to mind is: ""why don't you just DM?""

There's a bunch of reasons, but one is that there's just unrealistic player expectations and a passive player culture in 5e. When I read a post like that, it screams ""ENTERTAIN ME!"" The type of group that posts an LFG like that is the type of group that I would never want to GM for. High expectations and low commitment.

t82gum,"Playing D&D In Ukraine, How And Why We Actually Didn't","Sunday's coming, are we going to meet and play? Yes! Sure! We should do it! Let's gather! Let's have fun!

So we gather. While we're at it, mister president says (presumably, there have been warnings about possible fakes and personally I didn't hear him, but pesumably) that the russian bombers are going to attack the city. Does it bother us? A little, because times are what they are, but we're still gonna play, so let's hit the supermarket and get some snacks and play!

Supermarket number one is part of a popular chain, the goods are significantly cheaper than in other stores, probably that's why there's almost nothing on the shelves. Bread is there, though. Looks like people who were hoarding bread have finally filled their caves and now they lie on huge mounds of bread, dreaming, tiny flickers of fire escaping from their nostrils, filling the air with the delicate smell of French toast.

But we want some snacks, so we go to another supermarket, less cheap but more fulfilling.

""Oh, damn it. Air raid alarm"".

The alarm sound comes from several directions - many people have the app for it installed on their phones. Should we move to the shelter? Probably, but we've come together and we want to play! Besides, it'll probably be over when we get to the apartment!

So we get the snacks, and we get to the apartment, and the alarm is over. Yay! A swig or two of non-alcoholic beer - for the victory, for Putin's coffin, for the victory again.

In two minutes the alarm sounds again.

""Maybe we should go to the shelter"".

""But we just got here!""

""Look, all I'm saying is you probably shouldn't sit next to the window"".

""All I'm saying is we're probably in the safest city in the region"".

""And probably in the safest district in the city"".

""But shouldn't we go to the shelter?""

""Uh, FINE!""

""Maybe we shouldn't?""

""If it calms people down, fine, let's go, let's take a look at it"".

And we're off to see the shelter, the wonderful shelter from bombs. It looks depressing. Also more than a little claustrophobic. I find a chair and declare that I'm not moving from it, while the others are discussing if they should have a quick game of Munchkin. They also check their phones and tell me that a russian fighter had been shot down. The shelter fills  with a triumphant roar.

The alarm is over, then it starts again, then it's over again. I refuse to budge from my chair, but my decision is overruled by the majority. Traitors!

We return to the apartment.

""So take a look, this is list of titles, cool, huh?""

""Mmhm. Oh, yeah, nice"".

""What's that, a primitive name generator?""

""... Yes"".

""Nice, nice"".

""... You can play someone named Satan the Most Unpleasant, isn't that cool?""

""Hey everyone, there's a funny video about international sanctions on Tiktok!""

Everyone takes turns watching the funny video.

""So are we going to play something?""

""I've got the Forbidden Psalm"".

""What's that?""

""It's a wargame"".

""Ugh, wargames. It's all about math and measuring things with a ruler"".

""But there's this cool character generation thing...""

""Do we need a D20? Should I put these dice away?""

""We can use these, no problem, the rules can always be fixed. Look, I know you're a purist...""

""I'm a what?""

""I mean you have read the rules and you remember them for some unknown reason"".

""I know the reason!""

""I don't"".

""Look, last time you tried to use the system but you don't know how many cool things are written in the rules!""

""My point exactly"".

""So are we going to play?""

""Hey guys, they've blocked the transit movement from here to here"".

""Have they, huh? Let's see how we can get to Bulgaria if things get really ugly now... this looks promising, only here's a swamp and here's a bridge...""

""You know what, we can just keep this up, just talking and laughing and whatever"".

""Yeah, well, I thought we would play"".

""Maybe another time. Do you think we'll win by next Sunday?""

""I think the day after tomorrow would be perfect. 8th of March - Victory Day, everyone celebrates"".

""Stalin died in March, didn't he?""

""Sure did"".

""Man, I wish N. was here, he's always so thoughtful"".

""He's deeply prorussian. He's probably going through a cognitive dissonance right now"".

""Hope he can get through it"".

""Hope he can"".

Curfew is drawing closer, so we split the party, some of us stay and some of us leave to feed the cats and catch up with the work and get ready for whatever the future brings.

""I've sometimes wondered if I could kill a human being. Now I'm certain that I can. I'm not sure I wanted to know this about myself"".

""But it's good to know that"".

""It's interesting to know that"".

""Maybe we'll be able to play next time"".

""If things turn out good for us"".

""We'll manage"".

""Sure we will"".

So we didn't play a role-playing game this time. I blame Vladimir Putin for it. But we got together, we talked a good talk and laughed, we inspected the bomb shelter and we're ready, more or less, to keep on working and fighting for the future.

So that one day we can go back to playing D&D in Ukraine.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28bcb2b40>,rpg,1646584422.0

Sometimes, it would be hard to distinguish roleplay from out of game questions, especially since my players don’t do voice or accents often (which is totally valid). By starting questions with a key phrase or word, it can help your game avoid confusing “is this real or RP” moments. Just don’t take a god title too seriously lol.

c4d0a1,Controversial Opinion: Creating your own RPG is pretty easy and everyone should try it.,"One mantra that I hear tossed around here and on /r/RPGdesign is that you shouldn't try to make your own RPG unless you are very experienced and have played a lot of RPGs.

This is nonsense.

While playing a lot of RPGs is very helpful (I love reading how other people have solved difficult design problems) you definitely DON'T need to be some kind of expert to start designing. I run games with 10 year olds every week, and got them started on my game [Maze Rats](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197158/Maze-Rats?affiliate_id=379088). Within weeks, they were coming to me with stories of games that they had played at home, DMing for their parents and siblings.

In almost every case, they had immediately begun hacking the rules. One kid even stapled together his own blank pamphlet and had started writing down the rules he'd come up with. Mr. Milton had done it, so how hard could it be?

Did their rules have problems? Probably, but who cares? After a while they would discover those problems for themselves, figure out how to solve them, and *teach themselves game design in the process*.

The idea that RPG design is some ultra-arcane process whose secrets are reserved for only the most dedicated and obsessed RPG fans is *really dumb*. Your game does not need to do anything original. It does not need to solve a particular problem. It does not need to ""innovate"" or ""push the medium forward"". You and your friend just have to enjoy it, and you have to be willing to change course and make corrections as you go. 5th graders can do it. You can do it too.

In the early days of DnD, the assumption was that DMs were not only creating their own worlds and building their own megadungeons for players to explore, but also that everyone was gradually building up their own custom ruleset that worked for them (it was also kind of inevitable, given how confusing the OD&D rules were). Game Design was inextricably entangled with being a dungeon master. The modern perceived divisions between those roles is not healthy for the hobby, in my opinion. They're just rules! Nothing will happen if you make your own!

So make a heartbreaker! Recreate DnD all over again! Make some experimental monstrosity that breaks every rule of RPGs! Enjoy yourself and learn something in the process. No one can stop you.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28c97f830>,rpg,1561327707.0

It was intense, and everyone was shouting and laughing throughout the entire session.

Afterwards, while I was cleaning up the table, a player asked me ""How was the session?"". Usually, I ask the players this question, so that I can improve as a GM and learn what my players enjoyed the most.

I told the player that I had fun and everyone else seemed to be enjoying the game as well, so I'd consider it a good session. I've been thinking about his question a lot today, and how it felt good as a GM to know that my players care if I am having fun too.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28cc95070>,rpg,1624810326.0

He was surprised to hear our show records from the same town. He told his editors, and they sent a veteran reporter and professional photographer to our high-tech, recording studio (aka dusty basement with inflatable pool toys). The photographer took tons of pictures with this constant stunned look on his face, as he could not fathom what the hell a role-playing game really was. The reporter, meanwhile, spent two hours rigorously hammering us with brutal, hard-hitting questions like *""How much fun do you have?""*, risky personal questions like *""Do you all get along in this game?""*, and highly-technical questions such as *""What are those weird dice for?""*

Sure, not a lot of newspaper readers are hip to role-playing podcasts…or podcasts in general…or the internet, but it’s still pretty damn cool to see us in the paper.

wrbg4v,Dark skinned elves in Fantasy settings,"My tabletop gaming group is having a huge argument this week because a dark-skinned elf was introduced to our fantasy world.

I live in a very conservative area, and it's next to impossible to fill a group up with players who align 100% with my politics. Usually that isn't a problem, because fantasy is great escape from real world bullshit including politics, but not this time. 

Two players, both ardent Trump supporters for what it's worth, have taken great issue with the elf being in our fantasy world. They claim that we're forcing our ""BS politics"" down their throat and that only Drow Elves (evil elves that dwell underground, for those of you who aren't familiar) can have dark skin. 

It's gotten as silly as them citing passages from J.R.R. Tolkien where he describes elves as being fair-skinned. It's been distressing, because it's otherwise a fun group of people to game with. But currently this issue threatens to tear the group apart. 

I've tried my best to explain the idea of representation being important, and fantasy being an individual thing, and who cares if an elf/gnome/dwarf looks Asian/Black/Latino or whatever.

wbw2gx,Driving to Gen Con? Read this.,"Lots of you will be driving cross-country this week to Indianapolis for Gen Con. Unfortunately, you’ll also be driving home - and you’re way more likely to be exhausted. I’m a fatigue & alertness consultant when not designing games, so this seems like a good time to pull out my standard semi-annual advice to keep you alive. Feel free to share.

For people driving (or gaming) on short sleep:

1. Most people need 7-9 hours of sleep to be well-rested. When you're getting less than that (as most people do), you're far more likely to suffer from something called ""microsleeps."" The less sleep you've had, the more likely it is that you'll experience these.

2. Microsleeps are periods when a wave of sleep washes over you, for anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. Often times, you may not even realize that you've been technically asleep; these can happen while your eyes are open. Don't remember the last five minutes of your drive, or your attention is wandering to things that aren't the road? You're suffering from microsleeps. 

3. Microsleeps can happen at any time, but they are MUCH more likely when you're sleep deprived. In a recent documentary, they kept someone up for 24 hours and had them drive around a test track for an hour. He remembers drowsing off twice; in actuality, he fell asleep 22 times, and only remembered 2 of them. This is happening to you, too. If you're sitting at a table, no one cares. If you're behind the wheel of a car, you're screwed.

4. At these times, your reaction time is awful. If you're on a flat straight empty road, you'll hopefully be okay. If the guy in front of you hits his brakes, though, you'll never be able to react in time. It's incredibly dangerous.

5. When you feel this starting to happen, pull the car over off the road, get into the passenger seat, and take a ten minute nap. Walmart parking lots are really good places for this, as they never mind.

6. Cold air, a blasting radio - these provide only momentary (and minuscule) boosts to your alertness. A short ""power nap"" is the only thing that will raise your alertness in the short term. Ten or fifteen minutes of shuteye will help you stay awake for the next 1-2 hours. Caffeine can help too, but isn't a perfect solution. For the greatest effect, take a ""coffee nap"": drink a cup of coffee and close your eyes for ten minutes. You'll wake up incredibly alert. (If you're falling asleep during a game, a 5 minute break with your eyes closed can help, as well.)

7. Remember, sleepiness comes in waves; you may be fine, then 20 minutes later you're ready to keel over. Sleep-related accidents are much more likely to occur with folks who have been up all night, then who drive farther than 20 minutes. The presence of daylight helps a great deal with your alertness, which is why the vast majority of fatigue-related accidents happen between 1am to 6 am, especially right around dawn.

8. Regarding reaction time and the ability to reason logically - studies have shown that after 22 hours without sleep (assuming a morning wake-up time), your performance is equivalent to someone with a .08 blood alcohol level. After 24 hours with no sleep, performance and mental acuity is equivalent to .10 - legally drunk. See, there's a reason you make stupid decisions when tired! And you don't want to know about how you do when you're tired AND drunk. If you're sleep-deprived, keep this in mind when thinking about what you're doing, especially if you have to drive.

9. Short naps (10-15 minutes, 20 minutes max) are great for short-term alertness boosts. Long naps (2-3 hours) are even better; they give you restorative sleep and can keep you going another 6-10 hours. Stay away from 1-hour naps. Due to the way your sleep patterns run, a 1-hour nap will often leave you feeling groggy and tired, when a shorter or longer nap will not. Neat, huh?

10. The amount of alertness you gain after 5 hours of sleep is significantly higher than the amount you gain after 4 hours. If you have a choice, you'll be a lot happier with that extra hour.

11. More than 3 cups of coffee (or doses of caffeine) doesn't make you any more alert; it just makes you more anxious, irritable and prone to stress. Keep your coffee intake spaced out, don't overdo it, and remember that caffeine stays really active in your body for roughly four hours after drinking it. If you try to sleep when caffeinated, your sleep quality will stink; for that reason, try to time your caffeine intake so that you stop drinking caffeine 3-4 hours before your anticipated bedtime.

There a ton more information that may help, but this is a decent fast primer. Be aware of your drowsiness when driving, and watch out for that mental sluggishness - recognizing it in time may be the best thing you do this coming weekend.

zedy31,5e DnD has a DM crisis,"[5e DnD has a DM crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr5gtvvkTe4)

The latest Questing Beast video (link above) goes into an interesting issue facing 5e players. I'm not really in the 5e scene anymore, but I used to run 5e and still have a lot of friends that regularly play it. As someone who GMs more often than plays, a lot of what QB brings up here resonates with me. 

&#x200B;

The people I've played with who are more 5e-focused seem to have a built-in assumption that the GM will do basically everything: run the game, remember all the rules, host, coordinate scheduling, coordinate the inevitable rescheduling when or more of the players flakes, etc. I'm very enthusiastic for RPGs so I'm usually happy to put in a lot of effort, but I do chafe under the expectation that I need to do all of this or the group will instantly collapse (which HAS happened to me).

&#x200B;

My non-5e group, by comparison, is usually more willing to trade roles and balance the effort. This is all very anecdotal of course, but I did find myself nodding along to the video. What are the experiences of folks here? If you play both 5e and non-5e, have you noticed a difference?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28dca1370>,rpg,1670351047.0

The very short summary is that OP feels frustrated because the group is falling apart because a player didn’t adequately communicate during session zero. 

There’s a persistent expectation in this hobby that the GM is the one who does everything: not just adjudicating the game, but also hosting and scheduling. In recent years, this has not extended to the GM being the one to go over safety tools, ensure everyone at the table feels as comfortable as possible, regularly check in one-on-one with every player, and also mediate interpersonal disputes.

This is a lot of responsibility for one person. Frankly, it’s too much. I’m not saying that safety tools are bad or that GMs shouldn’t be empathetic or communicative. But I think players and the community as a whole need to empathize with GMs and understand that no one person can shoulder this much responsibility.

xdk16y,WoTC files injunction against Ernie Gygax's TSR LLC,"*This situation involves hot-button issues, so let's all keeps our replies to each other respectful. Content warning: racism.*

You may remember Ernie Gygax founding his own TSR (a.k.a. ""NuTSR"") a few years back, based on a trademark claim that some found questionable. He then garnered lots of negative attention with tweets that many considered racist, transphobic, hostile, etc. ([story](https://gizmodo.com/tsr-games-distances-itself-from-ernie-g-gygax-jr-the-1847203067))

Well, NuTSR just released the beta of Star Frontiers RPG, which (shockingly) is chock full of racism, transphobia, and more. ([story](https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tsrs-star-frontiers-new-genesis-playtest-contains-racist-content))

The best/worst example is probably the ""Negro sub-race"" who have 30% lower (max) Intelligence than the also-playable ""Nordic sub-race"". Why? Well as the rules explain, ""Races in SFNG are not unlike races in the real world. Some are better at certain things than others, and some races are superior than others."" Yeeeeah. ([more examples here](https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tsrs-star-frontiers-new-genesis-playtest-contains-racist-content))

In response, WoTC has filed an injunction to stop its publication, asserting that NuTSR's use of the ""TSR"" trademark is invalid and tarnishes WoTC by association. ([story](https://www.geekwire.com/2022/wizards-of-the-coast-files-lawsuit-to-stop-publication-of-tabletop-game-alleging-trademark-violation-and-reprehensible-content/))

Whew.

Pretty sure I know what you're thinking, which is, ""Wait, aren't WoTC the ones in trouble for being racist?"" Well, yes, but that was a different story! In short, WoTC's newest Spelljammer book included the ""Hadozee"", a race of monkey-men who were uplifted into intelligence by civilized wizards and born into slavery. Oof. ([story](https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/spelljammer-race-controversy-hadozee))

So their stance may seem hypocritical, but I will at least give WoTC credit that they almost immediately apologized and revised the race's background completely. ([story](https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/spelljammer-hadozee-apology)) Does that absolve them? Heck no, because stuff like this *just keeps happening* with WoTC. However, I'm very glad that they're on the right side in ***this*** specific situation . . . and I think we can all agree that Star Frontier's blatant racism is worse than any slip-up WoTC has made.

\--------

EDIT: Well, I didn't intend for Hadozee discussion to dominate this thread. I was only mentioning it because it'd be really weird (disingenuous, even) to discuss WoTC going after a company for being racist and *not* acknowledging that WoTC has had racism issues themselves. I already said this in my last paragraph, but I guess I'll repeat myself? *WoTC's ""accidentally racist"" content pales in comparison to TSR's blatant, intentional racism.* 

Also, if you don't understand why people got upset about the Hadozee or think ""it's just because they were monkey-men bards"", please click the freaking ([story](https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/spelljammer-race-controversy-hadozee)) link next to that paragraph and actually *read* what the issues are.

Whether you're a player, a designer, or just curious what's out there, itch.io is full of resources that elevate small creators and make it easy to access cool stuff. The site's network of creators is constantly producing interesting and innovative games, tools, and modules.

When I talk to people who aren't familiar with itch.io's role in the RPG community, I like to compare it to Bandcamp: both platforms are indie-led, DRM-free ways of sharing your art and finding new creators.

Even just browsing itch.io's [physical games listed by new](https://itch.io/physical-games/newest), you're always going to find something interesting.

And so many games are being given away for cheap or free (though I recommend supporting the designers if you can!).

I don't want to do a compare-and-contrast with the relative merits of sites like DriveThruRPG or Kickstarter, but I do want to give credit where it's due: itch.io is smartly designed, friendly to creators and users, and has managed to attract a strong community of innovative designers.

l4ynmz,I Don't See How D&D 5e Is a Great RPG for Beginners,"I don't understand how 5e is supposed to be a beginner's game. It's ridiculously verbose and complex, while simultaneously severely lacking in actual content. The core rules are over 1,000 pages spread across 3 different books, and the system is riddled with contradictions and exceptions to the core rule system. And every class essentially feels like it was randomly copy-pasted from multiple separate games, running on different subsystems which further jumble and contradict the core rules of 5e. It's a mammoth task to wrap one's head around for the first time, especially if you've never even played an RPG before.

How exactly is 5e any better or easier for newcomers then, say, Old School Essentials, or Shadow of the Demon Lord? Both of which are far more streamlined and easier to grasp.

As far as I can tell, the only reason people laud 5e as a ""great gateway"" to the hobby is because of its popularity. Which, essentially, is a self fulfilling paradox.

fl8zpi,Introduced D&D to my Quarantined Kid,"With all of us stuck at home, I thought it might finally be time to try a practice game of D&D with my 5yo daughter. She took to videogames at a really young age, but I still wasn't sure if she would ""get"" tabletop roleplaying. Boy, was I wrong! She took to the spirit of it immediately. Her first combat encounter involved a couple of dog-sized spider creatures (she's terrified of spiders in real life.) She had a short sword, but still asked if her Dragonborn character could ""BITE the spider?"" I was like SHE SURE CAN! She's kicking spiders, stabbing them, throwing them. Really getting her aggression out on those poor spiders. Haha

Then later, I wanted to kind of teach her about climbing and stuff, so I had a goblin archer on a high ledge shooting down at her. I kept prompting her about climbing and jumping, but she asked ""can I roar at him really loud and try to scare him away?"" And she did! As a reward I had him drop the bow and arrow. She was so excited. She asked if there was a town where she could buy more arrows, and I couldn't have been prouder.

3ysh48,Fail Forward: How Han Solo failed almost every roll except the impossibly difficult ones,"tl;dr Han Solo is sympathetic because he whiffs on so many mundane actions while succeeding on the outlandish ones.
---

I think the concept of *failing forward* is one of the best things to happen to tabletop roleplaying in a long time. In essence, it means that when a player's dice come up as a failure, the character is able to at least somewhat accomplish their proximate goal though they incur a substantial hardship to be dealt with. The concept was explained to me in terms of Han Solo's choice of Lando Calrissian as someone to seek out for safety; technically, Han failed that roll, Bespin was a *bad* place to hide, but it led to a great and interesting story arc. Well, when you look at Han's other (mis)adventures, you see the same pattern, and it reminds me of the Pixar rule: 

   *""You admire a character for trying more than for their successes""*

Here is everything I could think of that would count as a roll for Han Solo through episodes 4, 5, and 6:

**A New Hope**

* Han tries to impress Kenobi with his Kessel Run performance, fails.
* Han tries to negotiate with Greedo, fails.
* Han tries to somehow outdraw the guy with the gun trained on him, succeeds!
* Han tries to spot the moon-sized base, then tries to free his ship from its tractor beam, fails, fails.
* Han tries to go undetected on a small, closed ship the empire knew he was hiding on, succeeds!
* Han tries to bluff his way through an explanation of the blaster fire in the prison block, fails.
* Han tries to stop the garbage compactor, fails.
* Han tries to make a stand against the stormtroopers in the hallway, fails and has to run away.
* Han declares he is coming out of nowhere to rescue Luke from imminent disaster in the middle of a battle, succeeds!
* Han fires on Darth Vader's TIE fighter squadron, fails forward.


**The Empire Strikes Back**

* Han fires on imperial scout drone trying to only wound it, critically succeeds, destroying it entirely so no data can be recovered.
* Han decides to go search for Luke when the odds of survival are 725 to 1, succeeds!
* Han attempts a rudimentary jump to hyperspace, fails.
* Han attempts to navigate an asteroid field when the odds of survival are 3,720 to 1, succeeds!
* Han tries to find a safe asteroid to land on, fails forward.
* Han attempts to charm a princess way out his league who said she'd rather kiss a wookiee, succeeds!
* Han tries to fly directly at a Star Destroyer, succeeds!
* Han tries to think of a safe place to hide out at, comes up with Lando Calrissian, fails forward.
* Han fires on Darth Vader, fails utterly.
* Han is captured, tortured and frozen in carbonite, uncertain if any of this requires a roll.


**Return of the Jedi**

* Han, completely blind, tries to locate the source of Jabba's voice, fails.
*  Han, still almost completely blind, fires at a tentacle engaged in close combat with his friend Lando, succeeds!
*  Han accidentally kills Boba Fett
*  Han tries to sneak up on a pair of stormtroopers on Endor, fails.
*  Han tries to warn Chewie about the net trap in the forest, fails.
*  Han tries to hotwire the door controls to the shield generator base, critically fails, activating yet more doors.

And here are the counter-examples, where Han succeeded on a relatively straightforward roll:

[IV] Han, Luke and Chewie successfully get the jump on the imperials in the prison block

[IV] Han is able to destroy the TIE fighters pursuing them

[VI] Han impersonates an imperial At-ST walker pilot to gain access to Endor base

---

I don't know how you would build a system to intentionally re-create a character like Han Solo who seems to fail at nearly all the small stuff but manages to bank karma for the big important moments, but it seems to me that his constant failure is a big part of his charm and failing forward is so baked in to storytelling that we don't bat an eye when we see it.

wp2tim,Does it bother you how D&D parties are essentially Monster Squads now?,"This might stink worse for me because I'd rather have Sword and Sorcery/Pulp Fantasy over High Fantasy any day, but I'm genuinely surprised at how most settings (Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk etc) are intended to be humanocentric but people hardly ever play humans. 

Always thought that this was detrimental to the notion of the fantastical. Elves for instance are supposed to be an arrogant fey-people, older than time itself. But the moment you allow your weeaboo friend to play one that mystique is just flushed down the toilet. 

The conclusion I've arrived at is: if everything is fantastic nothing is. 

Lately I've been really reticent on allowing players to play anything other than humans but they always complain that humans are ""boring"". I've found that games that treat race-as-class like B/X and tables for randomly generating your ancestry like Forbidden Lands achieve a nice mix of preserving a majority of humans while still allowing for other races to be present.

However when they do get the opportunity to play one of these races they never really engage with the different cultural and psychological aspects of being an immortal fey/lycanthrope/winged bird person/whatever. They just gravitate towards having dark vision and a couple other racial powers. So what's the point of it in the end?

ffw1w0,Super proud dad right now,"Yesterday I ran a very short Dungeon World adventure for my six year old son. (My wife too, but mainly she was there to be another player for our son to interact with.) I figured that while the rules would be a bit hard for the boy, Dungeon World's feature of asking the players to fill in details would work well for him.

I couldn't have asked for a better result.

Upon discovering that he could be a healer who could help people, he immediately chose to be a cleric. He wanted to be ""good and kind, and also wear blue and green clothes.""

I started them in the woods at night, (and put appropriate ambiance sounds on a speaker.) They were watching goblins around a camp fire.

Me ""Why are you here? Are you here to rescue someone, or maybe the goblins stole something?""

My kid ""They stole something!""

Me ""What did they steal?""

My kid ""Treasure!!!""

Me ""Who did they steal it from?""

My kid ""ummmmm.... Elves!""

And so began an adventure to get a chest of treasure that the goblins had stolen from the King of the Elves. He loved using his imagination to answer my questions about the story, and I was very interested to discover that he wanted to get the treasure back without actually fighting the goblins. As a human cleric he got a wizard spell and he chose invisibility.

He hid behind our table and whispered to my wife how he wanted to make her invisible to go in and take the chest back. Apparently he was afraid the goblins would hear and see him, so he was being extra careful about hiding. Nothing turned out quite the way he had hoped and he ended up using his fear spell to frighten the goblins one by one. First convincing one that the chest was alive and going to eat him. Then convincing one that his spear was a snake. And lastly making one think his spear was a banana. (It was decided that the last goblin was afraid of healthy food.) There was one more goblin at left at that point, and my wife frightened it away with some fire effects.

10/10 Will run more rpgs with my kid. You should too, they'll surprise you and the smile that they have after the adventure is done will warm your heart. He's already talking about what he happens in the next adventure.

Most of my friends are men and some play rpg's. I'm just salty because a few bad apples make me scared of the clubs and groups and I don't know how to manage it and I have anxiety now when they ask me personal questions or I get attention cause I've been harrassed when turning people down.  
It doesn't matter if it was the first day or months in, I've been asked out in every group I joined the last 10 years and the game dissolved after :(. 


aaaaaaaaaaaa end of formatting reddit on phone is hard
aaaaaaaaaaaa Original Post:. 


Well maybe this a dumb question that I might delete in shame later if the wolves rip me, but here I go. I really want some advice. 
TLDR at the end because there's lots of context and rant here, sorry.

I'm not new to play. I discovered rpgs in uni and joined the club. Played every week and most weekends. Went to some larps, got into cosplay, the whole nine yards. 

People would hit on me but I had a mean girl façade and I'd brush them off. I had a lot of social anxiety but played it cool and it worked? I don't really get social cues and at the time didn't cared to.  


So, uni ended and people went away. I've tried to join some groups in these years (like 7?) but I'm always hitted on. The last 3 groups I joined I clearly explained that I left my last group because the hitting on made me uncomfortable and that I just wanted to play, nothing else. I hate to explain my personal life to strangers but I was trying to assert some boundaries or if I don't then I'm just scared all the time.  

Small Example/Rant: Last group, it was mostly online (bc The Plague) but in the same city. I explain what I am looking for before joining. The DM is new in my city, so I offer to show him around a bit. So we meet in person. The third time meeting, he asks if I am interested in him romantically even if I had asserted that I wasn't interested in dating (he said that) bc I'm nice and we talked for hours (mostly about DnD bc I'm not familiar with 5e). So he thought maybe I liked him and he wanted to shot his shot. Well I was irked but wanting to move on but then I discover that he also put a huge rack on my dragonborn icon (which I never said was female but he assumed). I thought the spot was shining on my character a bit too much the last session and I was so uncomfortable. So I only played one more session before leaving the group (unrelated health reasons).

The group I had before I started giving TMI about my boundaries on the session 0: it was games in a public place and on the second session a player ""caressed"" my knee and another proposed me on a date and I never came back.

Third rant: I've tried to decline when hitted on and move along (all for DnD!) but some ""friends"" threw a fit months later when I started dating someone that wasnt them. Because they accepted my rejection but thought that when I would date again I will chose them as they were ""first in line waiting"". Wtf I am a sandwich in a cafe?  

Am I a coward? Is this my life forever? My male friends have told me that I'm nice and I like to listen/talk so boys are always gonna try, and if I meet them alone they are always gonna think is romantic. But I just prefer to meet people one on one because I'm an introvert. 

I understand people might want to flirt sometimes, but I'm just tired. Of being flirted on, of being touched, of being ignored when I explain I'm not interested. And paranoid. I try to never be alone with a player, sit far away, wear my ugliest baggiest clothes. I'm only playing online even if I have problems with auditory processing so I can't really talk and don't immerse so much. I get uncomfortable when players are nice in case they are flirting but it is always later when I'm relaxed and consider them new friends that the Romantical Discourse  happens.

Any advice? I really miss playing in a table with people. I misss the cliché clickclak of dice. I DMd Paranoia for some friends last week and I had so much fun and I really miss this part of my life.

TLDR: But I don't want to stop being nice. I don't want to have to have all my alerts up it is too tiring. 
Would start session 0 with ""If anyone hits on me I will leave"" instead of ""I left my others groups because people hit on me please don't do that"" work better? Shall I be a bitch? Just endure the flirting and shut it down each time? I don't even know when people are flirting with me but I get cold sweats now if people ask if I have a boyfriend.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28eb6f6b0>,rpg,1662521566.0

Functionally, that's all they do right? In 5e or pathfinder for instance, when a caster picks a specific spell, they're really giving  themselves the option to use  that ability x number of times per day right? Like, instead of giving yourself x amount of rage as a barbarian, you effectively get to build your class from the ground up, and  that feels freeing, for sure, but also a little daunting for newbies, as has been often lamented. All of  this to ask, how should I approach implementing casters from a design perspective?

tk8tub,"Make your character complex, realistic, and three dimensional, simply by writing down two things that they want (the ""Game of Thrones"" method of character creation)","Hey friends, I just wanted to share what I find to be a really quick, easy, and effective way to create really complex-seeming characters, without the need for detailed backstories or extensive planning between sessions.

I’m going to use ASOIAF (Game of Thrones) characters as an example here, because GRRM essentially used these principals when creating his characters. And in doing so, he threw dozens of believable, understandable, and complex characters at his audience all at once, in a way that even casual readers found engaging.

So, what do you do? Simple really:

**Just pick two things for your character to want.**

That's basically it. Any two things. Justify it with a backstory if you want, but it's not necessary. And these don't have to be specific things; in fact, it's best if at least one or both of them are general.

* Ned (1) wants to preserve law and honor, and (2) will do anything to protect children from suffering
* Dany (1) wants to maximize her personal freedom, and (2) free others from whatever is controlling their lives
* Jamie (1) wants to protect his romantic relationship from anything that threatens it, and (2) find someone who truly understands him

The benefit of this is simple. Whenever your character is in a situation, just ask yourself: what can my character do to advance either, or both, of their goals? What can Ned do in this situation to be an honourable person? What can Ned do in this situation that would protect children from suffering?

I think it's clear now why ""more general"" = ""easier"". Ned’s desires could apply to almost any situation, whereas Jamie’s desires are going to come up more situationally (or, at least, you need to do some extra legwork to make it apply; for example Jamie’s “find someone who understands me” often turns to “I hate anyone who doesn’t understand me”)

You also might notice that your character doesn't have to be conscious of these goals. Subconscious drivers work just as well as conscious ones; sometimes even better. Jamie didn't really know he was looking for someone to understand him, until he found one.

So that helps you on the day-to-day running of your character. But what about those big moments of drama?

**Easy Drama: Simply Shake-N-Bake**  

In order to create moments of high-tension and inner conflict, all you have to do is find your character in a situation where their two wants becomes mutually exclusive.

* Children will die unless Ned does something dishonourable & illegal. Is upholding his principles worth the death of an innocent child?
* The people Dany freed are now using their freedom to oppose her. Will she compromise her personal values to ensure their freedom, or do they now become her enemies in her fight to free herself?

And, again... that's it. That choice, and how your character reacts to it, can easily be a defining & memorable moment of your campaign (or, perhaps, an arc of the campaign).

I'd recommend sharing your two goals with your DM, so they can help engineer these situations for you. Heck, share it with your fellow PCs too, why not? Why keep your character a secret, only to be enjoyed by yourself?

**Character Growth**

What if you want to take it a step further? You want your character to have defined growth throughout their story. Well, that's easy too... just have one of those wants change, as a reaction to something that happens in your campaign.

This could easily be as the result of the dramatic moments I laid out above. For example, Dany decides that the only way she can be truly free is force her will on others. She will no longer care about freeing others, only bringing them under her rule.

However, it doesn't have to be. Something else could happen to make your character re-examine their core desires. What if Ned realized that the laws & honour he upholds so dearly were created by a ruler, a God, or system that is, itself, dishonourable? What if he decided that upholding ""law & honour"" are no longer desirable aims? He could easily abandon this want, for reasons that have nothing to do with protecting children.

In these cases, you basically have two options:

* Replace one of the core desires with a new desire
* Remove one of the core desires, leaving your character to become hyper-focused on the other desire

The first option can be immediate. Our (now-hypothetical) Ned has realized that his laws were created by an unjust King/God/System, and so now instead of “I must follow the law”, his new goal is still “I must tear down the law”. However his other goal, “I must protect children”, remains unchanged.

The second option may lead your character on a downward spiral. A character who only wants one thing can be obsessive and unyielding, because there is nothing to temper or balance their desire. They are now single minded.

This could spell the end of your character. Having decided her personal freedom is paramount, Dany goes on a conquest, trying to bring everyone under her rule, until she is eventually killed.

However, it could also just mean a period of wandering and discovery. Maybe after a few sessions, Dany hears legends of her ancestors. Now she has a new goal “find and preserve the history of my ancestors”, which did not come up as a direct consequence of losing one of her old goals, but still fills that missing hole in her life.

This last section is the most difficult to give specific examples for, because it comes down to reacting. You have to decide that something your character experienced was drastic enough, traumatic enough, or victorious enough, for them to abandon their goals (or consider them permanently accomplished) and move on.

**Why not Three Desires?**

Two is not a hard-and-fast rule. Three desires can work. However, keep in mind that the more desires you have, the more muddled they will become, and the less dramatic it will be when your desires come into conflict with each other. If you have eight ""core desires"", they are going to be coming into conflict with each other every day.

These are also ""core desires"". Your character can have other goals, especially the ""party's goals"". Save the village. Find the treasure. Slay the dragon. However, your personal core desires will shape how you go about achieving the ""party's goals"". Ned wouldn't kill a child to save the village, but Dany or Jamie might.

Finally, keep in mind that you are one of several ""main characters"" in the story. Don't be afraid to let your fellow player's characters have turns in the spotlight. If your character has a limited number of clear ""core desires"", they may not shine through in every situation. But when they do shine through, everyone at your table is going to understand how meaningful the choices you are making are for your character.

**Conclusion**

The key to good roleplaying is not “doing a voice” or “always speaking in character”. Those things can make your roleplaying experience entertaining, but they aren’t necessary for good roleplaying.

What is necessary for good roleplaying is knowing “how would my character act?” Is your character brave in combat, or not? Are they the face of the party, or not? Do they trust strangers who give them quests in taverns, or not?

Sometimes players will bend themselves into pretzels writing 10-page backstories for their characters, laying out epic quests their characters will go on... but still not know anything about who their character is as a person. You just end up playing as yourself on that quest (which is fine, if that’s what you want to do).  
 

On the other hand, if you are able to tell yourself “my character wants X”, it becomes really easy to create a consistent, realistic character, without any further planning. Because all you have to do from there is react to the situations your character is put into, through the lens of your character’s desires.

Choosing two things your character wants will go one step further in making your character three dimensional, and giving you some ready-made inner conflict when you reach a point where those two things become mutually exclusive.

And all you need to do to have good “character development” is transition your characters wants into new wants. Again, no planning needed. Just act and react to the story you and your group are telling.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28eda9850>,rpg,1647971727.0
xf4qjx,Something really special is happening with Cyberpunk (2077/Red/Edgerunners),"Just started a campaign and convinced my friends to play Cyberpunk Red with me. There was some interest after a few of them played the video game recently in it's much improved state. They loved the world building and lore, the main and side stories, and the characters. I started reading the rule book and looking up the lore and began to get lost in this incredibly detailed world. The corporations, the people behind them, the wars, the gangs, all the philosophical implications of cybernetics and transhumanism, capitalism, etc. I was falling in love with this world and began building a campaign.

We created characters together and it was an amazingly fun time. The character creation is phenomenal and really ties the player characters to the immediate world and shapes the events and the campaign. By the end of character creation my players and I could actually envision each others characters in a way that was pretty new to us. We learned how they grew up, what the conditions were like, if they had friends/lovers/enemies and if so what's the deal with them (as the GM this is so fun.) We learned what they did for work and how they are connected to Night City.

Then during the next week as the players all chose their skills and cyberware and gear we all watched the anime Cyberpunk Edgerunners. It is brilliant. The animation is as good as it gets, the music from the game, the story and characters and of course Night City. That was something special and put everyone in a very enthusiastic state. Then we finally got to playing.

I had the characters go to a concert as extra security to escort the pop star after the show. They showed up during the last song and I played a song from the Game/Anime soundtrack. I described how the strobe lights matched the beat of the song and how the lasers made little hearts on everyone in between the regular strobe. The song was so wonderful (I Really Want to Stay at Your House) and this scene just became real for all of us. Like the shared storytelling, theatre of the mind experience we were having was much more real than anything I've played before. Some of us got emotional because of how we were transported to a different world. Their characters were transfixed on the performance and they described how they swayed to the music with the crowd.

The rest of the session was amazing. The combat went really quick and they saved the pop star who did some cool stuff during the fight. The players and their characters are obsessed with her now which is a really fun thing.

I just want to add this. Because of the nature of the Cyberpunk universe, because of how close it is to the real world and the dark future we are all sort of quietly fearing in the back of our minds, and because of the quality of the world building and the game/anime being available to get lost in, we were really able to get transported into the world of the game. We could really see each other in character, and understood our characters deeper and because of their immediate and strong ties to the world, the world itself became real. I haven't felt this kind of enthusiasm for a ttrpg campaign since I convinced my favorite coworkers and friends to play DND 5E with me when it came out.

Anyways to the people at CDPR and R.Talsorian games and the studio Trigger, thank you so much for putting this together and for all your hard work. Also to Mike Pondsmith thank you and your wonderful imagination.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28ede4110>,rpg,1663268162.0

z02n7s,A two-year perspective on a full-time game designer career," About two years ago, I came to this very sub to announce that I had left my job and decided to pursue a career as a TTRPG designer.

Now with 20 games under my belt, some accomplishments and a lot of mistakes, I come back to offer some perspective on this choice. Perhaps it will be useful for those seeking a similar path.

So, for the sake of transparency, let's kick things off by addressing the elephant in the room, which is...

# Money

Under my original post, someone commented that I'd be making more money slinging hot dogs than making indie games.

They were right.

Despite achieving moderate success on some of my titles, I still struggle to make ends meet.

I don't have a precise number (due to the different policies of the platforms I publish on), but my earnings stay around $10k/year, which I believe is officially below the poverty line.

I have a very frugal lifestyle. I don't own stuff, I live in a 320 sq ft (30m²) studio apartment in a place with a low cost of living. Yet, I'd need to double my income to be in a comfortable situation.

It goes without saying, but let's reinforce it: many designers have had way more (and also less, if I'm being fair) success than I did during the same period of time, even doing this part-time, so take that as you will. I can't pinpoint exactly why my results are what they are, but I can go over some....

# Mistakes and limitations

When I first started, I decided to create a patron-like model for my creations, promising one new game (or a related piece of content) every other week. Someone pointed out in the comments that I'd need to be very prolific, and even then, I'd be running the risk of having my releases competing against each other.

They were also right.

I was putting out full-fledged games twice a month, and without an audience to consume them, they just ran over each other. I was having way better success with my games on itch than with the patron-like format. It was actually not on Patreon, but on Buy me a coffee (whose platform I liked better, but might be one of the reasons for its failure), and I amassed an underwhelming amount of 7 supporters for the few months I had it open.

So I announced I was shutting down the membership program and decided to focus on releasing and promoting my games on itch. That was my first good decision in months. Until I ran into a few limitations of the format, which I will enumerate:

1. **I don't have access to Kickstarter.** It surprises me how many people don't know that, but if you are not from a [handful of countries](https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005128594-Who-can-use-Kickstarter), KS does not allow you to create projects on their platform. And that’s a huge limitation; the discoverability of your project drastically decreases if you’re not able to have your games in front of a lot of people that had never heard of you before. There are more accessible KS competitors out there, sure, but they have a tiny fraction of the organic audience KS has. I wrote about the barriers that creators from the Global South face, and that even ended up being a [Dicebreaker article](https://www.dicebreaker.com/companies/kickstarter/news/tabletop-games-global-south-invisible). 
2. **I don’t sell physical books.** See above. Not being from the US/UK (\~80% of my customers), it is nearly impossible to sell physical books. Shipping costs would be prohibitive. Distribution would be chaotic. This also means I’m not in any brick and mortar FLGS, and that I don’t attend cons, don’t shake hands and network with other people in the industry. We’re pretty much on our own. I could try to partner up with publishers and distributors in the US, but…
3. **I run a one-man show.** Some might say that is a self-imposed limitation, and they wouldn’t be wrong. I create, write, revise, layout,  illustrate and publish all my games, and *I like it that way* and that’s where I want to spend my energy on*.*  One of the reasons I left my job was to be able to have control over my hours, my intentions and my creations, so all the minutiae that go with contracts, partnerships, commissions, counting on other people’s work just bring me too much anxiety. I turned 40 years old last week, and I’ve learned the hard way to recognize my boundaries and preferences, and I’m not ready to give up on that just yet. Which brings me to…
4. **My games are very niche.** I don’t mean it in a highbrow, no-one-understands-my-art sort of way. No, it’s just a recognition that I don’t produce content for the Dragon Game or for its many clones and variants, which alienates 85% of the market. I like to make my own quirky games, which also means I don’t normally do freelance work for other people’s games. *(side note: I think it says a lot about the industry that one can make more money writing/editing/illustrating for other people’s games than by making their own. Creators inject more money in their games than they get out of them).* I know there’s an audience for all kinds of weird stuff, but how does one get their games in front of them? That leads us to…

# Marketing

When I first started, I thought promoting my creations would be half of my job.

I was wrong. It is 90% of my job.

There are 3,000 games being released every year on itch alone, and it doesn’t matter how good, innovative, fun, ridiculously gorgeous your product is, if people don’t find out it exists, you won’t sell.

This is the area most indie creators struggle with, because there’s no budget for paid advertisement, and most platforms are very averse to self-promoting. Most of us rely (relied?) on Twitter, since it’s more forgiving in that regard, even though we are constantly self-conscious about being annoying, and spamming BUY MY GAMES, I BEG YOU! all the time. And there’s also the feeling that most people that follow and support you are other indie designers, so there’s this weird sensation we are in a bubble passing the same $5 around. 

I don’t mean it in a strictly negative way; the support and enthusiasm of your peers is an excellent source of motivation, and I met fascinating creators and creations this way. But what you need when you’re selling your game is to get in front of people that you **don’t know.** 

Marketing is exhausting and frustrating. You don’t get to be solely a game designer. You have to be a “content creator” to entertain and engage. You have to hold your releases until you have built enough “hype”. You can’t have a bad day, otherwise the algorithm swallows you and suddenly you are irrelevant. 

This is just my personal experience, I’m sure other people navigate this much better than I do. For my latest release, I created a press kit and mailed it to some news outlets, with moderate success. It still didn’t solve my problem, and the sensation that I’d capped out my reach lingers on. There’s always this nagging feeling that I’m not doing enough, I’m not connecting with the right people, I’m not active on the right Discord server, I should experiment with other platforms, I should go to TikTok, I should walk into the ocean… 

I know this all seem very gloomy, but it’s not all that bad. I’m generally a very positive person, I’m just revisiting my experiences and taking the opportunity to get some stuff off my chest. So to end in a positive note, let’s talk about…

# Fulfillment 

One of the main concerns I had before deciding to become a full-time game designer is that I would “taint” my relationship with RPGs and I would start hating them. *“Work with what you love, and you’ll never love anything again in your life”*, you know? 

I was wrong (see a trend there?).

I love what I do. Waking up and working with games is as rewarding as I thought it could be. I look forward to starting my work day. The ideas keep coming, and I have two dozen games already on the backburner. If I knew what I’d face these two years the day I decided to quit my job, I’d still do it again. Not a doubt.

I’ve been welcomed into the space with warmth and respect, I have released games in more than 7 languages, I’ve won an award, I’ve won a competition, I have an RPG system with more than 60 games made by the community. I’ve been invited to a number of podcasts (some of them I’d been a long time listener), I have been featured in a number of articles. I have been nominated “one of 10 indie designers to keep an eye on” by a respectable media outlet. I have received enormous amounts of positive feedback, and more than one person I met told me that I am their favorite game designer.

There are good days and bad days. There’s not a week that goes by without my considering looking for a job and quitting this unpredictable life. There are days that I lack the energy to even look at my projects. But I reckon such is the life of anyone that decides to work with creativity. And I can't help but think it is, still, a very rewarding one.

A few months ago, I shared my thoughts on the subject on Twitter and announced I was going to give this career a final go. I started a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/capacle), and this time, with the lessons learned from my previous failure, I simplified it a lot. The response was… overwhelmingly positive. I now fluctuate around 90 patron any given month, and although I’m far from my goal, it is encouraging to feel the support of so many people that believe in what you do.

I gave myself until the end of this year to sort things out. If I’m unable to make this career a sustainable one, it will be time for me to find something else. Or a new strategy, who knows.

# Takeaways

If you made it this far through my rambling and grumbling, and is considering pursuing a career in game design, I’d say (maybe surprisingly), go for it.

My father died of cancer when he was 60, not accomplishing many of his plans that he left for his retirement that never came.

Ultimately, I decided to try it because I didn’t want to be in my death bed, considering “What if I had pursued my passion”. If it all goes wrong, at least I tried. And had fun while doing it. No regrets. 

Be prepared for some hardship, but stay true to who you are. Don’t try and make the game that you think you sell most; make the ones you believe in, the ones that you are excited about. If you think there’s enough games out there, you’re wrong. Every honest game that is published reflects a vision that is unique, it is a slice of a perspective over this incomparable experience that a roleplaying game is. 

Create a good network from the get-go, and always be kind. You might reach more people if you are controversial, but why would you?

And remember (as I always try to do) that nothing is permanent. If it doesn’t work, that is ok. Move on. Try something else. No one is keeping score, you don’t own anyone explanations. 

I’ll be more than happy to answer any questions you might have (from my very limited, very unique perspective), so go ahead and AMA, I guess?

ovtf2n,I now understand why people want modules,"So I ran a quick 1 hour session for my 5 and 8 year old nephews yesterday, and they came ALIVE like nothing else. Especially the 8 year old - he said he has never had so much fun playing a game, so I gave him the sheet I was running the game off of (a simple one page RPG) and some dice, and as I was telling him he could GM for his brother/friends he turns to me and says:

“I’ll probably just run the story you did, I don’t really know what is going on in the world! Maybe you can write some stories that I can do?”

Wow! That took me back - I’ve been a consistent GM almost every week for 7 years in highly improvisational ttrpgs (mostly pbta) so modules were never really my thing, but it now all makes sense to me!!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x290093620>,rpg,1627829229.0

You can use these All Dice Tables as written or have them influence your characters to give them or their plan more depth. 

* ***One Thing Led to Another…*** generates an origin for your villain base on seemingly mundane events that continue to escalate until they become the villain they are today.
* ***A Step-By-Step Guide to the Villain’s Multipoint Plan*** is exactly what it sounds like. It generates a step-by-step outline of the major points of their evil scheme.
* ***The Unexpected Banes and Boons They Experienced for Their Plan*** keeps their plan from getting stale or going too well by introducing unexpected benefits and penalties that force them to alter their plan.

I like a level of unpredictability as a GM, even in the plans I make for NPCs and villains. So I hope those who also enjoy that as well can get some good ideas out of these tables. u/DougTheDragonborn and I figured this was a great way to share these ideas.

The movie really feels like something your beer and pretzels party was up to in their last year's campaign, including many many super clever plans that horribly fail.

What is most important the film does not at any moment tries to change any D&D trope to make it ""more appealing to wide audience"" , its true to D&D to a fault of being even not understood by wide audience. Almost nothing is changed ""for cinematic effect"" and even things that are, are in range of DM homebrew rule.

l6t9zy,An incredibly good actual play that isn't getting NEARLY enough attention.,"Hi guys,

I've recently started watching an actual play series on YouTube called ""Me, Myself and Die"". It's hosted by Trevor Devall  (voice of Rocket Raccoon \[Guardians of the Galaxy animated series\], Emperor Palpatine \[Lego Star Wars\], various characters from F is for Family and a whole load of anime stuff).

What makes it different from other actual plays is, first of all; Trevor is an excellent voice actor and uses music, multiple camera angles and improv talents to bring his stories to life. The production values are top notch. And secondly, he plays no-GM RPGs - which I think is a very interesting sub-genre of TTRPGs that is yet to be fully explored. In the latest season, he is playing Ironsworn, which I know a few of you around here are familiar with. In my opinion, it is the best GMless system around at the moment and Trevor really captures the tone and setting of the Ironlands perfectly.

What is a *real* travesty is the fact that he only has around 5k subscribers at the time of writing. I think the only problem with the channel is a lack of exposure. Anyone who has watched this series will agree this could be (will be?) a huge success. So please, for your own sake if nothing else, go check it out!

Below is a link to the first episode of the 2nd season. You don't need to have watched the first season to get into it (but by all means, go back and watch it) . I think he really found his stride in the current season. Plus, it's the first season that he's playing Ironsworn which is a very good system and setting for what he's doing.

Enjoy!

cyq2ny,The time I let my character of nearly 1300 playing hours die for the story.,"The best characters are the ones we love, but play true to the story and character we've created. Sometimes a character's personality and justified actions leads them to death's door... And, while it's sad, it's only proper that they ended up there because it was the ending they deserved. 

I will tell my story of such a character, I would love to hear yours.

Years back in my D&D 3.5 days, when it was still a new system, I played in a campaign for 2 years. Average 12 hour sessions, every Saturday, never once missed a game in the entire campaign run. Started at level one, my character died at level 16 and it was a houseruled slow experience progression. It was a strict one life campaign... no resurrections outside of what can strictly be achieved in direct gameplay.

I played Anthony Marcs, a fighter for hire, soldier in the King's Army, and eventually Knight of the Crown. He was known as the One Man Army. A Mountain of a man standing just shy of 7 feet of rippling muscle (who eventually discovered that there was giant blood in his lineage) He fought with great sword and tower shield. 

His story started humbly enough, he was a young man who was just too large not to use his fighting prowess for coin. He mostly worked as a caravan guard or tavern bouncer. When the kingdom went to war, he joined up immediately for the king's coin. But it was never the coin that drove Anthony, that was only a means to fund digging into his family's past. However, he always fought with honor and for his comrades in arms more than anything. 

His journey took him through a war, which the kingdom eventually won. He was swiftly promoted to a battalion captain in the early days. But it was when he saved the general from an ambush that his superiors really took notice. It wasn't long after he was knighted for many brave actions. 

It was then that he became known as the One Man Army. Leading his battalion into the worst of the front lines. Wading into a torrent of death and torment and laying waste to his enemies in large swaths. (I think it was a feat, Improved Great Cleave or something like it that allowed for a 5-foot step to continue cleaving... sooooo broken and exploitable and **boy** did I exploit it.)

During leave from the war, and after the war, he had set out to dig up information about his family's mysterious past. Discovered hereditary magic armor, sword, and shield. Found out his great grandfather was a great knight as well. 

After the War his king sent him on quests for the crown. One such quest was to escort an ambassador to the dwarven nation (they haaated humans). On this mission he managed to befriend the dwarf assigned to work with his party. They liked that he could drink like them and fight like them. 

His final battle came on that mission. As part of the peace treaty the party agreed to help the dwarves with a beast in the depths of their city. Some sort of giant earth lovecraftian plant horror. Whipping tentacles with 60ft reach. The battle was grim, and the party far outmatched. Eventually the Wizard was down, the Cleric out of juice, and most of the combatants impotently forced to stay out of reach of the monster. 

The moment of truth came. Anthony's sword was within the killing field, dropped when saving the wizard from true death. The next in line to be attacked was a Dwarf Warrior (NPC). They had fought side by side on a few quests. He was gruff and unlikeable. But he was down and imobile... Anthony himself wasn't far from death's door...

In a brave action he sprinted into the killing field, managed to grab up his sword on the run (dex check) and make it to the Dwarf Warrior. (First round) He hoisted the unconscious dwarf to his shoulders, both wearing plate mail. 

He ran. 

Mear feet from safety the Monster took notice and attacked. Anthony saw the whipping vine coming, and in desperation he tossed the dwarf (heh) to safety... and took the killing blow that cut him in half. 

The battle was won only very nearly. The Dwarf Warrior survived. They honored Anthony's sacrifice with a monument on the battlegrounds of his death. His loss forged a strong alliance between the nations. 

-----

My DM came to me after the session and asked me if I wanted to bring Anthony back. The battle was so epic, and it was a character I had ran for yeeears. I was the ONLY character that had survived from level 1. But... I couldn't allow it. Sure I loved the character. I was sad to lose him... But, how could I deny such him such an honorable and epic death?

htyysg,Best innocent phrases to terrorize your PCs,"I am a benevolent GM. I totally dislike to kill PCs unless they are ok with it for dramatic reasons. However, I have a ridiculous amount of fun making them feel fear with menial things.

Couple of my favorites:

""Ok, so, who's the one that will enter first? (All time favorite. I ask this question every time and it works every time).

""Not so fast"" (when they want to skip time traveling from. One place to another)

""By the way"" (just after a supposedly happy ending).

This is an RPG that's only played with Magic cards. You use them to create your character, and you use them instead of dice. They also make up all the spells, items, locales, and NPCs. There's a guide for turning any card into something useful for the RPG, though obviously it will take some creative work from a GM, especially for complex cards. But that's my favorite part of the game so far, tbh.

hi1px2,First 'RPG' session with my 2-year-old daughter,"I want to share what just happened because it warmed my heart. 

My 2-yo daughter, The Kid, was listening in on a conversation between mum and dad on sketching things on the fly during an RPG session, and The Kid was looking at the art. She started recognizing stuff in the rough sketch, so I wanted to see if this could work. I showed her a path that went in two directions and asked her which way she wanted to go. She had a clear opinion on where to go, so the adventure took off!

I flipped the page over, and quickly sketched the path leading to a dark cave, describing everything as I draw it, in words that she knows. There's something next to the cave. ""Do you go in, or check out the other thing?"" The Kid checks out the other thing, which turns out to be a very friendly bear next to a lake! 

I show her the lake and the bear. The Kid starts to whisper. ""...bear...."", and I ask her if she wants to go for a swim or play with the bear. The Kid wants to swim. Splash! I draw a big water splash and The Kid wants the bear to jump in too. Splash! The page is covered in big water explosions. The Kid is excited, shouting to her mum to come and see. 

""Ok, the bear feels wet and goes inside."" I draw pawprints leading into the cave. The Kid wants to follow. Inside, she finds the bear, eyes closed, The Kid's mum makes snoring sounds. ""Do you want to take a nap with your bear friend or go home?"" The Kid goes home. I slowly move the picture back, making it smaller and smaller as we wave and say ""bye bear!""

I tell The Kid that she is now back home. I hug her and ask her what she did. She says it was a bit scary, but quickly begins to talk about bear, splash, making snoring sounds, and other stuff that happened on her adventure.

113p938,Safety tools: why has an optional rule caused such backlash among gamers?,"Following on various recent posts about safety tools, I find the amount of backlash remarkable and, on the surface, nonsensical. That half-page, sidebar-length suggestion has become such a divisive issue. And this despite the fact that safety tools are the equivalent of an optional rule. No designer is trying to, or can, force safety tools at your table. No game system that I know of hinges mechanically on you using them. And if you ever did want to play at a table that insisted on having them, you can always find another. Although I've never read actual accounts of safety tools ruining people's fun. Arguments against them always seem to take abstract or hypothetical forms, made by people who haven't ever had them at their table.

Which is completely fine. I mainly run horror RPGs these days. A few years back I ran *Apocalypse World* with sex moves and Battle Babes relishing the thrill of throwing off their clothes in combat. We've never had recourse to use safety tools, and it's worked out fine for us. But why would I have an issue about other people using it at their tables? Why would I want to impinge on what they consider important in facilitating their fun? And why would I take it as a person offence to how I like to run things?

I suspect (and here I guess I throw my hat into the divisive circle) the answer has something to do with fear and paranoia, a conservative reaction by some people who feel threatened by what they perceive as a changing climate in the hobby. Consider: in a comment to a recent post one person even equated safety tools with censorship, ranting about how they refused to be censored at their table. Brah, no Internet stranger is arriving at your gaming night and forcing you to do anything you don't want to do. But there seems to be this perception that strangers in subreddits you'll never meet, maybe even game designers, want to control they way you're having fun.

Perhaps I'd have more sympathy for this position if stories of safety tools ruining sessions were a thing. But the reality is there are so many *other* ways a session can be ruined, both by players and game designers. I don't foresee safety tools joining their ranks anytime soon.

9tg78t,GM Advice: Learn from Kids TV Shows,"Last night while watching PJ Masks with my 4 year old I thought of a theory I'd like to share. I think that most GMs could learn a great deal from writing adventures like kids TV shows. It's a working theory, but it has three parts to it.

1) The stakes are clear and important, but not life or death.

The PJ Masks, Mystery Inc or My Little Ponies are not going to get violently dismembered on screen. That is not the crux of the drama or action. Death is not the penalty for them failing. The stakes of the conflict are so clear that even 3yr olds understand them. If the heroes fail, then X happens. X does not involve death generally. 

From an RPG perspective, this solves two major problems. Firstly, it lets the heroes lose. Losing adds drama and adds consequence to their actions or failures. Too often RPGs are a game of playing through how the PCs win, not IF they win. A villain succeeding in a plan, the heroes being defeated and the terrible X happening are great ways to move the story forward.

The second pro of this is that failure does not disrupt the story via death. A failure adds to the story, generally death detracts from it. Also, if death is the only consequence, players tend to think their characters have plot armour and cannot fail. That is largely a gaming group dependant issue though.

Lastly it makes the GM think about more interesting options for the villains plans and encounters. Something as simple as an encounter with 6 orcs can be made better by just considering what else other than life and death could be at stake. What are the orcs doing? Destroying a damn that will flood the smurf village? Summoning something? Raiding a caravan of nuns? Playing hide and seek? (I actually used that last one in a very funny encounter with 4 ogres and an under-levelled party)

2) Action does not equal violence.

Heroes in kids shows are often using their weapons and abilities to fix problems in action sequences that are not all about violence. I have become a big fan of running in-initiative action sequences that are not all about combat. 

Most recently we had a ship in a storm being called onto rocks by sirens with sharks in the water. The action was about cutting ropes that were tangled, steering the ship, wrestling the helmsmen away as he tries to steer into the rocks, saving sailors who jumped overboard and are swimming to the sirens, putting out fires from badly stowed lanterns etc. Attacking the sirens without dealing with the other issues would have been disastrous.

My second example was in a Star Wars game, they come out of warp suddenly to find an asteroid field. Now we effectively have a combat scene, trying to use missiles to blast asteroids that the pilot cannot avoid. Doing repairs on the ships. Saving people trapped in depressurised areas of the ship. The droid going into space to fix the hull. The slicer trying to boost the computer so it can navigate a warp jump the second they are clear of debris, the caged Nexu they just captured getting free in the cargo hold (which happens to hold the kit they need to repair the ship).

My games have become a lot more action intensive since adopting this style of encounter design. Roughly a third of my action scenes are fairly straight fights. A third are chases or action scenes where there is a fight, but the object is not to kill the baddies e.g. stop the bad guys taking off in the ship, plant these bombs then run, stop the ritual summoning. The last third of encounters are just disasters, things going wrong that require action scenes to fix e.g. Saving orphans from a burning building, shipwrecks, turn on the space stations thrusters and inertial dampeners as it hurtles towards the planet etc.


3) Look at a kid watching Scooby Doo. They feel so clever for working out that Old Man Whithers was really behind it. We don't look at kids and tell them that is stupidly easy and it is bad wrong fun. The point of Scooby Doo is to make the kids feel clever for working out the mystery, not to show off how clever the writer is. Sure the plot could have been more convoluted and clever, Agatha Christie could write a very different Scooby Doo, but would anybody enjoy it more?
The point of a mystery is to not to be clever. It is to make the players think that they were clever for working it out. I save myself a lot of time and effort by remembering this. A rule of thumb for my players is, I set mysteries as one step harder than 'patronising' 

--

None of this is news to veteran GMs, but I found by tying these reflections to kids TV shows, it helps me remember them when designing games. I hope that this is of some use as a reminder to veterans or some helpful ideas to newbies. What do you think? Have you found any rules of thumb that you feel make you a better GM?

He talks about introducing an epic villain that his party swiftly dispatches a session later. He says that it was ""narratively unsatisfying"" but his PCs loved it. I think that's something that I personally enjoy about D&D -- the fact that on a fundamental level, D&D's mechanics don't center narrative structure or payoffs. I know that a lot of people are frustrated by moments where the game subverts their narrative expectations (e.g. when a player says something badass and then rolls a 1 on their attack or skill roll) but I think I love that aspect of the game, because it leads to outcomes that I often would not have entertained if I were aiming for some specific plot outcome. I like the vein of goofy antics it enables in even the most serious games, and I like how it mirrors life, which is so often untidy and will mingle the risible with the dramatic.

v5gzsb,"Playing D&D In Ukraine: It's Been 100 Days (and 8 Years), Innit","Hi there.

So, after several weeks of depression, nervous breakdowns, supporting the military, avoiding social contacts and other fun things, I went back to meeting with out local gaming group.

It felt different in many ways.

Last time, the air raid alert meant that we dropped the game, gathered our stuff and moved to the shelter. Today, it was more like:

""Oh, another alert? When did the previous one end?""

""Y'know, these days, I'm only hiding when I hear the bangs"".

""When I hear the bangs, I know that these are the ones that didn't hit me"".

""True"".

Our region used to be significantly russian-speaking, and so were our games. It just doesn't feel nice to speak and hear that language anymore. Today we played in Ukrainian.

Last time, everyone was monitoring the news all the time. Not today. We're used to what's happening, we pretty much know how things go, we're not expecting anything big to suddenly change everything. This is war, it's part of our lives, it's not going away anytime soon.

Which, by the way, means we spent more time actually concentrating on the game.

As usually, we started with deciding who's gonna be the GM today.

""So who's doing it?""

""He is!""

""HE is!""

""Nuh uh, I haven't got any books with me! I haven't prepared anything! I haven't been preparing anything for weeks!""

""Here, you can sit in the nice chair if you're the GM"".

""Hmm. It is a very nice chair, indeed"".

""You're the GM"".

""Ugh, fine. We can do the Immortal  Zoo again"".

""Yeah, Zoo is fun!""

Luckily, I can GM a party through the Immortal Zoo of Ping Feng with my eyes closed.

This party consisted of an undead elf mage, a fairy barbarian with hysteric deafness, a dwarf, a talking beaver, and a Vornheim goblin (the elf's and the barbarian's players have played through the Immortal Zoo before, cudos for staying in character and not metagaming too much, other than roaring with laughter occasionally).

""Where do we meet? Are we in cages?""

""Are we on a slaveship?""

""No, no. Nothing so boring. You meet in a tavern"".

""A tavern, huh?""

""Each one of you got a letter from the Archbishop of Vorn, inviting you here. As you enter the tavern, you notice several people sitting and drinking. They watch you silently. It is completely quiet"".

I don't remember who gave the advice about the completely silent tavern in this subreddit, but I want to thank that person, because it worked well.

Fast forward to the Archbishop arriving, the barbarian drinking beer out of a large bucket with an umbrella in it, and the dwarf feasting on smoked ~~beav~~ otter meat.

""I point at the Archbishop and say ""He pays for our orders!""

""As the bartender looks at the Archbishop, he turns pale, then green, then mutters ""It is on the house"".

""I look at the Archbishop with admiration - this is the man who pays for everything while not paying for anything!""

The Archbishop asks them to bring something out of the Immortal Zoo...

""Do I know anything about this place?""

""As a matter of fact, yes. Your beaver great-grandfather Hugo is rumoured to have been specially picked for the Zoo"".

Yes, something out of the Immortal Zoo - an instruction for making a spell that grants the inhabitants of the Zoo immortality (they can be killed, but never die of hunger or old age, as long as they stay in the Zoo).

So to the Zoo they went. It was a fun and silly adventure, with some situations like...

""Wait, I have a mummufied lizard that can answer one question daily. I ask it how do we defeat this giant snake?""

""You don't. Thank you for asking the mummified lizard"". (The snake was an illusion, and the lizard always answers truthfully but is kind of an asshole)

""The vampire monkey jumps on the goblin from the ceiling, and tries to bite it"".

""On the neck?""

""Umm... the monkey pauses, and hisses ""But where isss the neck on thisss one?""

""I bite the monkey"".

""Roll for it... hmm. You bite the vampire monkey. It shrieks, writhing wildly, as it transforms into a goblin"". (The newly formed goblin briefly joined the party, got pierced with several bits of metal when a cage exploded nearby, and died in a swimming pool surrounded by young women from the noblest family of Vornheim).

Then there was the large egg that the dwarf tried to hatch.

""The eggshell cracks. The cracks widen... and, as the egg falls apart, you see inside it four smaller eggs"".

""Huh. Do we hatch these ones, too?""

""Let's eat them now!""

And that was even before the beaver found the heavily drugged tea.

We agreed to meet next week. I guess I'll be sitting in the nice chair again.

But next time, I'll bring the books, the maps, and the paper minis.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x291d76de0>,rpg,1654446659.0

I picked a town and everyone pulled up the same spot on the map.  We used it to keep track of where we went, and street level to look for back doors or fire escapes.  If someone found something interesting, they could just screen shot and out it in the Discord chat for the others to see.

The thing is that the majority of games out there have a free version of the game (sometimes called an SRD) that you can try out. They don't always include every option thats in the books, but they have enough in there to run the game and see if its something you actually want to spend a bunch of money on.

It doesn't actually have to be ""space communism."" That's an eye catching headline. The point is that I want something novel.

Assuming captialism exists forever is sooo boring.

Shoutout to Fate's Red Planet where the martians use ""progressive materialism"" which is a humanist offshoot of communism. Also a shoutout to Fragged Empire where their economic system is intentionally abstracted since only one society is captialist and others use things like reputation based economics.

This cake tastes bad, this music sucks, it stinks in here, I’m bored. These criticisms could crush your friend. The party will end, everyone leaves, and your friend will be left alone with the negative thoughts you gave him. Do you think he’ll invite you to his next party? Maybe he won’t even host another party because of your criticism. 

Now the party is over. The host is probably tired from hosting. Hopefully the host is happy that his party went well, even if you don’t think it did. If you want to help your friend host a better party next time, perhaps he’ll be open to constructive criticism. Hang on to that. Wait till tomorrow. Share your ideas once the host is rested and has come down from the excitement. 

In a table-top role-playing game, the game master is hosting a party for his players. As a player in the game, you are a guest at his party. A party requires friends and socializing. A party requires a group but it’s still the host’s party. It is the host’s responsibility to provide a fun time for the guests. It is the guest’s responsibility to appreciate the host, be polite, and get along with the other guests as well as the host. This all usually seems really obvious but sometimes we need a reminder.

te3hv2,"Players want PC death to be an option, but they always get mad when it happens.","Hey there lovely people. Got a conundrum I'm sure many of you have run into before.

I can't tell you how many times I've had players tell me ""Death is important in rpgs. My character has to be mortal, so please don't pull punches or fudge rolls. If I die, I die. I've got a million back up characters and ideas.""

Then their character dies, whether from poor decisions or unlucky rolls, and they get upset. I don't mean ""oh no I'm dead"" upset either (it sucks to lose a character and I'd understand being sad about it), I mean they get aggressively upset. I've had players who refuse to talk to anyone, players who start blaming teammates, even one player who blamed me and said they'd make their next character as broken as they could to ""get back at me."" 

I'm reminded of one dear friend whose level 3 character died to a pack of wolves due to overextending and failing several key roles. He was upset, sulked for about 3 minutes, then jumped into role-playing his character's final moments and got ready to bring in his backup next session. He had always told me he wanted the world to be dangerous, where death was on the line. And when it happened, he responded in a good way. 

So how do you deal with players reacting so badly to character deaths, especially when those players outwardly say they want death to be a possibility? 

(And as a note, I do not like killing PCs. It derails story beats and party cohesion.

Me: Hi community, you are all fans of this game... I have questions about the book...

Community: Oh yeah do not bother, go watch this video of the creator running a session. 

Me: Oh its like that again... I see. 

Reasons why this happens:

1) Books are sold to Story Tellers, but rarely have Story Teller content, pure player content. When it comes to 'how do I run this damn game?' there will be next to zero advice, answers or procedures. For example ""There are 20 different playbooks for players!"" and zero monsters, zero tables, zero advice.  

2) Layout: Your book has everything anyone could want... in a random order, in various fonts, with inconsistent boxes, bolding and italics. It does not even have to be 'art punk' like Mork Borg is usable but I can picture one very 'boring' looking book that is nigh unreadable because of this. 

3) 'Take My Money' pitches... the book has a perfect kickstarter pitch like 'it is The Thing but you teach at a Kindergarden' or 'You run the support line for a Dungeon' and then you open the book and well... it's half there. Maybe it is a lazy PBTA or 5e hack without much adapting, maybe it is all flavor no mechanics, maybe it 100% assumes 'you know what I'm thinking' and does not fill in important blanks. 

4) Emperors New Clothes: This is the only good rpg, the other ones are bad. Why would you mention another RPG? This one has no flaws. Yeah you are pointing out flaws but those are actually the genius bits of this game. Everything is a genius bit. You would know if you sat down with the creator and played at a convention.

&#x200B;

Hey folks, I decided to do another One Million square-feet of battlemaps. This time it’s a forest.

All original content using Photoshop and photos I take with my phone.

Each, individual map in One Million: Forests comes in 2 versions; the base version and the adventurer version (somewhere for DMs to plot their encounters and adventurers). There are 98 (30x30inch) maps in total, 49 for the base set and 49 for the adventurer version. All of the maps are interconnected to map a giant (over) 1 million square feet of forest. 

Please remember, all of my maps, including these (and the gridded versions) are completely free, it’s a way to give back to a hobby that I have enjoyed so much for over 37 years. All I ask is that you don’t sell them, and you credit me wherever possible (if possible).

Some people have been asking if there is an easier way to download these sets, so I have managed to get myself some extra space on Google Drive, zip the map sets into handy folders and put them out there for you to download as full sets. This has cost me a little, so I hope you understand that if you want the sets, you will have to send me a donation on my Ko-Fi page (any size donation will do), and then have access to links for the giant zip files.

You will have access to around 10 million square feet of maps, including:

One Million: The Original (including expansion sets)

One Million: Island (including night versions and expansion sets)

One Million: Deeper Dungeons 

One Million: Dungeon Dimensions (including night versions)

One Million Forest – Base

One Million Forest - Adventurer

Dragon Lair maps

This is a classic example of someone not sticking to the project plan; I ran over my self-imposed deadline and gave myself another hundred or so hours of work, but I think the result may be worth it.

All I ask is that you don’t sell them, and you credit me wherever possible (if possible). 

I do now have a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/zatnikotel) , where you can donate to my ‘keeping my maps free’ cause. Oh, and thank you if you’ve already donated; you are really helping to make these things possible!

I may expand on these maps, if there’s enough interest, so just let me know. 

These maps are designed for use in VTT. This one is 50 x 50 inch, where 1 inch = 5-feet of game play.

I hope you enjoy!

8k4m0p,My five-year-old son advocated Genocide in a GURPS Space game I run with him,"While going for long walks with my five-year-old son, I kept him interested in these walks by doing a (very) simple version of GURPS:Space. He is more interested in Spaceships than he is Fantasy, so it was Space for us.

For our first ""story arc"" he would usually just hunt space pirates in his battleship ""the Mater"" (because he also liked Cars), and he loved finding and engaging with Space Pirates. He was quite good at cleaning out pirate infestations. 

I introduced an extremely simple build mechanic where he can generally build whatever he wants with just ""Metal"", more metal he gathers, the more stuff he can build. Eventually, he starts adding new spaceships to his fleet. He has discovered Star Wars so future spaceships he builds are based around Star Wars ships and such.

Anyway, all this culminated not too long ago with him asking me a simple question, ""Daddy, The Death Star would need too much metal for me to build it, right?""

Intrigued, I responded with, ""Yeah, a Death Star is pretty big, it would take far too long to build and gather resources. Wait, why do you need a Death Star?""

Son: ""I was just thinking, if I had a Death Star, and found a planet full of Pirates... I could just destroy the planet and get rid of the Pirates that way""

Me: ""Perhaps we can think of more peaceful means of pacifying than genocide son""

Son: ""Okay Daddy. I can still build a Star Destroyer, right?""

Me: ""You have gathered a lot of Metal recently. Yeah, let's see what we can do on that front.""

My son's interest in RPGs, and specifically what he now refers to as ""The Spaceship Game"" is something him and I have been playing regularly since the start of this year. Even telling me ""Daddy, I want to play this game forever and ever"", nothing else we have done has captured his imagination like talking through and rolling dice for various space adventures has. I do hope we continue this game for years to come. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29396f800>,rpg,1526566849.0
ew75lx,Anyone else have too many RP books and concepts but not enough players/time?,"Hey!

Okay, so I've been collecting for not a long time, probably like 3-4 years by now, but I've collected a fair amount of books and systems in that time span. 

This in turn has lead to me taking the time to, at the least, skim through most of them, and then do more deeper readings on systems I am more interested in or friends/family is interested in trying it. 



In turn, this has caused a lot of problems from a creative perspective. I will come up with a TON of ideas from all the systems and want to run them all, but then of course can't find people, or just plain don't have the time. And eventually those story ideas fade as well. 


How do others handle this? Is this mostly an issue with people who have many systems? 

Have you created anything like a list of potential campaign ideas per system and saved it with the system itself? Etc etc.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2939c6ba0>,rpg,1580398522.0

Jane is  an event director at a retirement community.  She is in charge of, you guessed it, planning events for the seniors.  She has been successful with everything from bingo to balloon table hockey.  

One day her boss, Sarah, informs her that  their facility has been chosen for a pilot program to help troubled/at risk youth forced to volunteer at the retirement community.  Jane struggles with finding an activity engaging enough for both the seniors and the teens.  She recruits the help of her teenage child, Aaron/Erin, who is an avid RPG'er.  

Aaron/Erin gives DM advise to Jane who runs sessions for the group of seniors and angsty teens. Who reluctantly (at first) form bonds over the course of game play.  

It's a Golden Girls meets, that 70's show, meets Community.

You could replace Jane with John, who is a single dad trying to form a bond with Erin his teenage daughter.

(Re-post for this sub)","I’ve set myself some mapping challenges before, but nothing so epic as this. One million square-foot play area of battlemap. I almost gave up and thought of posting the individual maps that I had finished, but in the end, ‘Destiny still arrives’.

A total of 16 x 50 x 50-inch, all original content, interconnected maps, to create a huge dungeon/cave complex.

[THE LINK](https://www.deviantart.com/zatnikotel/gallery/69186144/The-One-Million)

So, with sore eyes and more than a little nervousness, I present to you ‘The One Million’

Please remember, all of my maps, including these (and the gridded versions) are **completely free** (I don’t do Patreon, marketplace, etc.), it’s way to give back to a hobby that I have enjoyed so much for over 36 years. All I ask is that you don’t sell them, and you credit me wherever possible (if possible).

General breakdown of each area:

A1: River Entrance, A2: Portal, A3: Chasm, A4: Lava Caves

B1: Spider Lair B2: Underground Village, B3: River Crossings, B4: Natural Caves

C1: Swampy Roots, C2: Fungus Infestation, C3: Underground Lake, C4: Mines

D1: Roadway Passage, D2: Burrows, D3: Wizard’s Lair, D4: Tombs

If there is sufficient interest, I may expand on a few of the areas, which may change the base maps as presented here, for example, I have ideas to create a Wizard’s Tower for section D3, in such a case I will change the map here so the others I produce will make more sense. If you have any ideas for expansion or would like to see a specific area explored further, just let me know.

These maps are designed for use in VTT. This one is 50 x 50 inch, where 1 inch = 5-foot of game play.

I hope you enjoy!

v8hgxw,For those who need to hear it - There is a secret to scheduling problems,"I hear all the time, ""Want to play, but we're always in scheduling hell between work, school, life, parenting, spontaneous combustion, etc""

There is a secret to it, though you might not like it. If your group is in scheduling hell, then you are currently prioritizing players over playing. I've seen it before, 5 friends who used to have more time, all want to play RPGs, but you can pull off one session every 9 months. You've prepicked the people at the table, availability be damned. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's the source of scheduling problems.

The reality is to create the time for the game to happen on a regular schedule, put the invite out to your friends, local game store, local library bulletin boards, local town Facebook gab page, everywhere (even more places if you play online). But if you have a fixed time, like every Thursday at 7pm, and invite people who can make it work, I promise you, you'll have a game in no time.

It may not be with your super close friends, but admit that RPGs fall into the same boat as every group activity, sometimes you join a new group, it's not rude to your friends to join a bowling league that none of them have time for. Same thing for RPGs, if you can make time for the game, you can make the game happen, just not with the people you expect it to feature.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x293f41bb0>,rpg,1654783197.0
oc80m2,"I recently ""won"" as a GM","No, not what Dexter from Dexter's Laboratory would consider winning. No players died.  
A bit of background I'm sure is familiar to many: When the pandemic started happening, I offered to run a campaign for five of my friends. 

Since we're all familiar with the setting and lore, (and I had just finished the first Ravenor novel), I decided to run a Dark Heresy campaign, giving me ideas and concepts about how to world build in this grim dark universe.  
I'd also just finished playing through the Yakuza franchise. If you don't know anything about these games, they're heavily story-driven games with amazingly well written and voiced characters, every main game bringing tears to my eyes in one way or another, whether it was intentional laughter or genuine sorrow. It really helped me with bringing to life NPCs that would play an important role in the grand mystery of the campaign. In addition to all that my players were absolutely wonderful. Thinking outside of the box when needing, surprising me with their ideas, and all genuinely developing their character as the game went along. 

Mostly we would try to play every 2 or 3, sometimes 4, weeks, and we played for a little over a year.  


Long story short, by the time the campaign had drawn to a close in a final big dungeon crawl that I'd spent a large amount of time on, the players and myself had a keen understanding and emotional attachment to the world, characters, and acolytes (PCs). After the final battle, twist, and ending ""cinematic"", I used fallout as inspiration to give the players an idea of what happened after they had left. After all, they had impacted not just the NPCs they encountered, but the planet's fate as a whole.  
I had a very hard time keeping my voice even as I read the ""credits"" of the game, which sprinkled in which characters were most affected by which player, and how their outlook or actions changed their lives. I was not alone, right after dropping the hammy final line ""because in the 41st Millennium... there is only war"", a couple of my players admitted to having tears in their eyes, and how some really didn't want the game to end.  


I haven't felt this good about a game I've put together in my entire life, and I am so so happy and humbled that I could make my player's lives a little more interesting and fun.

kf1mt0,Two trans players. One wants to escape gender issues in game and the other wants to actively confront them. Advice on how to handle this?,"The dilemma I have is in the title. One player (A) in a game I run is partly closeted trans and wants games they play in to specifically be their chance *not* to make a big deal of it. Retcon the character and never mention it again basically. They were quite clear that they didn't want to play out the headaches they face in real life, which I get. It seems like a helpful outlet for them to get away from that. Ok.

But, a friend of theirs (B) they brought into the group is also trans and really seems to be struggling with it. Even before coming out (to me anyway) they were always wanting to play shapeshifters etc. Basically any character with a hidden identity, and to play those characters as ashamed of and nudge them into embarrassing situations about it. Now that they are out they want to play trans characters and have them actively grapple with that in-game.

The conflict here is obvious. The game is on hiatus for unrelated reasons about the holiday season. I want to figure this out in the meantime.

I hope to encourage them to work it out between themselves. That's not because I'm afraid of the subject though there is a lot I don't understand about it. Rather, A and B know each other much better than I know B. They already talk about trans issues a lot and I think they are dodging this one because they don't want to hurt each other's feelings. If they can get past that they are better equipped for the conversation than I am.

If I must come down on one ""side"" it would be with the A who doesn't want the issue to come up. This is in large part because I think it's good as a rule to let players veto sensitive topics without much pushback. But, I wouldn't know how to let down B gently on the subject.

Anway... anyone have some relevant stories or advice here? I thought about asking in a trans sub but it's also in the context of TTRPGs.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2940b4ec0>,rpg,1608225505.0
bzelh3,Back to the Beginning - a Solo game for creating backstories - available for free,"Hello there, I'm Arty, the main developer for this little project, and I'm giving it out for free.

Do you struggle to write compelling backstories for your characters?

[Back to the Beginning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C7dJwbQNYP9c0lpCFn1GGD2aozA4N2iK/view?usp=sharing) is a little solo STG (storytelling game) made for creating vibrant backstories for characters. It's really simple. You just draw cards, roll dice, and get writing prompts, and then move to the next prompt. So where's the trick?

As the name might clue you in, the game's narrative flows backwards. The first writing prompt you get is the last event that happens to the character before the end of the game. This creates an interesting dynamic where you can engineer a butterfly effect for the character's actions, making the last actions you make in the game, no matter how benign, more meaningful by the fact that the ending has already been written.

Feel free to try it out, leave comments or criticisms. I tried it out myself, and I was quite pleased with the results.

It's not really that much of an RPG as it is a writing prompt generator, but one of its primary purposes is to be able to create backstories for characters, and thus it could prove very useful to many people here.

hzi4pz,Don’t turn your fantasy novel idea into an rpg campaign.,"This is a problem. If it is not your problem, keep scrolling, but enough people I know have had this problem that I feel this post is justified.

Reasons why:

1: Good novels make bad games. Bad games make good novels. D&D universe novels are infamously terrible, but everyone knows they would make kickass campaigns if you had players who were that dedicated to role playing. Lord of the Rings, as an rpg campaign, would be railroaded as fuck with too many PCs and massive power/plot importance disparities between them.

2: The GMs I’ve played with who are the most personally invested in their own ideas tend to be the worst GMs. They might be uncomfortable with player creativity or thinking outside the box, often to the point of restricting options that actually are in the game because it doesn’t fit into “their universe.” They might make the lore (that they wrote) far too “mysterious” (inaccessible) for the players with this assumption that it will be “fascinating” when they discover it. They might edit player backstories to fit more to their lore. The worst is when the inaccessible lore combines with editing player backstories.

“This doesn’t work.”
“Why not?”
“I can’t tell you. Do this instead.”

3: Novels are inherently character-based and about a protagonist. Who is your protagonist? If it’s the PCs, they’re going to get railroaded. If it’s an NPC, fuck you. (Sorry, not going to be nice about that one) If it’s your antagonist, you’re probably going to end up being a dick to your players.

There are probably other reasons.

How do I know this is such a big problem? Simple: I did it.

And I can say from personal experience: don’t. No one will have a good time. Including you.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29425b770>,rpg,1595954903.0

I, and many other Kickstarter Backers, have yet to receive large portions of our backed rewards, and Artisan Dice has stopped updating the Kickstarter (the last update was July 2017) or responding to anything other than direct e-mails. They've blocked several people from their Facebook page for inquiring about the Kickstarter.

When the Kickstarter began, six years ago, Artisan Dice was just making wooden dice, and through the Kickstarter was expanding into metal. Since the Kickstarter has ended, they've only made a fraction of the metal dice types they said they were going to (for a fun time, check out their website's customer reviews on the metal dice pages which are just full of people asking when they'll be available). They've managed to expand into stone, acrylic, bone (most recently, walrus penis bone, which they posted about four times in the last few days), horn, and compressed hops, but haven't managed to fulfill Kickstarter orders.

I should add, it isn't just Kickstarter orders that don't get filled, but other customers regularly post on their Facebook page asking about orders a year or two unfilled. I'm just fixated on the SIX YEAR unfulfilled Kickstarter stuff because it is the anniversary today.

The RPG community doesn't need the kind of shady businessmen in it that Artisan Dice have displayed themselves to be. Please, for the sake of everyone who hasn't gotten what they've paid for with these guys, don't support this business.

1fk7y7u,Friendly PSA: Do Not Order Physical Miniatures from Hero Forge ,"Just a friendly PSA:

Hero Forge's original distributor (Shapeways) went bankrupt July 2024. However, Hero Forge is still taking orders for physical miniatures without a distributor. I placed an order on August 9th, but my order is still TBD with no delivery date in sight. You may want to buy the STL files instead and print them yourself or have someone else print them for you.

Update: My original order from August 6th was lost or never scanned or whatever. It's been in transit for at least two weeks and hasn't moved. I contacted customer service and asked for a refund. I was given a $10 credit instead. I was also told that a new miniature would be sent my way but I have no real confirmation from Hero Forge that it was ordered and shipped. Instead of a $10 credit, I asked for and was given the codes for two STL files so that I could print these myself or have a 3rd party print them. I will update this post once I receive the miniature.

\*\*\*Last Edit\*\*\*:

My colored Hero Forge miniature arrived today, October 5th. It was ordered on August 9th. I believe $55 for the miniature is a waste of money. In the future, if I use Hero Forge, I will create and purchase the STL files to print myself. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2942de450>,rpg,1726705462.0

5hd12b,Losing a Player,"Three months ago, one of my closer online RP buds was involved in a hit and run. He didn't make it. I only found out one month after the incident, and had assumed he was simply online less because of his new job at the time. Finally finding out left me not knowing what to feel. We had gamed online consistently for a good four years, and had kept in contact through highs and lows, despite frequent arguing and clashes of opinion. 

I was the forever-GM, he was my omnipresent, ever-eager player. Often the driving force in any given campaign's party, and a battery of enthusiasm for everyone to feed off.  

But we had never personally met. There was this inexplicable feeling of disconnect when I found out he was gone. 

I spent the next few days digging up all I could about his online activity. After finally finding a facebook account connected to his, I saw one of his pictures for the first time. And then the sadness hit. He was finally another human being to me. 

I'm posting this here because it's a story I need to tell, and my relatives and work friends will never really understand that connection between a GM and his player. 

So yeah, the next time you're in some pedantic, nerdy as argument with someone in your group, take a step back to appreciate it! That kind of close-knit, hobby oriented relationship is a terrible thing to lose :(

His IRL best friend still refuses to chat with me, but I don't begrudge him that. They were the closer pair. I also contacted his mother, to offer my condolences. That gave me the most closure.

As for storytimes: recording and retelling our shenanigans has always been a fixation of mine. It's gotten a lot more painful then necessary recently, but I have a particular excerpt from our old pokemon game I enjoy sharing.

**SCENARIO**: 

Monty Jumps the Pit 

*Dramatis Personae*:

**Monty**: My friend's character, easily his favorite. A young vagabond with a supernatural sway over fungi

**Kaze**: A flying type specialist, owner of the scene's Noivern 

**Bertrand**: An aspiring pokemon breeder. 



*Scene*:

Bert and Kaze, riding Kaze's flying Noivern, are leading a Beedrill hive through the woods, trying to get them to settle in a big tree away from a local village. Monty is also interested in the tree the bees are going to inhabit, and is keeping up with the Noivern on-foot, as he does. 

>Soak (GM): Monty, you're running straight ahead, and manage to glimpse an obvious gap in the otherwise unbroken undergrowth. It's sizeable, and looks deep. You'd likely have to navigate quite a ways to get around it. It does however look narrow enough to jump.

>Bertrand: Don't tell him THAT

>Monty: bout how wide does the gap look? 

Monty decides to play it safe, and run around the gap instead. . . 

>Soak (GM): You slow down, and bank left. It affords you a better view of the sudden hole in the ground, which looks to have a bunch of shining multicolored crystal formations clustered about the bottom of it.
You can't see ALL the way down, though.

>Monty: Hrm

>Monty:temptation

>Bertrand: Jump in. do it. 

. . .but he soon changes his mind

>Monty: ""Hey Bert, dont worry about me, Ima explore this cave!""

>Monty: I jump in

>Kaze: ""Monty....oh....this isn't going to be good.""

>Soak (GM): Lemme clarify that, you jump IN, not across?

>Monty: yes. 

So he does.
>Soak (GM): Monty, you sail into the gap, catching a glimpse of a veritable rainbow of sharp crystal formations before you start plummeting down towards them. At this point you realize they all look rather uncomfortable.

>Monty: no fear.

>Soak (GM): I'll need you to roll acrobatics to try and minimize fall damage. Open to any other ideas as well,.

>Monty: I activate my druids call feature, spending 1 AP to grow a gigantor mushroom up to 6 meters away from me, in this case; directly underneath me on the ground.

We spend a few minutes figuring out the ranges and the cost of his Druid's Call feature. He decides to let himself fall a bit further, so he can get close enough to the pit's bottom to have them pop out from there. 

>Monty: Lets burn my full AP; 6 of it, to properly mushroom my fall up.

>Soak (GM): You pick a spot, channel that spirit flow, and give the ground beneath you a bit of a mental pull.

>Monty: I must channel the Parasect hivemind shrooms that have infected my brain in order to save myself

>Soak (GM): The result is a bit delayed, and the shroom grows out at an angle, shoving some of the crystals out of the way as it bursts out of the ground.

>Monty: Im like the manchurian canidate, but with hivemind-shrooms.

>Soak (GM): It pops out right where you visualized it, but is slightly askew due to the ground not being all ground anymore. It doesn't take much of an effort to land right on it, but the succeeding impact and cloud of harmless spores does manage to wind and choke you a fair bit.

>Soak (GM): You take all of 7 damage and suffer from a twisted...

>Bertrand: butt

>Soak (GM): Arm! You'll also suffer a penalty to melee attacks until somebody patches you up.

>Monty: no fear. no regrets. just ADVENTURE. 
 
*End Scene*

He ends up harvesting a lot of those crystals, using one of them to craft himself a crystal-tipped spear, Monty's iconic end-game weapon.

But finally she said she had a friend who wanted to play with her, so I wrote a campaign, helped them make characters, and we played for like 10 minutes and it was fun. Then I guess her friend sent her some drama, and she immediately lost interest in dnd, and it was weird because now I'm narrating what's in the next room and both players are on their phones seemingly not paying attention, and I didn't know how to stop playing without being an asshole.

So, it's Spring now, and we're still in Ukraine, and things are still going boom. Morning started from checking on friends in Kharkiv, and me being me, all the people I know in Kharkiv are either doctors or Ukrainian fantasy writers. Seems that they're okay, despite the city having been bombed yesterday and today. 

Home chat pings, one of the neighbours brings everyone's attention to the fact that the air raid alarm has been howling for a while now. Swell. From what I know, it's safer to stay inside than to grab the clothes and the bag and run to the shelter. Besides, so far it's only howling but not booming. 

While the alarm continues, I distract myself with roleplaying props. Like I said before, I love paper minis. With things being what they are, I began to think we should have more Ukrainian elements in our sessions. Like, some local monsters and folklore creatures. And some cool minis for the characters. 

I found a couple nice pictures of cossacks on DeviantArt, drawn by dPERCHY and RADIVILOVSKAY. A little tinkering with my printer and my scissors, and voila. I think these would do a nice Barbarian and Bard. After the alarm was over I put them on a flag and took a picture.

gxq8np,"I challenged myself to create another One Million square-feet of original battle maps in 1 month, so here it is Deeper Dungeons all free for you to download and use.","  

Hey folks, I decided to do another One Million square-feet of battlemaps. It’s been a while so this time I thought I’d do a multi-level dungeon.

Deeper Dungeons is another set of 1 million square feet of map, this time exploring 7 levels, from the ruined castle (outdoors), into the dungeon below, and then heading into the caves, only to head further down into a long-lost dungeon complex, from there we delve into the tombs below and finally end up in the Hell Mouth. A total of 16 50inch x 50inch maps.

Please remember, all of my maps, including these (and the gridded versions) are completely free, it’s a way to give back to a hobby that I have enjoyed so much for over 36 years. All I ask is that you don’t sell them, and you credit me wherever possible (if possible).

Some people have been asking if there is an easier way to download these sets, so I have managed to get myself some extra space on Google Drive, zip the map sets into handy folders and put them out there for you to download as full sets. This has cost me a little, so I hope you understand that if you want the sets, you will have to send me a donation on my Ko-Fi page (any size donation will do), and in the ‘thank you’ message, you will find a link to the drive with all the map of my map sets on, including the following:

The Original One Million

One Million Island

One Million Dungeon Dimensions (this is a big one)

… and I have even put on my old Dwarf map set, and the full set of chromatic and metallic dragon lairs and entrances (including night versions)

My page, once you support me, includes the link to all of the Deeper Dungeon maps, including the grid and no grid versions (and hi-res versions of all of them).

That’s a total of over 7 million square feet of battlemap.

Here’s the links:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dq_1G1Zh_cMQil-BYT1QqsTTTwLhB94Bz8IW7-1an6M/edit - Google doc version for those who prefer the page view.

Silence, Brand is a 20-page improvisational RPG about a group of anti-corporate activists who give everything they have to fighting the machine. It uses only a single d6, with statistics simple enough for a full character sheet to fit on a flashcard.

Featuring:

-Three very different modes of play, to showcase the wide 
variety of means for direct action.

-A reputation stat that players can use to influence their success rate.

-Bonuses for undertaking real life action, just like the Wendy's RPG--though none that require you to buy and eat what is essentially garbage.

-Absolutely no art of any kind.

-Roughly as much playtesting as acclaimed RPG products like Shadowrun and Exalted.

Take a look, and have fun!

**EDIT**: Just some quick errata:

-Paying 5 reputation to match a roll tieing a target number is way too high. This is has now been changed to 1.

-Added a clarification that the Clout gained from Reputation is only acquired at the end of a Vignette, not Scene.

-Added information about scenes that occur outside of a proper mode of play (i.e., downtime) 

-Added a clarification that donating to good causes can usually only be done during the end of a session or during downtime, and therefore does not add Clout.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29539b4a0>,rpg,1570297245.0

18u0513,Ending a 15 year Game Group,"Well, that was the saddest email I've sent in a while.  I've been gaming with the same guys for 15 years and I just called it quits.  As the forever DM, host, and organizer I've finally had enough regarding chasing people down regarding availability.  Dealing with one guy who, after 10 years, still hasn't learned how to play Savage Worlds. And general lack of effort by my players.  I don't mind putting in the extra time to prep/plan, but when I send an email asking about shifting a couple nights and get a response from 1 of the 5 players, I'm done.  When I spend 2 or 3 hours reading a source book for ideas and they can't send a 1 minute response if they can make a certain day.......I guess it ran its course.

I'm sitting here raising a glass of bourbon feeling pretty darn sad right now.  These guys are some of my best friends.

How many other forever DMs, hosts, and organizers have burnt out for the same reason?

Update:  
Apparently my email took most of the group off guard.  One guy offered to take over all the organization and I agreed with 2 conditions.  The first is more input from them about everything.  It's exhausting hearing, I'll play whatever and then picking something not knowing if they are happy with the choice.  The other was more outside engagement.  When I say level up, come prepared to level up, don't waste 30+ minutes trying to figure it out at the game.  Time will tell.

10ok554,Random PSA: be patient with the indie RPG companies you're ordering new books from.,"I know a lot of people are branching out and trying new games right now. Just wanted to mention that sometimes indie rpg companies can take weeks to ship stuff, and that's normal.

Some of them are probably experiencing an unprecedented level of orders and I've heard at least a few have had to do reprints. This stuff takes time and often needs to ship internationally from the printer. Not to mention some of these companies are just a handful of people-- or even just one-- manually handling their own shipping.

Also, it's not con season, but if anyone is touring doing cons and they're suddenly hit with a bunch of orders, that could be a logistics issue for them as well.

The end product is worth it. A little patience can be a big reward. Also, don't forget to check your local game shop. Some of them have huge ttrpg selections and you might get your product more quickly.

* Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying 4e
* The Witcher Pen and Paper RPG
* Zweihander Grim and Perilous RPG Revised Edition

I've organized the list into multiple tiers of ubiquity, beginning with the Monster Appearance List (Blue), containing every monster that made at least two total appearances in the 50 games surveyed. Beyond that are five increasingly-strict tiers:

* The Lax tier (Copper) has a 10% threshold: any creature that logged at least five appearances in fifty games appears in the lax tier. Things feel good and complete here.

* The Average tier (Bronze) applies a minimum 20% threshold. Only monsters that appear in at least 10 of the 50 RPGs surveyed are on its list.

* The Strict Tier (Silver) applies a 34% threshold to the monster list. Of the 50 RPGs surveyed, at least 17 featured these favored few monsters.

* The Super Strict Tier (Gold) applies a 50% threshold. If it's fantasy you want, you have coin-flip odds of encountering these top-tier beasts!

* And lastly, the prestigious Impossible Tier (Royal Purple) is host to the monsters it almost seems like a fantasy world can't be without! Only nine lucky monsters reached this tier-- is one of your favorites on it?

In addition we have four special lists:

* Feel like taking things in a more classic direction? The Close Calls: D&D-influenced (White) chart is for you! This list counts 1e, BECMI, 4e, and 5e for double, listing the monsters that would have been upgraded from Copper to Bronze tier if we had done so all along!

* Or maybe you'd rather get out from under D&D's shadow a little? The Close Calls: D&D-Null (Pink) chart contains the monsters that would hit a 20% threshold of 9 total games-- without any official version of D&D or Pathfinder 2e in the mix whatsoever!

Lastly we have two appendices:

* The Unexpurgated Monster List (Green) is a complete list of all monsters that appeared in the survey at least once.

* The Unique Monster List (Red) records all monsters who made only a single appearance in the list across all 50 titles!

**Where Do We Go From Here?**

That's a good question and I'm glad you asked! I created this list in the interest of pursuing the scholarly study of tropes, traditions, and cliches in fantasy RPGs. To that end I'd like to turn to the roleplaying community in search of further expansion upon the chart. Every entry on the list (more than 1400 in the complete, unexpurgated list), with the exception of well-known natural creatures and a few other classics sufficiently universal and consistent to take for granted, has been annotated with a definition explaining what the entry represents-- in part to account for differences in nomenclature applying to similar concepts.

The first thing this could use is peer review. Have I neglected any entries, or made a judgment call you don't agree with? This is the place to reach out to me about it! 

The second thing I'd like to do next is to create other special lists, studies, and other information that could arise from the data I've collected. If you have any suggestions for studies or experiments that could be performed using the information at hand, reach out to me about them and I'll be happy to conduct them. I believe there is much to learn from what I've assembled here, but I'm not always the best at creative, lateral applications of it, so I turn to the community to ask what we can create next.

Edit: A few people have reached out to me about this so I just wanted to clarify:

#I generally only used the core rules for each game listed. On occasion I used a single supplemental bestiary where I felt the core rules were running short or where the supplemental bestiary was in universal usage. In only one case (The One Ring) did I use any more than that because TOR is extremely sparse on monsters. You can see in the notes for the first row what products were included for each game.

This means for instance that I didn't include the Fiend Folio and Monster Manual II under AD&D 1e, just the Monster Manual. That *alone* accounted for the second-biggest set of monsters in this entire project with over 300 entries.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2954d50d0>,rpg,1621115205.0

It's a pretty common refrain I've heard more than once: ""There aren't enough DMs to go around! Everyone wants to play, but no one wants to run games!""

Everyone wants to play? *Really?*

Suppose I tell you that I'm going to start running a game of D&D, and I'm looking for players. Do you want to join up?

Now, suppose I tell you that I'm not allowing homebrew, and I'm running the game RAW. Are you still interested?

Now, imagine that I'm telling you that it's a PHB-only game. Still up for it?

Or imagine that it's not D&D at all, but a nice high-fantasy game of Savage Worlds, and ""D&D"" is just a term people throw around, like ""Xerox"" and ""Kleenex."" *What about now?*

The problem isn't that there's a shortage of DMs/GMs/whatever, the problem is that there's a shortage of people who will run games *to your exacting specifications*. People expect D&D to be like Monopoly or Risk; everyone's using the same rules out of the box, so if my last two DMs let me take character options from Xanathar's, but this DM won't, that clearly means there's a ""DM shortage.""

There is no DM shortage. There's just an excess of spoiled players who refuse to play in games that will give them everything they desire.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2956083e0>,rpg,1670593153.0

96swom,"Report: Netflix ""Audio Description"" has made me a much better Game Master","Some time ago, I was listening to a bonus episode on some gaming podcast - I don't remember which one anymore, but I'm sure someone else will - that was talking about DM advice. One of the weird almost throw-away suggestions was to use Audio Description options in Netflix. I laughed, but still decided to give it a try.

Several months later, I can attest that it was the wise thing to do. My partner _hates_ it when they watch things with me, but they are getting used to it. It's made me a better GM/DM, and my games both tabletop and recorded have vastly improved because of it.

What am I talking about? Netflix (and possibly Amazon?) has an option on most if not all of its original programming - and others too - where you can select ""English - Audio Description"" as an Audio choice. When you do so, you hear the normal dialog, but there is also a narrator telling you what is physically happening on the screen as well. It doesn't interrupt the actors, either. I've experienced this long ago when renting movies from the local public library that were ""enhanced for the vision impaired"" or such - my first exposure was Breakfast at Tiffany's, in fact.

I've turned it on by default, and now everything I watch uses it when available. It has really expanded my ability to describe scenes and events in-game, and I highly encourage anyone who wants to step up their GMing game to give it a shot. The way the narrators describe things is pretty interesting, and has even expanded my regular vocabulary.

Give it a shot, let me know what you think.

EDIT: Oh yeah, advance warning here, that sometimes the narration is a few seconds ahead of the actual action on screen, I suspect due to it not wanting to conflict with dialog. So sometimes events will be described a few seconds before they happen. So if you're the kind who is bothered by like three-second spoilers, it might not be for you. it's definitely an ""acquired taste"" so to speak.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29578a990>,rpg,1534112475.0
6zvdq7,Watching kids MacGyvering their way through a dungeon is my favorite part of DMing.,"I was playing [Maze Rats](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197158/Maze-Rats?affiliate_id=379088) with twelve 5th-graders yesterday (the other teacher wasn't there so I had to combine groups) and sent them through a dungeon. Once the game had begun, they realized that they had only one torch between them. One girl took it with her as she squirmed through some iron bars into a secret passage, leaving the rest of the group in darkness.

Me: ""How are the rest of you going to continue? You can't do anything in pitch blackness.""

Jeremy: ""I break off the handle of my shovel. I'm saving the head for later in case it's useful. [*It was.*] Now I'm going to dip the top of the handle into the grease that Zoey brought. And Tristan has flint and tinder, so we're going to light it on fire.""

y2ytvy,"An appeal to future game designers: Consider the term ""species"".","Boy oh boy has this become a kerfuffle. 

Racial stats are racist. Racial stats are not racist. Racial stats are a reflection of cultural assumptions. Racial stats are a reflection of biology.   

This argument is never gonna end and while discussions of the gameplay implications are cool n' all, it's pretty clear everyone's sick of the rest of it.  

Long story short, if you've got Elves n' Dwarves n' shit, I think the kicker here is those aren't ""races"" if you're being pedantic.  
A lot of the discomfort lies in conflating a *different species* to different ""races"" of human beings.  

A Dwarf is not to a Human as an Indian human is to a central African human. In most RPG settings these are fairly different comparisons.   

If conflating the two makes you uncomfortable, but you still want those ""racial bonuses""... Consider picking a **species** rather than a **race**. It's certainly what I'm doing for my Mythras hack.  

Does this make any sense or am I spouting some crazy bullshit?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29598d040>,rpg,1665667863.0
fbxjvr,Over the last year I have created millions of square feet of battlemaps for our community. These are now available all in one place.,"Hi folks,

&#x200B;

**UPDATE:** I need to accept payments before you get the link to the maps... it's apparently a PayPal thing. I have to do this manually, and I now need to go to work. So, if you do donate, please be aware that I'll be able to accept periodically, throughout the day. Thank you for your patience! 

&#x200B;

Over the last year I have been creating battlemaps for our community to use. I have created 3 projects of ‘One Million’ square feet of maps (well, one of those was 2.25 million square feet). All the maps are ready for use in virtual tabletops.

There are versions with grids, no grids, and even night versions for those maps that are set outdoors.

My maps are free, and a way to give back to the community that I have been part of for almost 4 decades. You can find all the free versions on my Deviant Art page.

Some people have been asking if there is an easier way to download these sets, so I have managed to get myself some extra space on Google Drive, zip the map sets into handy folders and put them out there for you to download as full sets. This has cost me a little, so I hope you understand that if you want the sets, you will have to send me a donation on my Ko-Fi page (any size donation will do), and in the ‘thank you’ message, after I accept the payment, you will find a link to the drive with all the map sets on, including the following:

The Original One Million

One Million Island

One Million Dungeon Dimensions (this is a big one)

… and I have even put on my old Dwarf map set.

A total of over 5 million square feet of battlemap.

10djpv6,Worlds Without Number is worth a look,"I've enjoyed reading the posts by other people recommending the systems they like, so I thought I would recommend one of my favorites, _Worlds Without Number_. 

**Why should you check it out?**

Well, first of all, I think it's fun to play...it's got a nice mix of rules that are easily accessible, especially for anyone with D&D experience.  More on that in a minute.  But that's just my opinion, people like different sorts of RPGs.

However, there are two other reasons that you might want to look at it, regardless of whether or not you expect to actually play it:  

1)  It's mostly [available for free](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348809/Worlds-Without-Number-Free-Edition).  The free version contains the vast bulk of what I'm about to talk about.  The [paid version](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348791/Worlds-Without-Number) has a few extra classes and rules for high level play.

2) It's got really neat system-neutral GM tools for generating content that you can use in just about any fantasy themed rpg.  Can't beat that kind of value for your money.     

**What sort of game is this?**

_Worlds Without Number_ is inspired by the broader [OSR](https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/roleplaying-game/feature/what-is-osr-old-school-rpg-classic-dnd) (Old School Renaissance) movement.  In particular, it favors a sandbox style of play where players set their own goals, the world is dangerous, and fighting isn't always the best option.  

The rules for combat will be pretty familiar to anyone used to playing D&D or other games derived from it...the standard six attributes, roll a 20 to attack, etc.  (However, it _doesn't_ use the OGL).  There is a skill system that is similar to the one used in _Traveler_.  You roll 2d6, add your skill level and an attribute.  There are three major classes, skill focused experts, combat focused warriors, and magic focused mages.  These can be combined with each other or mixed with various subclasses to produce a wide variety of characters.  And there are foci (feats/special abilities) that let you customize your character even further.     

**Why do I like it?**

1) I like the skill system.  There's enough meat on it that it doesn't feel like an afterthought to combat.  The skill list isn't too big, but really does a good job of covering almost everything.  And the 2d6 system makes skill rolls more consistent than d20 rolls in D&D.  There's a pretty sweet crafting system tied into it too.  

2) Combat goes pretty fast, but it's got enough options to keep me interested.  One way this differs from other systems is the addition of shock damage...if you melee attack someone, and their armor is low enough, you'll _always_ do a few HP worth of damage, even if you miss.  This represents the minor injuries resulting from close combat that occur even when there's no direct hit.  This helps keep combat moving along, since you are almost always losing HP.  Players also have options for things to do in combat besides direct attacks, but there aren't so many that they are hard to keep track of.

3) The ability to combine classes, the foci, and the skills provide enough crunch to character creation to keep me interested.  You may think a game with only three classes would be lacking in character options, but between different subclasses and the ability to combine two half-classes, plus a variety of foci (feats, basically), plus being able to specialize in different skills, there's a lot of ways to build a character.  This gets even more true if you use classes from the paid version or the setting book, _[The Atlas of Latter Earth](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/416284/The-Atlas-of-the-Latter-Earth)_.    The downside is that this does mean that you can't just spin up a character in a few moments, like you can with some other OSR games.  

4)  The GM tools are really handy.  There are lots of tables to roll on for ideas, plus methods for setting up a hexcrawl map, making a dungeon, and even a method for running factions.
 
5) Characters are really good at what they do.  This isn't a game where the warriors get outclassed at killing stuff by wizards tossing fireballs.  But wizard spells are also really powerful.  And experts get more skills and are better at using them.  

6) There's a compatible scifi version, _[Stars Without Number](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/230009/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition-Free-Version)_.  I was running a game set in a scifi-fantasy mashup (using the awesome setting of Ultraviolet Grasslands) and it was really handy to be able to draw a lot of material from Stars Without Number.  A niche use, I know, but really handy for me.  There's also an upcoming cyberpunk version, _Cities Without Number_, but it's not out yet.

7) There's a lot of compatible materials.  Like a lot of OSR games, you can pretty much pull monsters or adventures from other OSR systems or old DnD modules, which means there's plenty of content out there to pull from.

I am the author of an indie-rpg called **Slay the Dragon!** and today it came to my attention that my game has been used to start a heated argument which went as far as the post being tweeted by Indestructoboy. I am writing this to share a perspective of a creator being on the receiving end of the stick because and also to share why I think that rhetoric presented by OP is actively harmful to what he wants to achieve.

**By being oblivious to the context, you are actively discouraging foreign authors from attempts to publish abroad.** 

In certain countries such as Poland where I come from the access to D&D is not as easy as in USA. It might be expensive, it might be hard to get, and it might not be available in the local language altogether. I created Slay the Dragon to be affordable, have a box set form and be easily accessible due to the generic fantasy theme. The game was warmly received, so I decided to share it with the international audience. By being ignorant to that context and claiming it’s just another unnecessary take on D&D, you are making it harder for us to do it. 

**Instead of complaining about D&D, give few indie games a real shot and you might actually see that a lot of them are more similar to the games you mentioned as ones you like.** 

Everything will be D&D if you are so desperate to see it everywhere. I won’t deny, yes my game is about dungeon crawling, yest it uses the popular d20 die and yes it is written with generic fantasy in mind. But it is also so much more. It actually makes dungeon exploration a mechanic within the game. And it binds this mechanic with combat and other parts of the game via the system of abstract resources. Resources that are abstract in order to bring a little bit of the joy of spontaneous creativity from story games into it. But to get all of that, you actually need to read into the game. Please do not make superficial judgments, just to have something to complain about.

**The post as the one that started the conversation might be enough to bury a project such as us together with all the love and work we gave it.** 

It’s incredibly hard to be an indie creator as it is. For me, publishing my games is a way of sharing results of a process I love. My game didn’t start as a scheme to make a quick buck. Me and the illustrator of the game who is a dear friend of mine wanted to create something together, and so we did. Hundreds of hours later, we had something we were proud of. But that’s only a small part of the battle, as we have to reach an audience. And without marketing resources to rival corporations or being in the inner circle of people who like to fashion themselves indie-rpg content creators, it’s really hard task. So please, for the love of god, think about the consequence of your actions.

hvregu,"My players lost a fight I thought they'd win, and I'm excited for the outcome.","For the past... month or so, my party have been working to bring down their Sorcerer's Mother, who was revealed to be a vampire. They've been scouring the city for any evidence of her wrongdoing, and planning to bring her down by means fair and foul. It all started to come to a climax last week when they planned, with the assistance of the local authorities, to unmask her at a party, and trap her. However, all did not go exactly to plan and the Vampire escaped (in the form of a Giant Bat) from the party and retreated to her lair. The party quickly chased across the city to catch up, and having finally dealt with her minions, confronted her at the top of her tower...

&#x200B;

And then they lost.

&#x200B;

The fight was a hard one, and lasted the entirety of the 3 hour session we had, and swung from ""we're easily going to win"" to ""Oh god, the barbarian and sorcerer will die if they get hit one more time and the fighter is dominated and quickly being drained to death"" in the space of a round, it felt like. 

Through some last minute heroics from the Cleric and Alchemist, they escaped, and fled to the closest cathedral to recover, where we ended the session.

&#x200B;

I am so excited for the next session. We built everything to a crescendo, and then they suffered a crushing defeat over something they really cared about. It's something I've never experienced in a game before. I've run hard fights, and I've run fights the players have had to flee from before, but it's never been over something so important to the players. I know I just said it, but I am honestly so excited for the RP moments that are going to come from it. 

&#x200B;

I'm not sure I could ever pull something off so beautifully if I'd planned it, tbh. I had expected them to win, but I honestly think the loss will be a way better story moment, and be something we remember about the campaign for ages.

jbrir7,"After 3 years I'm finally launching The Wildsea TTRPG, a game of cutting your way across treetop waves on a chainsaw-driven ship","So I'll keep this brief and informative - self-promotion is not my usual wheelhouse, but we just got picked up for publishing by [Mythopoeia](https://www.mythopoeia.us/wildsea.html), so everything is full steam ahead right now! We've had an absolutely wonderful response to the Wildsea so far, and I'd love for as many people to see it as possible. 


**Mechanics**

The Wildsea draws mechanically from Belly of the Beast, Blades in the Dark, 13th Age and Dialect, and also from video games like Bastion, Sunless Sea and Subnautica. It has a heavy narrative slant, a dash of in-character worldbuilding and a focus on dramatic action and exploration. This is weird fantasy, through and through. 


**Setting**

It takes place on a treetop sea, the canopy of a vast forest that ate the world. You play wildsailors, crews of those brave (or foolhardy) enough to set out across the rustling waves in ships of your own creation. You might be a weathered descendant of humanity, a towering cactoid, a spry fungal hunter or a hive-mind of spiders in a humanesque skin. 


**Links and General**

[We're heading to Kickstarter on October 28th](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mythopoeia/the-wildsea), but we've already released an updated version of the [Quickstart Rules](https://thewildseadotcodotuk.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/the-wildsea-quickstart-playtest-b.pdf
) that you can grab and enjoy whether you back us or not. There's enough there for a one-shot, or even a small campaign, but there's also a lot we've held back for the final product. Ideally, we want everyone to be able to experience the Wildsea if they want to, no matter their financial situation. You can get the full lowdown on the project on the [Wildsea website](https://thewildsea.co.uk/2020/10/02/updated-playtest-new-publisher-kickstarter-plans/), or join the [Wildsea discord](https://discord.gg/jFNs2Qg) - we had our first pieces of original music posted there in the past few days, one of which we actually ended up using for our [teaser trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjaOshV9Ym8).

kfwgo2,"As much as I love world-building and plotting, this is why I GM.","Received this message out of the blue today from one of my players:

>Hey man, hope you're having a good day. I just wanted to drop a line because I was thinking about \[campaign\] today and don't know if I've told you how much fun I'm having. I was talking with \[player\] and telling them that I don't remember if I've ever had a campaign that I was more engaged with or one that I've craved more sessions with. Your presentation and world-building has been fantastic and it makes me think of those college rpg days where I felt like I could have played till 2 in the morning. That's about the breadth of what I wanted to say. Just wanted you to know I'm really glad you decided to pick up this system and run a game with us. I am having the time of my life. Alright, dude. Hope you're having a good day and I'll talk to you later. 

Made me tear up a bit. We're part of a group that's been gaming together since college, and switched to virtual when we all split up and went home to different states. It's been almost a decade now, and they're still the best bunch of people I've ever played with. 

For a bit of context, this last spring we came off of a two and a half year, 90-session D&D 5e campaign that I ran. I was growing tired both of 5e and of fantasy, so for the next thing I moved to [Stars Without Number](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/230009/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition-Free-Version). None of us had played it before, although I'd been reading it and mulling it over for a year beforehand. 

We're now 29 sessions in, and SWN has firmly cemented itself as my favorite RPG. It's wonderfully flexible, and I always feel like the system is working with me, rather than limiting me in the way I often felt with 5e. I can't recommend it enough.

2gnvi5,Priest didn't like being railroaded.,"We have this GM who has a real problem with railroading. (Think: that scene in The Truman Show when he tries to leave the town and the road catches fire. We've talked to him about it and in our last game he started to get a little better about it. Then he got a huge idea for a campaign and we agreed as long as he didn't railroad us. We started out in an underground prison, once we surfaced we found ourselves in the edge of a swamp. there were a few people running out of the swamp heading to the town to the north. We stopped them and found out they had to flea from their home in the south because of a legion of vampires destroying everything. Our party leader, a Priest, said we should do some recon in the swamp to see what we're up against. Literally the entire legion of vampires (lead by their king) is standing shin deep in the swamp waters stopping us from going that direction. I can see that's the last straw for Priest.

Priest:""Is it a dry season?""

GM: ""What?""

P:""Like, there's water in the swamp right?""

GM: ""Yeah, you guys are shin deep in it, making it very difficult to move through the swamp. However it is dry up north in the town, and you haven't been spotted so you can head that way.""

P:""But there is water.""

GM: ""Yes...""

P: ""I bless the water""

GM: ""Fuck off, Brandon.""





Edit: We weren't playing 3.5, I don't know why everyone's made that assumption.

Some of them are childhood friends, and were among the first people I DM'ed for, over 15 years ago. We had our ups and downs, both in ""real life"" and ""in game"", but we always have had a  crazy ammount of fun. 

Before we even finished our 10-year long Star Wars campaign, all of us knew what we were going to play next: Midnight. Midnight is an extremely well-written d&d 3.5 dark fantasy setting from Fantasy Flight Games, which explores the themes of desperate heroism in a doomed world, like a darker ""what if Morgoth won forever"" version of Middle Earth. I was a big fan of the setting since it was first published, and through the years I had purchased every sourcebook of the line.

Now, I must say that our Star Wars campaign had it all: laughs, cries, light hearted themes, dark themes, sacrifice, personal growth. I knew it would be difficult for all of us to do better than that, but we were all about to try with our new game. So I got to work. I wrote the broad script for a campaign that would take 3-4 years of gaming. We rolled characters and I designed each one's personal story. 

Sidenote: a few months after we started our new campaign, I quit my previous job and got a new one which was infinitely more demanding. I had to work 11-14 hours per day, and it quickly exhausted me both physically and mentally. 

On a ""positive"" note, my new job quickly caused my mood to go downhill, which really made writing about Midnight seem a natural process. Dark themes and desperation were living constntly in my head, so it was easy for me to bring them to our table. And it was a success. The players loved it. My beast friend wrote a poem after one particularly emotional session. As members of a doomed resistance, I even caught them whispering irl while discussing tactics/roleplaying in their hideaway. That was when I understood that I was not having fun with the game. Because, I need humor in my games, as much as I need adult themes. I need a rainbow of emotions, a changing of mood. I cannot fully express myself otherwise.

After 2 years in my ""new"" job, which caused me health problems (and depression which I kept secret from everyone even after I recongized that I had it), I quit. And soon after, I told my players I would take a break from Midnight, after one and a half years of running it. Soon after, I told them that I was not returning to the game. They never made a scene or anything. They were dissapointed, but they understood. 

 All of us began a new campaign in the Witcher rpg, which was like a healing potion for me. For the past year I am running the game, and I am driving my players crazy by buying new rpgs every now and then, ""threatening"" them that they are soon going to have to learn new systems because I want to play a ton of things, like I did when I was younger.

Only ""bad"" thing is, one member of our group didn't want to play anymore. One of my best players, with whom I always enjoyed gaming, said that he isn't motivated to play a new game. When we got to discuss his decision, he told me he needs a strong sense of nostalgia in order to enjoy a game. He loved Star Wars because he grew up with it, and he loved Midnight because he has always been a big Tolkien fan. Personally, I still think he felt a little bit betrayed by my decision to ""kill"" the MN campaign, but he is a cool dude and he would never make a scene. I offered to DM any other game he and the rest of the group would like, as a parallel campaign to our Witcher game he did not join, but he seemed disisinterested at the time. Funny thing is, I was always confident that he would flourish under the Witcher system, and he would have loved it if he gave it a chance. He has always played characters who are socially adept and he is one hell of a roleplayer, with a great sense of humor.  

Finally, we agreed to play a Cyberpunk Red game when it is released.

Still, the whole situation reminded me why I love rpgs. Different people find different reasons to play and love this hobby. My friend mainly does it for nostalgia, and I believe I mainly do it to explore different themes with each different game. Themes, that create questions in my mind which I love to see answered by my players' choices.

Anyway, sorry for the long post and my poor english, it is something that I felt I wanted to express.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x295d4e7b0>,rpg,1573128951.0

14a2h61,Everything you need to know about designing RPG adventures: a cheat sheet,"How do you fill in the messy middle between worldbuilding and actually running the game? There are tons of books, blogs and videos tackling adventure design theory, but since RPG writers tend to be a little, uh, *verbose*, I started summarizing (and adapting) the advice that resonated with me the most. I consolidated those notes further into this system-agnostic cheat sheet.

I’m not claiming to be the expert here! The real experts (u/JustinAlexanderRPG, u/Mshea0001, u/mattcolville, etc.) are cited throughout if you want to read more. This reference guide has all the theory, advice and tools that help me prepare for the kinds of games I like to run (mostly low fantasy sandboxes), but of course there is no one correct way to design adventures and the advice here might not work for everyone.

# 📐 Structuring adventures

Adventures are single scenarios within the larger narrative of a campaign. Scenes (or nodes) are the basic building blocks of adventures \[[AG](https://theangrygm.com/between-adventure-and-encounter/)\]. An adventure’s structure determines how PCs advance from one scene (or node) to the next \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/15126/roleplaying-games/game-structures)\]. A single adventure may include overlapping, nested or blended structures \[[KO](https://knightattheopera.blogspot.com/2021/08/princess-mononoke-and-dm-prepared-plots.html?m=0)\].

**Procedural** structures encourage *emergent* narratives; require prepared *tools.*

* **Dungeon crawl:** Choose a doorway or room exit.
* **Hex/grid crawl:** Choose an adjacent hex/square.
* **Point crawl:** Choose a connected point of interest.
* **Node-based:** Collect clues that reveal connected nodes \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/45263/roleplaying-games/the-secret-life-of-nodes)\].

**Story-driven** structures encourage *directed* narratives; require prepared *plans*.

* **Linear:** Follow hooks to the next scene.
* **Branching:** Follow hooks to one of several possible scenes (often progressing to a single climax).
* **Mystery:** Collect clues that lead to the next scene.

Adventures should never have foregone conclusions. Even where the number of choices is limited, the players should still have *agency* (i.e., the feeling that their choices matter) \[[MC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqIZytzzFKU)\].

Making player choices *meaningful* requires sufficient context (information), viable alternatives (choice) and lasting consequences (impact) \[[CM](https://www.bastionland.com/2018/09/the-ici-doctrine-information-choice.html)\].

## Adventure templates

Generic structures for quickly outlining story-driven adventures.

## The Five-Room Dungeon [[JF](https://www.roleplayingtips.com/5-room-dungeons/)]

1. **Entrance:** Guardian or secret; reason why the dungeon is unexplored/unresolved.
2. **Obstacle:** Puzzle or roleplaying challenge; closes off the climax and/or reward.
3. **Setback:** Trap, trick or other unforeseen complication; foreshadows climax.
4. **Climax:** Central challenge of the dungeon.
5. **Reward:** Treasure, information and/or twist.

## The Five-Node Mystery [[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/37903/roleplaying-games/5-node-mystery)]

1. **Hook:** Introduction to the mystery; includes clues to each of the POIs.
2. **POIs (x3):** People and/or places related to the mystery; each includes clues to the other POIs and to the reveal.
3. **Reveal:** Ultimate answer to the mystery; often a confrontation.

## The Quest [[LK](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/102507/Situations-For-Tabletop-Roleplaying)]

1. **Hook:** Introduction to the situation; preparation for the journey.
2. **Acquisition:** Recovery of essential object or device. 
3. **Challenges:** Beginning of journey; predictable perils.
4. **Complications:** Continuation of journey with twist on the challenges; fallout from new information.
5. **Closure:** Delivery of object to final destination; reveal and aftermath.

# 🚀 Instigating adventures

Adventures are born from the movement of fronts (i.e., goal-oriented threats) \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/4147/roleplaying-games/dont-prep-plots)\] \[[PA](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html)\]. The PCs are drawn into and through adventures with hooks. Dynamic and engaging adventures occur at the intersection of multiple fronts and hooks \[[SR](http://rolltop-indigo.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-big-list-of-rpg-plots.html)\].

## Fronts

Dangers to the PCs and the things they care about \[[DW](https://www.dwsrd.org/gm/fronts.html)\]; advance independently of the PCs. Fronts comprise:

* **Linked threats:** Villains, hordes, organizations, cursed places, etc.
* **Goals:** Motivations or drives associated with each threat.
* **Timelines:** Sequences of consequences of each threat progressing toward its goal (i.e., countdown clocks); actions that trigger encounters \[[JF](https://www.roleplayingtips.com/rptn/how-to-spend-even-less-time-prepping-dynamic-campaigns/)\].
* **Stakes:** What we are playing to find out; open-ended questions about how the front will impact the PCs and/or the world.

Neutral or allied factions can function like fronts by replacing threats with *assets* \[[KC](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348809/Worlds-Without-Number-Free-Edition)\]. Simple threats require only a goal and a 3-step timeline \[[MS](https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/return-of-the-lazy-dungeon-master)\].

## Hooks

Dramatic challenges that the PCs are motivated to take on; primary adventure objectives \[[KC](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348809/Worlds-Without-Number-Free-Edition)\] \[[SR](http://rolltop-indigo.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-big-list-of-rpg-plots.html)\].

* **Combat:** Defeat, assassinate, interrupt or protect someone. Cleanse or defend somewhere. Destroy, neutralize or secure something.
* **Exploration:** Scout, navigate, infiltrate, escape, race or survive somewhere. Collect, steal, deliver, restore or activate something. Rescue, escort or track someone.
* **Investigation:** Discover, decipher, solve or locate something.
* **Social:** Persuade, deceive, intimidate or interrogate someone. Negotiate or administer something.

*Proactive* hooks come looking for the PCs; *reactive* hooks require proactive players to discover them \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/44541/roleplaying-games/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-scenario-hook)\].

# 🛠️ Preparing adventures

Prepared materials facilitate gameplay within an adventure structure.

**Tools** are materials that support procedural and/or improvised gameplay.

* **Maps:** Keyed \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/35180/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-the-key)\], rostered \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/38547/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-the-key-part-4-adversary-rosters)\] or blank.
* **Lists:** NPCs (names, descriptions, roles), locations (landmarks, settlements, taverns), etc.
* **Random tables:** Encounters \[[WS](https://www.prismaticwasteland.com/blog/hexcrawl-checklist-part-two)\], reactions, treasures, events, etc.
* **Stat blocks:** Monsters, NPCs, hazards, items, etc.
* **Clues:** Rumours, secrets \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/40978/roleplaying-games/random-gm-tip-using-revelation-lists)\], etc.
* **Timelines:** Calendars \[[WS](https://www.prismaticwasteland.com/blog/calendars-not-just-maps)\], countdown clocks, etc.

**Plans** are materials that support linear and/or directed gameplay.

* **Outlines:** Quest logs, scene summaries \[[AG](https://theangrygm.com/like-players-do/)\], flowcharts, etc.
* **Scripts:** Dialogue, exposition, cut scenes, etc.
* **Set pieces:** Encounters, puzzles, etc.

Flexible, reusable and/or impactful tools are more versatile and are often less work to prepare than unadaptable, excessive and/or redundant plans (i.e., scripted contingencies), even for story-driven adventures \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/37422/roleplaying-games/dont-prep-plots-tools-not-contingencies)\].

# 📋 Preparing sessions

Review checklist before each session \[[MS](https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/return-of-the-lazy-dungeon-master)\]. Skip steps addressed during adventure prep \[[MS](https://slyflourish.com/choosing_the_right_steps.html)\]. Recycle unused prep \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/39893/roleplaying-games/smart-prep-part-2-the-principles-of-smart-prep)\] \[[PA](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html)\].

1. **Review the characters:** What do the players care about? What is on the PCs’ current to-do list \[[AG](https://theangrygm.com/angry-open-world-lesson-three-part-one/)\]?
2. **Create a strong start:** Set the stage with action, roleplay or mystery. Drive the adventure forward by advancing fronts \[[DW](https://www.dwsrd.org/gm/fronts.html)\].
3. **Outline potential scenes:** Anticipate next steps for the PCs (1-2 scenes per hour of play).
4. **Define secrets and clues:** Discrete pieces of information not tied to any one source (10 total). Consider fronts, hooks, lore and PC backstories. For essential secrets (i.e., narrative chokepoints), provide at least three different clues \[[JA](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule)\].
5. **Develop interesting locations:** Evocative titles each with three unique aspects (1-2 locations per hour of play).
6. **Outline important NPCs:** Description (name, appearance), personality (archetype or quirk) and connection to the adventure (motivation or hook) \[[JF](https://www.roleplayingtips.com/rptn/the-3-line-npc-method-how-to-create-story-full-npcs-fast/)\].
7. **Choose relevant monsters:** Compile stat blocks and review abilities.
8. **Select rewards:** Treasure, magic items and/or secrets. Incorporate hooks for new adventures.

Where feasible, prepare high-impact extras (e.g., player-facing maps, handouts, images, music) for greater engagement.

adyc9b,How I gave up on being a great GM and decided to be a mediocre one,"I've been running games since 1990s. 

When I started as a teen, I did all the fumbling mistakes we all do. But I learned from them. I listened to my players. I learned to play them, give them the things they found fun. Then I learned how to open new vistas for them, how to lure people used to rollplaying D&D into roleplaying something completely different and so forth. During the years I moved from place to place and ran campaigns for dozens of groups. Players would design their weekly schedule around my games, so they'd make into them. Some players became fans, driving half a day to play in my games a couple of times a year. Some groups I still run games for occasionally like that. 

I used to make handouts and props. I'd write letters the characters received and roll them around in ash and water to make them puzzles in themselves. I'd draw maps and find pictures for all the NPCs, design soundtracks for each session. My campaigns would draw from the stories the players designed for their characters. There would be personal spotlights for each character and many times NPCs from their friends, families and enemies. Some plot arcs would take years in real time to mature... and so on and so on. 

All this consumed time, of course. 

I'd spend time and effort creating those items. I'd be thinkign about the campaign plots while in shower and exercising. I'd write them down in a cafe. That was okay though. I really liked seeing the wow-faces of players or hear them talk about my old games years later the same way people talk about their favorite movies. 

I don't do that anymore. 

I've given up on personal spotlights and character-based NPCs. I no longer spend time on handouts or other material. I don't spend time thinking how player actions affect the world at large. Instead I just write down the main core for a campaign and improvise the rest on the spot. I heavily plagiarise old RPG material I've read years ago or rerun old campaigns to new players. 

The reason is pretty simple. Players have become unreliable in their attendance lately. I don't know why, is it because of social media? Regardless of their status in life (children or lack of them, whether they work hard or not etc), they cancel at last minute or don't come to the session at all. I might expect five players, but only three come or the game gets cancelled two days before the agreed day. I don't think it is that I'd be running bad games suddenly; I've still received only praise and I still run games occasionally for people from my old groups. I'm still having fun, but... the difficulty of organizing games and the way people fade from them... it has killed my mood. 

So yeah, campaigns don't feel like worth it anymore. So I don't put in so many chips either. It is a shame. I miss running those really good campaigns. But I don't think it is worth it if the effort is not respected. 

It is not a question of having just a bad group either - I've noticed the same with three different groups during the last year, with a total of twelve players. 

Pardon me if this post seems egoistic. I just wanted to say it aloud somewhere anonymously, so I don't seem like I'm blaming my current players. RPGs are just a hobby, I get it. I don't expect people to put them first in their lives. But somehow, telling weeks ahead that you can't make it versus just not coming... those are so completely different to me and they've sapped my motivation.

n9dfe4,Would a system-agnostic book on how to make interesting and realistic cults be of value to anyone?,"EDIT: Ok I'm convinced, work on this book starts this week. 

A few years ago I realized I was born and raised inside a cult. In the process of leaving I've read a ton of information on how different cults operate, and how they are the same. I've been debating wiring a short book drawing from my experience and other sources on how to make cults more interesting and realistic. 

For example, many RPG cult members lead with their most insane doctrines. They may tell someone directly that they're going to sacrifice people to Cthulhu, and that's not generally how cults present themselves. Scientologists talk about mental health issues, not aliens. Mormons talk about family values, not getting a whole planet to yourself. Jehovah's Witnesses offer ""Home Bible Studies"", but don't lead by telling people Jehovah is going to kill them, etc. So a realistic RPG Cthulhu cult would talk about helping people live their life to the fullest (by killing themselves for Cthulhu). 

Anyway, just something I've been thinking about putting together. If there's any interest I'll make it a reality.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x295e58c20>,rpg,1620674058.0
f4a3c3,"A ""Brutalist"" Dungeon","A couple of weeks ago I posted this thread: [\[LINK\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/evld4u/tips_for_a_brutalist_dungeon/) to /r/dndnext and this post is a follow up to that - it went well over there, so I'm posting it here too to see if anyone here is interested. 

Something is in my world which is *so unnaturally abhorrent* that the world itself (called Gaia) has had a reaction to it, and formed a cocoon around it, like a pearl around a piece of grit in an oyster. My players are trying to get to the grit in the centre of this pearl, which means travelling through a structure with the following properties:

1. It’s not man-made, there does not *need* to be any way through it whatsoever. 
2. Because it wasn't ""built"", it doesn't need to accommodate a person’s passage through it, there aren't corridors, stairs, rooms. 
3. My players do need to pass through it somehow, it is a game after all. 

I wanted to create a feeling of otherworldliness, isolation and loneliness – like they are in a place which was not built for them, and in fact an architecture which passively rejects their presence – a sort of structural violence. The inspiration was heavily influenced by House of Leaves, and [Jacob Geller’s video on Brutalism and NaissanceE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkv6rVcKKg8). 

So, here is what I did: 
First off, features of the structure itself. The entire structure is built of a disorienting material, similar to [bismuth](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1tvoZqf5TBuNjSspmq6yDRVXa4/Bismuth-Crystals-100g-Bismuth-Metal-crystal.jpg) in that the surface reflects light in a curious shifting way. It is unlike any material they’ve ever seen before, and seems to have no particular beneficial properties (so there is not a particular compunction to hack at the wall with pick axes). 
They never found a “corridor”, they were always squeezing into cracks in a wall. Every crack snaked and shifted, at times they had to squeeze through spaces no wider than a foot, and at others the crack opened up into impossibly large chasms and open spaces. Like chambers in some great organ. Occasionally, to get through to another area, they had to pull away thin membranes of the crystal – like spun sugar. 

I created a D100 roll table:

* 1 - 5 – back to the start 
* 6 - 15 – a chamber (small) 
* 16 – 30 – a chamber (large) 
* 31 - 35 – a corridor 
* 36 - 50 – a vertical shaft
* 51 - 60 – a chasm (wide)
* 61 - 65 – a chasm (wide with “bridge”)
* 66 -70 – a chasm – narrow, no discernible exit on the opposing side.
* 71 - 80 – a slope (steep)
* 81 - 85 – a slope (gradual)
* 86 – 91 – solid wall blocks path.
* 92 – 99 – naturally formed stairs.
* 100 – a dead end, turn back.  

And each time they entered a new area they’d roll on the table. Ultimately, I had them roll twice on the table and they rolled a 65 (large chasm w/ “bridge”) and, curiously, 66 (narrow chasm, no discernible exit). This translated into two interesting encounters, connected by cracks in the structure and finally leading to my scripted room at the end:

1. The Large Chasm
2. The Narrow Chasm
3. The Abyss

**The Large Chasm - 65**

As they paw their way through a dark crack in the structure, the leading party member discovers that the floor they are walking on abruptly ends and drops into an impossible deep chasm. They are wearing a robe of eyes, which gives them darkvision of 120ft, so they can see an equally sheer wall 100ft across this abyss, they also spotted a narrow crack in the opposite wall some 50ft down and right from where they were. 

The roll table called for a “bridge” but I didn’t want to just give them one – so they had to investigate and found that there were crystals jutting out of the wall on their side which might be used as a makeshift stairs (if they began to traverse them they’d spot a number of structures they could use as a bridge). My intention was to have a few dicey dexterity checks, with perhaps some usage of ropes and pulleys, or someone to fly over and affix a rope they could swing across.  

But, of course, players are infinitely resourceful – and even though, at level 10, they’ve only got one player who can fly, they do have a wizard with Wall of Force. The walls are impassable, invisible and can be arranged however you like – so our wizard arranged them step-wise crossing the abyss. Of course, it was still unnerving to effectively step out into nothingness, and doubly so when you are standing on nothingness and you have to make a drop of several feet to the next invisible platform below. Our rogue marked the hard surfaces with a chalk, to help guide the way. 
Our Totem Barbarian communed with nature, connecting with the ley of this place – and found it to be entirely natural, but incredibly hostile. Like the structure itself was violent. 

**The Narrow Chasm – 66**

They spent another hour winding through the crack on the other side of the chasm, eventually reaching a point where it looked like a dead end. Approaching the dead end, however, they discovered that there was in effect a “crawl space” of about three feet down which they could shimmy the 150ft to the ground below. Our rogue (with Second Story Work) shimmied down and explored the surface, it was spiky – like the ends of the crystals were jutting through the ground, which made it difficult terrain. Not a problem if you made a save, but you’d prick yourself for 1d8 damage if not. The rogue explored the bottom of the chasm: to the left it abruptly ended with another sheer wall, but to the right the valley curved around a corner and seemed to narrow some 120ft ahead. I made them make a save as she stepped on a piece of uncertain ground and it gave way, revealing a deep dark shaft roughly 5ft across. She clambered back up to the rest of the party, and sent the Bard down into the newly discovered shaft to investigate through the use of Fly. 

**The Abyss (part 1)**

At the bottom of this new shaft was an opening into an impossibly large and impossibly dark space. No voice echoed in this chamber, and even with his dwarven dark vision – the bard couldn’t see any other surfaces save for the one through which he had just descended. Anyone falling down that shaft would drop out into pure pitch darkness, with no frame of reference, not even a surface to fall and die on – just nothing. He began to get twitchy, hanging in the darkness – like someone who had chiselled a hole in an ice layer, but was afraid he would lose track of the hole. He likened it to dropping into deep water, where you can’t tell which way is up and which way is down. He quickly flew back up the shaft and advised the party that it certainly wasn’t the way to go. 

**The Abyss (part 2)**

The party all clambered down the narrow chasm to the floor below (well, the bard failed the athletics check and fell – taking 41 damage on the spiked ground below, but that’s neither here nor there). They avoided the gaping opening down into the abyss, and continued on and into a crack in the wall beyond. Eventually this led to my final chamber of the pearl: a gigantic featureless room. 

**The Gigantic Featureless Room**

This is the room which almost broke my players, they’d been travelling in pitch blackness for the entire day. The environment offered absolutely no respite, there was no space to camp, no natural light, not even any hostile occupants – just silent, pitch blackness. And this is the state in which they entered the final test I had for them: 
A huge room with smooth flat floors, pitch blackness as far as even the most proficient dark vision user could see. They had a wall on their right, extending into the darkness, and the wall through which they’d entered which extended way to their left into similar darkness – and the intersection of these two walls at a corner nearby on their right. Bisecting these two walls, directly diagonal to them into the blackness was… nothing… just endless nothing. 

They surprised me by immediately striking out directly into the darkness. I’d envisaged they’d explore along the walls first, but they didn’t – they tied a rope to one person and then headed out into the darkness as far as their 50ft of rope would take them – then they saw what they could see. 

Nothing, of course. The room seemed to extend infinitely into the darkness. They sent out the warlock’s imp familiar, so a straight 10 minutes walking directly into the darkness, but he reported the same thing – just nothing, endless flat plane and darkness. From their point, on the end of the 50ft rope in the middle of this yawning room, they started to feel… unnerved. They all quickly agreed to follow one of the walls as far as they could. So they took the right hand wall and started to follow it – they walked and walked for hours, no change. They even marked the wall with chalk to make sure they weren’t walking in circles. Nope – it just seemed to extend into nothingness. The frustration seemed to be growing, so they decided to camp.

**Camping** 

I knew camping in this dungeon would be surreal. Particularly in this room. There are no features, no horizon to watch, no rocks to climb to get overwatch. The only thing a sentry could do is sit and stare endlessly into the darkness. Which is what they did – they set watches and, in turn, each sentry sat for a straight two hours staring into the darkness of the room. 
Another feature of this place was a persistent mechanical pulse which reverberated throughout the structure every 15 seconds – not noticeable unless you were looking out for it, but in the darkness of the “night” each sentry noticed it more clearly. What was an indistinct “pulse” before, now they attended to it, gained a vocal quality. What was a “HHMMMMMMMM” gained an “LLLLLLLLLLL” sound, and when one of the players critted their perception check I vocalised it fully…. “HEEEELLLLLLLLL”. And it was coming… from in the darkness. 

In the “morning” they rose from their slumber and what I had hoped would happen, happened. Some players were convinced they need to strike out into the darkness, some players thought they needed to spelunk into the shaft in the previous chamber, others thought they should just try to find their way out. Inevitably, an argument broke out. All the frustration, disturbance, isolation, of the previous day boiled over. 

I let them bicker for a good 10minutes (in game bickering, by the way, they were actually quite enjoying it). Eventually the “strike out into the darkness” crew won, and they began to, with great trepidation, head out away from the safety of the walls. 

**Into the Darkness**

Within minutes they were away from eyesight of the walls, and walking on a featureless pitch-black plane. I described how they walked for hours in pitch blackness, with no change. Again, they argued if they should turn back, or try to find a way to teleport out, but for now they persisted. 
Nearing the end of the second day in the darkness, they were not looking forward to camping in this darkness. Curious, the rogue dropped a ball bearing and noticed how it hit the floor and began to roll.  The floor was, perhaps unperceptively gradated – and every few hours she did the same thing, and eventually she noticed how the gradient was become more severe the further they walked. 

**Into the Abyss**

This is where I took over. It was late (in real life) and we needed to finish. I described how they reached a point where the slope was noticeable to everyone, they’d been walking for the entire day and had no true idea which way was “back”, the only thing they knew is that moving forward, if this trend continued, they’d slip and then… they’d fall. So, this was the test – this was the point of the entire room – are they brave enough to slip and fall? 

They were. They agreed to continue, and when the first person lost their footing and began to slide, they went with it. And when that sliding stopped being simply sliding and they fell out into pitch blackness – I ended the session, with the entire party dropping silently into the abyss. And we’ll pick it up again in two weeks.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x295e76a20>,rpg,1581776954.0

Divinity has so many character choices that affect RP-ing and how you interact with the world around you.

noegsn,Am I the asshole for canceling a session since players didn't read the rulebook?,"Were suppose to be starting a HERO system game today. While we ran some practice sessions I told my players to read the rules, especially when pertaining to how their powers work. I think it's been like over a month or so? Anyways Last night I asked if anyone had read the rules in preparation to which everyone had told me no. At that point, I kinda just canceled and said we'd play next week for everyone to read the rulebook. Am I in the wrong here?

Edit: I see a lot of suggestions for Session 0. I just want to say that not only did my group have a session 0 beforehand we had 2 both times I had told players to read the books and they agreed. My goal was to minimize early game woes by having to stop and explain rules en masse by having them read the book. That being said I can conclude that yes I was the asshole for canceling. The time spent in that session was time I could have spent just teaching them the mechanics instead. That being said a lot of you seem to be in the mindset that asking players to read rulebooks or just about *anything* outside of game time is unreasonable.

h93es4,"In a society where magic is present from the start, undead labor would likely be the norm, not the exception.","Assuming magic is relatively easy to learn, and a single necromancer can control a dozen or more skeletons, and a skeleton has high durability if not exposed to harm, I find highly likely that that would be the preferred form of labor.
Since the very start of life on Earth, obtaining food has been one of the most important (if not THE most important) driving forces towards progress, at an evolutionary and then societal level.
Now, imagine that to get food, all you had to do is animate some skeletons that have been lying around and order them to till the soil and plant seeds, at the cost of magical power. Settlements would form around fertile land as they have in our world, but society would center around necromancy, not phisical labour.
Populations would likely grow at a much slower rate, since there's less need for workers to feed the growing population.
Written language would be developed faster, because of the need to teach necromancy.
Necromancers would take most positions of leadership, and it's likely that religion would be centered on necromancy.
It would be seen not only as a force for good, but as the basis upon which the whole society is built on.
And that's only food - skeleton miners, woodcutters and any other form of labor that requires little decision making would be carried by undead workers, with humans keeping themselves to logistical functions, besides the necromancy.

Edit - Clarifying some points:
1. The preferred form of undead for most labor is the skeleton, because it lacks fleshy bits that rot and fall off. These skelies are animated by magic, not by binding spirits to them.
2. The morality of using undead would be defined by the societies that used them - which would likely see them in a positive light.

oui7rf,I hosted an RPG session for my parents. We ended after 25 minutes. They had fun though.,"_TLDR: I suggested playing RPGs to my parents during our vacation in the cabin. They never heard a word about RPGs, yet agreed to give it a try. Completely derailed from the story plot, yet they smiled afterwards, so I call it a success._

I play RPGs for years, mostly as DM. I also designed lots of small systems and yesterday I decided to present it to my parents. My SO was already asleep wit our kiddo, so it was only me and my parents sitting in the cabin, drinking wine and having a small talk. I wanted to avoid any kind of _high_ discussion (politics, neighbours, health, etc.) and as my dad doesn't like to play any games at all, I decided to present them roleplaying games. I wasn't putting any high hopes that they will actually say yes to that, yet they did and left me a little bit speechless. I was really pleasantly shocked and needed to make up a story for them.

I used my entrance-level homebrew system using a single 6-sided die, and prepared a low-fantasy setting story set in a small village that was preparing for a visit of a bishop. Every villager was participating, from the priest to the inkeeper, everybody was repairing their houses so they make good first impression.

My mum and dad were assigned roles of characters who immigrated few years ago, so they were already considered locals, yet with not very known past. My mum took a class of Knight and said that she was a sellsword in the past and my dad liked an idea of a monk focusing on a brewery (pretty interesting considering that my mother doesn't accept violence at all and my dad is 100 % abstinent for over 15 years). They were minding their business in front of the church when the priest opened the door and with the horror in his eyes told them that a blasphemy happened in the church.

They both walked inside, waiting for an explanation. A priest told them if they see something missing on the altar and they saw the giant cross is missing. _""Who would ever do that?!""_ the priest asked and the duo raised their shoulders. _""Could you, please, take a look for the church, while I try to look outside?""_ asked the priest and without waiting for their response disappeared outside, leaving them alone in the emptiness of the church.

As it was pretty late (IRL), I tried to be quite descriptive so they could spark their imagination. The knight decided to search the altar, to find anything else that could be missing. The roll was complete failure, so I told my mum that she really doesn't recall anything that she could ever saw earlier on the altar what could be missing right now. Then I turned to my dad, the monk, with raised eyebrows. He looked at me and with a stoic voice answered: _""Why should I bother to investigate some missing cross? I'm just a simple monk brewing a beer for our local community, we should call the militia to participate!""_ _""They seem to be pretty busy with other security-related preparations in your town,""_ I answered, but then my mum, ahem, a knight involved: _""Listen to this. I am going to the local carpenter and make it clear that we need new cross till tomorrow midday!""_ _""And I will try to finish my beer with my special ingredient to raise the diversion!""_ my dad joined the camouflage plan.

Let me say I am not used to railroad sessions and leave pretty much lots of space for players' creativity, but as I saw my ~players~ parents to derail completely, with a smile on my face I decided to end this intro. I asked them to roll so we can see how well they managed to fulfill their attempts. The monk failed miserably, so I interpreted it as he tried to make a new great beer flavor, but it was mediocre at best, but the knight succeeded largely. Therefore the carpenter provided an acceptable replacement of a cross before the bishop entered the city and the church was saved.

As usual, we had a small talk after the game ended. Mum & dad were confused why would anybody steal the cross, if there were certainly more valuable things to take. I suggested, maybe somebody wanted to profane the cross of the church, causing a big problems to the local people. They said _ah_ in unison and accepted that idea, but it was already too late and I ended the session by myself, so we decided to go to sleep. 

Still they joked about the session during this morning. My mum wanted to put something in the drawer, but the father was in her way, so she grumped: _move, monk!_

Me: “Yes.”

DM: “As you grab them, lightning surges around your body.  The daggers don’t seem to like you.”

I drop them.  The barbarian decides he wants to destroy them.  (In 1E, barbarians got tons of XP for destroying magic items)

Barbarian: “I’m going to just pick up ONE.”

DM: “Your alignment is chaotic good?”

Barbarian: “Yes.”

DM: “Are you SURE you want to do that, after seeing what happened to the paladin?”

Barbarian: “Yes.”

pbd5xv,"GM Experience should not be quantified simply by length of time. ""Been a GM for 20 years"" does not equal knowledge or skill.","An unpopular opinion but I really hate seeing people preface their opinions and statements with how many years they have been GMing. 

This goes both ways, a new GM with ""only 3 months of experience"" might have more knowledge about running an enjoyable game for a certain table than someone with ""40 years as a forever GM"".

It's great to be proud of playing games since you were 5 years old and considering that the start of your RPG experience but when it gets mentioned at the start of a reply all the time I simply roll my eyes, skim the advice and move on. The length of time you have been playing has very little bearing on whether or not your opinion is valid.

Everything is relative anyway. Your 12 year campaign that has seen players come and go with people you are already good friends with might not not be the best place to draw your conclusions from when someone asks about solving player buy-in problems with random strangers online for example.

There are so many different systems out there as well that your decade of experience running FATE might not hit the mark for someone looking for concrete examples to increase difficulty in their 5e game. Maybe it will, and announcing your expertise and familiarity with that system would give them a new perspective or something new to explore rather than simply acknowledging ""sage advice"" from someone who plays once a month with rotating GMs (""if we're lucky"").

There are so many factors and styles that I really don't see the point in quantifying how good of a GM you are or how much more valid your opinion is simply by however long you claim you've been GM.

6985rj,(Rant) I can almost guarantee I won't GM your combat-centric RPG if you don't offer this.,"A library of ready-made opponent stat blocks, **formatted for ease of play**.

* I have to build all my monsters/enemy soldiers/super villains from scratch? **Pass**.
* Your opponent stat blocks are in sprawling paragraph form in size 8 font? **Pass**.
* Your opponent stat blocks require me to cross reference to a huge library of powers, edges, or spells for rules text? **Pass**.

If you give me a choice between a monster book with 100 monsters in tight paragraph form with spell lists, or 75 monsters laid out nicely with critical stats highlighted and all ability text written out right in the stat block, I will take the latter every time.

Adding a monster/opponent to my session should be as simple as cracking the book and shouting, ""Roll for initiative!"" For all the complaints I had about D&D 4e, the one thing that edition did flawlessly was provide opponent information exactly as you'd want to see it in play, at the table.

Your opponent formatting isn't an afterthought. A stressed GM shouldn't have to retain the text of half a dozen spells or edges in-mind while trying to run an entertaining combat. They shouldn't have to spread sticky tabs through the manual to run all the rules widgets for one monster.

It boggles my mind that even some of today's most popular RPGs don't prioritize this.

3wymf3,The most insidiously meta rule I've ever encountered,"A friend and I were discussing odd, strange and nifty rules in games we've played and I recalled this gem from Mongoose's D20 Conan. I don't remember it verbatum so bear with me on my vague recollection.

D20 Conan had the same problem of linear fighter, exponential mage, that many D20 games (especially of the time) have. They came up with a very interesting, very thematic, solution.

To level up in the Scholar (caster) class one must succeed at some sort of check (the details escape me). It starts easy but gets harder with each level. The check is basically to see if you have in your travels uncovered some sort of inspiration to unlock the deeper mysteries of magic. IIRC it can be made easier by finding ancient spellbooks and the like. If you fail the check you reset your xp to the start of your current level. No level up for you, sorry.

""I know, it is *profoundly* unfair, but that's the way the rule is written, my hands are tied. All your friends are growing stronger, and you are left behind. You could always just abandon the path of magic next time you level, pick something easier... no?

Tell me more about how you worked hard for this new level. Tell me more about how you *deserve* it. Tell me more about how you *need* it to help your friends with the monsters they will surely face in the next adventure. Tell me about how much you were looking forward to, how much you *want* the *powers* the next level will bring. Tell me all your *frustrations and anger* about not being able to advance with the others.

It turns out... there is another way. A... creature, I do so hate the word ""demon,"" from another plane of existence whispers to you in your dreams. It will provide you the inspiration you seek to level up now, in exchange for a promise for some mundane task. Something truly trivial, no big deal. You'll also pick up a corruption point. It is true that in times of great stress or temptation I'll ask you to make a save against corruption. And if you fail one of these checks you turn to stage-villain evil, cackle off into the night and start a cult in a mountain of power. But, one corruption point, its so easy of a check. *You can handle it.* It is just *one.* It's just this one time, you'll be fine.

b11syu,HERE IS SOME FUCKING D&D: A Micro RPG In Four Pages,"**Edit:** When I made the clean version, taking out all the swears allowed me to make a more traditional ruleset due to the extra space. And though I didn't mean for the two versions to drift apart, they did a bit. This morning I updated the swear version to more closely resemble the clean version. Though there are still a couple tiny differences because, like I said, less room when you swear a lot.

Some time ago I came across HERE'S SOME FUCKIN' D&D, a micro RPG that's been floating around the internet for a number of years. In fact, [here's a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4066um/heres_some_fuckin_dd/) on Reddit about it from three years ago. I've run it a ton of times at bars, barbeques, picnics, and camping and I'm such a huge fan that I redid it and I'm releasing that effort to you all.

**The Story:** I love gaming at bars and micro RPGs work well in that setting. Unfortunately, I never really found a micro RPG that had the crunch vs. simplicity mix just right. Then a few years ago I came across HSFD&D, which comes *suuuper* close to the mix I want—but it had a few issues that bugged me. So I rebuilt the fucker in InDesign and fixed the shit that bugged me.

It's a *complete* overhaul of the original: I reordered and reworded things for better reference, rebalanced things (bards and halflings sucked in the original), used the original fonts from AD&D, made it so spellcasters could pick their own spells, redid the spells from the ground up using the same language style, added monster creation, monster examples, some magic items, hirelings, and then rounded the whole thing out with some random tables.

Also included is a clean version with all of the swears removed: perfect for teaching young children or priests. Put a copy of it inside a pencil box with some index cards, golf pencils, and dice and you have an RPG you can take anywhere.

Without further ado, I bring to you [HERE IS SOME FUCKING D&D](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SHJIvEn7Xyeot5Gmv6KmBAc7WgUVQxFM): A complete RPG in four pages; a marriage of 1st Edition and 5th Edition, powered by [whothefuckismydndcharacter.com](http://whothefuckismydndcharacter.com/).",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x297d59a00>,rpg,1552578020.0

xgpqaq,Looking to switch from 5e? Shadow of the Demon Lord does everything better. Here are the differences:,"Note: SotDL was written by one of the lead designers of 5e who felt that calling something “D&D” came with expectations, and therefore limited innovation. So, he made his own game!

1. Shadow of the Demon Lord’s rules are much more streamlined, while also allowing for more meaningful player choices. The big examples are listed below, but there’s tons of small quality of life changes you’ll find as you read through the rules.

2. The class system is far more customizable and easily the most exciting part of the system. 
    * You choose a novice path at level 1, an expert path at level 3, and a master path at level 7. 
    * The paths are all relatively balanced and have no prerequisites. So you could start as a rogue, but decide it makes sense for your character to branch into magic, and it would be viable.
    * There are tens of thousands of combinations in the core rulebook. (Tens of millions when you include all the additional content, seriously)
     * Instead of planning out your entire level progression on day 1 (and therefore ruining any meaningful choices later down the line), this system actively encourages choosing your build *as you define your character.*

3. Combat is way more interesting than just martials swinging their sword over and over and casters using the same spells over and over.
    * Martial characters get a shit ton of available maneuvers right off the bat, about as much as 5e’s battle master.
    * Casters get castings per spell instead of spell slots, so they can’t use the same spell over and over again. Instead, they’ll have to be creative and use their whole arsenal.

4. There are hundreds more spells in SotDL than in 5e, yet choosing spells is less overwhelming because of how they are categorized.
     * There are 30 spell traditions in the core rulebook. When you learn a new tradition, you are presented with a digestible amount of spells in the tradition that you can choose from. 

5. The system excels in fewer, but more dramatic combats, not like 5e where the system encourages having filler battles.

6. The initiative system is fast and innovative, but also adds another layer of thoughtfulness. 
    * Each round, players choose between taking a fast turn and a slow turn.
 Combat order goes: player fast turns -> monster fast turns -> player slow turns -> monster slow turns.
    * If you take a fast turn, you can either act or move, but not both.
    * If you take a slow turn, you can both act and move.
    * When you have dynamic battlefields where players have to constantly be moving and a GM who skips players if they take too long to decide what to do, this initiative variant truly shines in all it’s beautiful elegance.

7. Ability scores have been reworked to make more sense. 
    * The scores are now Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Willpower.
    * It’s incredibly easy to determine what actions/saving throws belong to which score. (Don’t tell me you understood the difference between wisdom and charisma saving throws!)

8. The boons/banes mechanic is more versatile than advantage/disadvantage and allows for stacking buffs/debuffs in a way that isn’t overpowering.
    * When you have a boon on a roll, you add a d6 to your d20. When you have a bane on a roll, you subtract a d6 from your d20.
    * When you have multiple boons/banes, you roll multiple dice and only use the highest result to add/subtract. 
    * Because of this mechanic, we can have things like crazy combat maneuvers while still accounting for their varying complexities.
    * Boons and banes also cancel each other out on a 1-1 basis. So if you have 2 boons and are attempting a 3 bane maneuver, overall it counts as 1 bane.

9. Instead of keeping track of a million little skill modifiers to represent your talents, you simply write down a profession from your characters background. Then, whenever that profession is relevant, you get a boon to your roll.
    * I could go on and on about how skill lists limit player options and creativity (especially since so many players treat the skill list as a verb list), but here, we have an elegant solution that *encourages* player creativity.

10. The corruption and insanity mechanics are great and can make for genuinely terrifying moments, but they can also easily be removed for a more lighthearted game.
    * Additionally, the paths/spells that actively corrupt you / make you insane are thematically awesome.

11. Character creation is lightning fast. You choose your ancestry and professions, roll for equipment, and then you’re good to go!
    * I don’t think people always realize how important fast character creation is. When I show up to play an RPG, I want to actually *play* the RPG, not wait until the next week.

12. (Ok, this point isn’t related to 5e but I wanted to mention it in case people were concerned.) As far as lore goes, it’s purposefully light and flexible so that GMs have full reign to make the world their own.
    * Or, you can use a completely different setting with pretty much no hassle. The mechanics are not tied to the initial setting.
    * But if you really like SotDL’s lore and want more, plenty of supplements exist that flesh out areas for you.
    * It’s a win no matter what type of GM you are.

So there you have it, I believe that Shadow of the Demon Lord does 5e better than 5e. You can get a free starter guide [here](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/156576), it’s everything you need to play at level 0.

Update: [I wrote a buyer’s guide for those interested in the game](https://www.reddit.com/r/shadowofthedemonlord/comments/xqxleq/shadow_of_the_demon_lord_buyers_guide_supplement/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29912d220>,rpg,1663429184.0

Thanks!

\---

Moral “alignment” is a common trope in RPGs, be it fantasy or otherwise. The most simple presentation being a choice between good and evil with stoic neutrality in between the two extremes. Another axis - like adherence to the rule of law versus spontaneous chaos - was added to make characters more two-dimensional. Not all characters needed to be hand-wringing evildoers or cat saving boy scouts.

Although, even with the two-track approach, options are limited. The other problem with this type of black and white morality is that it doesn’t speak to *why* a character is “good” or “evil”. **Master of the Rogue Spire** presents a more piecemeal approach to personality generation for players and Game Masters. Those familiar with the traditional nine alignments will be able to find some overlap in the new system, but there is much more room for customization and experimentation in your character’s Personality Traits.

## PERSONALITY TRAITS

When deciding a character’s personality, players and Game Masters should think of what motivates their character into action or inaction. Below, **Chart 5.1** shows the relationship of the 10 general personality traits. They form a circular pattern from altruistic motivations to dominant motivations and back around again. Altruistic characters take action selflessly, while dominant characters focus more on what they can gain from each situation.

One the left side of the Personality Wheel are personalities focused on individual action while the right side is more motivated by social structure. Traditionally, this was called the axis of chaos versus law, but while chaos implies randomness, those motivated by their individual wants may be very focused and organized.

[Chart 5.1: The Personality Wheel](https://i.imgur.com/XvE42ym.png)

## CHOOSING TRAITS

Characters can have up to four different personality traits, but most have only one or two. After choosing an initial trait, remove all opposing traits - these are traits more than three spaces away on the Personality Wheel. Opposing traits may be admissible by your Game Master, but **a character cannot have two diametrically opposing traits** as they stand for the exact opposite motivation. These diametrically opposing traits are highlighted in *italics* in the Trait descriptions.

Characters can be motivated by something other than what their Personality Traits dictate, but the traits should take precedence in any important decisions that have real repercussions in your game world.

>**RANDOM TRAITS FOR NPCs**If a player or the Game Master wants to quickly determine traits, they may roll for 1-4 random traits for each character:

1. Roll 4d10 and place them in a row.2. Record the Trait selected by the first die number.3. Remove all dice with opposing Trait numbers.4. Remove the first die. If any dice remain, go to step 2.5. Repeat until no dice remain.

## ENCOURAGING ACTIONS

Game Masters should keep track of a player’s traits and have them available during gameplay. If a player is making a tough choice with two wildly different outcomes, there are benefits they can be given for choosing the outcome that coincides with their character’s motivations. At the appropriate decision point, adjudicated by the Game Master, they may gain the Encouraged status. This can be a personal decision or a decision that the entire party makes. In the case of a party decision, the Game Master may give multiple characters the Encouraged status for the same action.

A Selfless character could be encouraged if he stayed an extra day in town to heal the sick even though a storm is coming, an Independent character could be encouraged to disobey the direct orders of his leader because he saw an interesting shop on the street, or an Imperious character could be encouraged by forcing his way into a leadership role in his gang over someone that better deserved it. Characters need to make an actual choice to receive the Encouraged status, which usually means facing some repercussions.

If a player already has the Encouraged status, they may choose to spend the new Encouraged status at that moment or lose it forever. If a player has the Discouraged status they remove it instead of gaining the Encouraged status, or if applicable, downgrade Stressed to Discouraged or downgrade Overwhelmed to Stressed.

## DISCOURAGING ACTIONS

When players go against their character’s motivations, the Game Master may give their character the Discouraged status to represent the regret they are feeling. Characters can also be affected negatively by the actions of the other members of their party. If someone in their party makes a decision that is diametrically opposed to their personal beliefs, the Game Master may give the Discouraged status to any characters that were aware of the action happening and could have stopped it. If a character has the Discouraged status, they upgrade it to the Stressed status, and if they already have the Stressed status they upgrade it to the Overwhelmed status.

>\*\*DEGRADING STATUS ORDER:\*\*DISCOURAGED -> STRESSED -> OVERWHELMED  
>  
>More information will be provided in later content.

A Dogmatic character would be Discouraged when another party member steals from the inn where they are staying, a humane character would be Discouraged when another party member tortures a captive orc, or a Righteous character would be Discouraged when the party decides not to intervene when the town is being unfairly punished by their leaders. A Game Master cannot bar a player from taking an action opposed to their Personality Traits, but players that continue to take Discouraging actions should be allowed to change their character’s Personality Traits.

## NPC REACTIONS

NPCs that already have the Discouraged or Stressed status will refuse to take another action against their beliefs and can be further discouraged by the actions of their group if their happiness is not managed. NPCs that have the Overwhelmed status will immediately leave the party if they deem it safe to do so. Once they have left the party, they will not return without some intervention from the players to explain their actions or how they have changed.

## CHANGING TRAITS

Changing Personality Traits should not be done on a whim, but if a player is consistently being discouraged by their own actions or by their party, they may petition the Game Master to change their traits. If done in the first few sessions of play, there should be no problems switching out traits - the purpose of the traits is to give the players a basis for their role-playing decisions and reduce table arguments over character motivations, not to punish players for trying to refine their character's personality during play.

If a penalty for changing traits is needed to reduce players taking advantage of the Personality Trait system, Game Masters may give the Discouraged, Stressed or Overwhelmed status to characters that change Personality too drastically or too often. They may also bar a character from getting XP for the next session to represent the stress of their character's emotional upheaval.

## TRAIT DESCRIPTIONS

## 1. CRUEL

**Motivation:** Malice

**Motto:** “Show no mercy”

**Opposing Traits:** (6) *Humane,* (7) Selfless, (5) Principled 

Cruel characters take great pleasure in hurting or dominating others, especially their enemies. They may extract a steep penalty for any wrongdoing or serve a cruel master, but they aren’t concerned about helping anyone or progressing the greater good through their cruelty.

* They want to hurt others.
* They would only show mercy to inflict more pain.

## 2. IMPERIOUS

**Motivation:** Power

**Motto:** “Might makes right”

**Opposing Traits:** (7) *Selfless,* (8) Righteous, (6) Humane

Imperious characters wish to take power over others and feel no need to help other characters whether they are in trouble or not. They may use their power to progress the greater good, but they are not concerned about the well-being of individuals other than themselves or the idea of justice unless it is what they justly deserve.

* They want to dominate others.
* They would only help someone to gain power over them.

## 3. DOGMATIC

**Motivation:** Order

**Motto:** “The law is the law”

**Opposing Traits:** (8) *Righteous,* (9) Independent, (7) Selfless

Dogmatic characters follow the law to the letter, whether it be the law of the land or their religion or their group’s ethos, but never their own personal whims. They may be ambitious for status and wealth or kind to the unfortunate but they do not seek out independence in action or desire to give their life in service.

* They want to follow the rules.
* They would only do what is right if the law allows it.

## 4. OBEDIENT

**Motivation:** Duty

**Motto:** “Just following orders”

**Opposing Traits:** (9) *Independent,* (8) Righteous, (10) Ambitious

Obedient characters follow the orders of their commanders, whether they be good, evil, legal or illegal. They may serve selflessly or as an extension of their personal cruelty, but they aren’t concerned with their personal ambitions or what is the just course of action in any situation.

* They want to serve their leader well.
* They would only do what they want if their leader allows it.

## 5. PRINCIPLED

**Motivation:** Unity

**Motto:** “For the greater good”

**Opposing Traits:** (10) *Ambitious,* (9) Independent, (1) Cruel

Principled characters try to do the best for all, even if would cause suffering for some - some would call it the pragmatic side of good. They may try to consolidate power around themselves to do this or have their own sense of right and wrong, but they not driven by selfish or cruel motivations.

* They want to make the world a better place.
* They would only act for themselves if society would benefit.

## 6. HUMANE

**Motivation:** Altruism

**Motto:** “Kindness is never wasted”

**Opposing Traits:** (1) *Cruel*, (10) Ambitious, (2) Imperious

Human characters are always kind and never cruel, even to their enemies. Their kindness does not have an agenda. They may take personal joy from kindness or it may be part of a deeply held belief system, but they don’t care about status, competition, or hierarchical dominance.

* They want to be good to others.
* They would only hurt someone if it can not be avoided.

## 7. SELFLESS

**Motivation:** Service

**Motto:** “Living is service to others”

**Opposing Traits:** (2) *Imperious*, (1) Cruel, (3) Dogmatic

Selfless characters live in service to helping others even if it may be detrimental to themselves. They are independent agents serving causes that they believe to be just and good. They may blindly follow the orders of a just leader or seek to gain prestige and fame for their service, but they don’t enjoy cruelty or following rules they believe to be unjust.

* They want to serve the cause.
* They would only take power over another to save them.

## 8. RIGHTEOUS

**Motivation:** Justice

**Motto:** “More justice, less law""

**Opposing Traits:** (3) *Dogmatic*, (2) Imperious, (4) Obedient

Righteous characters do what they think is fair and just and are not concerned with what the law says they can or cannot do. They may fight for the greater good or enjoy handing out cruel punishments, but they are not interested in power for power’s sake or following their leaders blindly.

* They want to right wrongs.
* They would only follow the law if they agreed it was just.

## 9. INDEPENDENT

**Motivation:** Freedom

**Motto:** “Live in the moment”

**Opposing Traits:** (4) *Obedient*, (3) Dogmatic, (5) Principled

Independent characters do what they want to do and are not concerned about what others think. They may thirst for power or do good for others, but they care nothing for the rules of society or a nebulous sense of the “the greater good.”

* They want to enjoy life.
* They would only follow orders that they wanted to follow.

## 10. AMBITIOUS

**Motivation:** Achievement

**Motto:** “First come, first serve”

**Opposing Traits:** (5) *Principled*, (4) Obedient, (6) Humane

Ambitious characters want to be the best, the richest, the most loved or if they cannot be any of those, simply be most famous. They may get there while slavishly following the rules or through heroic self-sacrifice, but they are not concerned with being nice or following the will of others.

* They want to improve their holdings and status.
* They would only help others if it helped them personally.

So they check out the right hand wall, one of them tries an awareness check, another tries to search for traps. for those kinds of checks, I roll behind the screen, so I just tell them they find nothing (not quite the same as telling them there's nothing there) One tries detect magic, passes and learns there's nothing magical about this wall. The dwarf gets out his axe and batters the wall with the blunt side. He shatters a brick but just reveals more stone behind it. One of them thinks about using an xray vision spell but decides to save her magic points for later.

So having done all the reasonable checks, tried a few things and failed to discover the hidden secret in the wall, they carry on towards the door at the other side of the room, and one of them falls right into the pit trap the arrow was telling them to avoid.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x299608950>,rpg,1548592104.0

103dyos,There’s always been a GM shortage,"There have been rumblings online of a dungeon master shortage that will spell the doom of D&D and RPGs in general. The stir seems to have been mainly caused by [this article](https://hellgatenyc.com/no-on-wants-to-dungeon-master-any-more). Others jumped in, and Questing Beast [made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr5gtvvkTe4) about it. I even wrote up some [quick thoughts](https://www.dicegeeks.com/dnd-in-a-dungeon-master-crisis-game-master-shortage-is-not-new/).

I think those discussions are missing some key points, but first, let me tell you a story...

A conspiratorial glance in English class. A hasty whisper in Study Hall. A slyly passed note in Introduction to Earth Science. “A guy at a different high school wants to run D&D.”

What happened next? Eight hours spent making (completely wrong I'm sure) a wood elf ranger named Arenoth. Thanking God I bought that 1970 Firebird from my brother’s ex-girlfriend after it had been totaled. It should have been able to make it 12 miles to the kid’s house.

What didn’t happen next? The session. A father’s business trip. A sister's cheer tournament. Some of the other players decided it was easier to play Super Mario Brothers than to figure out a ride. Whatever it was, the session didn’t happen.

What did I do? I went back to running WEG Star Wars for my friends and GMed everything for the next 20 some years until one of my players finally decided to run a game (after non-stop begging from me).

The hot take here is that it was easier back in the day when the glories of the OSR were blooming like the fresh flowers of spring to run games, so we had more DMs. Not true.

When a session began at the entrance to a dungeon, and there was no outside world and characters were easy to make and had no backstories, still hardly anyone wanted to the DM.

Why, you say, why? Because it's more work than being a player. The DM needed monsters, and room items. They needed dungeon maps. They needed to know the rules because the players didn't own the books (or had never heard of an RPG before) and couldn't look them up online. Plus only one of the players actually wanted to play. The other three people were strongarmed into playing by the DM filled with dreams wafting from the pages of Dragon magazine of mythical things called campaigns.

You see, there's always been a GM shortage. It is just the nature of the hobby. Being GM or DM takes more work than being a player, so fewer want to do it. Though, it doesn't take as much work as some would like to say it does.

But it's gotten worse for DMs since then. Now, we place so much pressure on the GM that is a surprise anyone wants to run a game. Just look around the web.

Bad game mastering turns off players. GMs have to cater to every whim of the players. GMs have to know every single rule. If they don't know how to run mounted combat they've failed and should be cast into the lake of fire. GMs need to spend hours each week planning sessions. GMs need to write epic campaigns the likes of Tolkien or Shakespeare couldn't produce. Bad D&D is worse than no D&D.

Lies, lies, all lies from the pit of the nine hells. Hot take: If you want your DM to be Shakespeare, you had better be Michael Caine, Patrick Stewart, or Maggie Smith.

However, there is another truth at the heart of the matter. While there is a GM shortage, and there always will be, there are currently more game masters than ever before.

In the last seven years, I have only GMed when I wanted to. All of the players in my group now regularly run D&D or another game for our group and even for other groups. The popularity of 5e caused more people than ever to take up the mantle of the dungeon master. Hop on Roll20 any day or time and you can be in a D&D session in less than 15 minutes.

We should stop complaining and realize we are in the Second Golden Age of RPGs. More people are playing and running than ever before in history. Let that sink in, and think about what it means for the future of the hobby.

Soon D&D will go into a downturn like all the cycles of the past. The players 5e brought in will play other RPGs, and the hobby will move a little less mainstream until D&D makes another resurgence. But the end result will be a thriving hobby with many more people willing to run games.

Let's encourage new role-players to run sessions, not berate them if they don't know a rule. Let's encourage players to learn how their characters work and to be active and helpful.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29ab5b1d0>,rpg,1672863899.0
kd1nnw,"Please, give your GM a break.","Sorry if this  is kind of ranty, but I have to get this off my chest.

I have been playing Table Top RPGs for close to 20 years and primarily GM a number of different systems. I ran our normal online 5e session with our normal group and a newcomer that a player invited with my approval. Last session was the first time in my entire GMing career in which I had a player (the new one) treat me and the session like a ""commodity"", ""product"" or ""transaction"" as opposed to a collection of friends enjoying each other's company and playing a game. As a GM, I failed  to meet this player's unstated expectations, norms, and sensibilities which I read all about in a rejection letter of de-constructive criticisms.

I am not upset that this player doesn't want to play our game. Part of the beauty of Table Top RPGs is that there are so many different systems, styles of play, optional rules, homebrew rules, tones, and themes. There is a game out there for everyone, though it may be difficult to find. I totally get it, this wasn't the type of game for this player and have had players back out many times in the past. What bothers me was that in running my normal campaign, I was made to feel as though I failed this player. I was made to feel that I didn't provide the product which I advertised despite never meeting this player before. I wasn't treated as a person that has my own interests and makes my own mistakes or misjudgements, but a means to an ends. The ends, in this case, being some nebulous version of ""fun"".

So please, if you are a player who is sitting in on a game that isn't fun or has problems, by all means bring it to the attention to the GM and even back out of the group if you want. But please remember, your GM is a person with their own schedules, limitations, anxieties, insecurities, interests, and methods of doing things. The GM isn't always in control of the campaign or session (which can be a ton of fun, but can be a nightmare), or the GM can be experimenting with some ideas, or the GM can be having an off day. Please don't take it personally. Your GM probably isn't trying to keep you from having a less than stellar time. But don't be cruel just because an itch wasn't scratched (especially if you didn't make that itch known). If you are at a table and find yourself not having a blast, try to enjoy the company of the people playing around you (to include the GM). Nobody at the table exists to ensure that you have fun. It is OK to just play the game to melt away a few hours but enjoy being with friends or potential new friends.

So please, give your GM a break. They may be a narrator in what has to be the most complected genera of board games ever, but they are still very much a human being at a table.

&#x200B;

EDIT & UPDATE

Wow, this blew up a bit bigger than I expected. I cant say enough how thankful for all your encouragement and input. Honestly, I am thrilled with how healthy the tabletop community can actually be and it was nice to be reminded of that. I wanted to respond to everyone, but sadly, work today is turning out to be a bit busier than a typical Monday. Addtionally, people have been wanting to know what happened specifically, when I would be willing to post, but don't really have time right now. I am open to doing so later. 

I must admit, I was kind of vague about details because I don't really want the discussion to turn to, ""you did this wrong,"" or ""next time do this."" I recognize that there were strengths and weaknesses of my last session. I have been experiments a bit more when I play 5e lately, so I fully acknowledge that I made some mistakes and I totally own them. My overall message is that it is OK for a GM to make mistakes, have a bad session, or do things you don't like as a player. As a player, you should communicate your concerns and even quite the campaign, but not be petty, rude, or de-constructive with your criticism. 

That being said, I would be open to telling the full story because I do think it can be something that players and GMs can learn from. So hopefully I will get time later. 

In the meantime, here are some key takeaways. 

For players. GMing is a difficult job and which is made even more stressful because their isn't a right way to do it. Sure, GMs can get overly defensive, but a lot of GMs put a lot of themselves out there. This is very often true when you are having a blast, but also true when you aren't feeling it. By all means, be critical, but make sure your criticism is fair, tactful, and constructive. Also, please be open to an explanation for why a GM may have made the decisions that they did and be willing to be part of the solution. I misread players all the time. This can be even more difficult with role-playing since the actions and attitudes of the character may not match up with those of the payer. So please, be mindful that the GM is probably trying everything they can to run a fun and rewarding experience. Please be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and to give them a break. 

For GMs, especially new GMs. You can be doing this hobby for 20 years and still make mistakes and not have all the answers. I am nervous before every session, without fail. Additionally, even after 20 years you can be still trying to improve your skills and become a better GM. Lately I have been racking my brain on how to better introduce and run villains and I agonize how to pace a session, especially an online session. Not being able to read the room makes it so hard to pace a session and get it to move smoothly. With all this in mind, if you are a GM, be open to feedback (both positive and negative, so long as it is respectful) and be willing to give yourself a break. You should be having fun too. 

For everyone. You are sitting down to play a game with acquaintances, friends, or potential friends. My group is made up of players from all over the world and it is an amazing opportunity to learn about other people, their views, and their experiences. Even if you aren't having a great time GMing or playing, try and cherish the opportunity to totally lose track of time by just having a silly conversation about the lifestyles of elves and gnomes.

3x3p7g,The Best Advice I've Ever Gotten for Running Games,"One of the handiest tips I've come across for DMing games is something I like to call ""The Four Whats"" though it has an optional 5th one for linking quests. Essentially, when you are making a quest you apply these 4-5 questions to the base concept (""go kill goblins"", ""find the orb"", etc). Not only can it help you check for plot holes; but it can turn mundane side quests into fully fleshed out ones with little effort. The optional 5th one can even aid in creating an entire campaign if an earlier one didn't do it.


The Four Whats:

- What are the quest giver's motivations?
- What are the bad guy's motivations?
- What are the quest giver's sources for his information?
- What reason would the players have to accept the quest?


Optional 5th: What are the sources for the bad guys' information?


For example, let's run a simple quest through this: ""Bart wants you to go to this cave and kill some zombies.""


- Bart is a paladin that crusades against undead.
- The zombies are there because a necromancer found a powerful necrotic wand there and set up a base there.
- Bart knows about the zombies there because he was defeated and badly wounded trying to stop them.
- He will pay them, and helping a paladin might put them in good with his order.
- Optionally, the necromancer may have heard tale of the wand from a local bard... but where did that person hear of it? Plot thread!


With ease the process turned a mundane quest of a generic person sending you to kill generic enemies into a quest to redeem the honor of a defeated paladin and stop a necromancer from using a fell wand to threaten the nearby town. Two possibly recurring NPCs (ally and villain) plus a bit of loot or plot macguffin were also introduced, with the fifth what giving another thread to follow up with.


Post applying these I also like adding four secrets to discover. Either hidden loot or just interesting baubles or bits of the past. Let's add these to the example for seasoning.


Four Secrets:

- One of the zombies has a key to something that is elsewhere.
- In a side passage two lovers have been slain who were hiding there until nightfall so they could flee town. Seems they were killed before the necromancer got there.
- In a pool of water the party finds some gold dust.
- The necromancer dropped his pocket watch in a side room. On it is an engraving that hints that he was once very different, but the party may not figure out it is the necromancer's.


And there we have it. Quite the fleshed out quest from basically nothing and pretty easily done. Though this might be an obvious process for some I just thought I'd share it for those it might help.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29abd3560>,rpg,1450287346.0

c2idk9,Fill a Town with 4-Sentence NPCs!,"A while back, I did this thing on Facebook, where I invited my friends to create characters to populate a small town. It was real simple -- you just had to define a few things about them, and that was it. It was formatted like this:

1. **Character's Name** - something appropriate to a small midwestern town ca. 1953 [or whatever setting - that was just my mood that day]
2. **Role In Town** - What the person does from day to day, be it  a job, a cliche, or whatever
3. **A Brief Description** - Just a few words about the character's personality, background, what have you.
4. **Dramatic Question** - An open-ended question that suggests a mystery to solve, a conflict to play out, or a secret to discover

Here are a few examples. Note that the implied setting was a small midwestern town in the early 1950s and with a touch of emerging weirdness, but that's the least important part of this tool.

&nbsp;

> Archibald ""Ace"" Dudley, Greaser. Shiftless Layabout, The Usual Suspect. How did he get a talking motorcycle?

&nbsp;

> Frank Pendleton, runs Pendleton's Beauty Shop on 3rd Ave. Confirmed Bachelor, Musical Theatre Expert. What'd he do in the war to get all those medals?

&nbsp;

> Father Thomas O'Hanrahan, local presbytarian minister and war veteran, served as a chaplain on D-Day. Quiet, kind affable, well respected in the community. Why is there only one crucifix in the church, and why does Father O'Hanrahan have to undrape it before mass every Sunday morning? And since when was Jesus crucified with a purple blindfold over his eyes?

&nbsp;

>Dottie Perkins, Waitress at Mel's. Too Smart For A Small Town Like This One, On A First-Name Basis With Everyone In Town. What future year was she ACTUALLY born, and how does she hide  from the townsfolk the fact that she's a time traveler?

&nbsp;

>Thomas Hameln von Koppelberg, heir to the von Koppelberg mining fortune. Amateur & self proclaimed town historian & genealogist. Obsessive collector of old and obscure books; particularly of histories, and atlases.  •Only in his early 40s, but seems much much older, as if time had worn harder on him, prompting many to wonder if they know his real age. Pays his workers well, but has unusual business habits. Why did he unexpectedly close his most productive mine, build a heavy locked door and barricade across the entrance, and then move all the miners to multiple less viable shafts?

&nbsp;

>Emerson Rankins. He works as a private accountant, mostly doing taxes for folks around town. He showed up 4 years ago and moved into the abandoned Rankins house behind Zip's. He had the deed, and the key. He seems to know as much about town as Mr. von Koppelberg, who avoids him at all costs. How did he have the deed to a house that was empty for 40 years?

ejjgtp,"I'm a bit sick of the false dichotomy of ""combat vs RP"".","Now, this is not to say that combat can't be a drag or that it can't be completely disengaged from the story. It can, and, most of the time it is.

But here's the kicker.

That's the DM's fault, that's OUR fault, (and, in part, the Three Pillar's fault, but we'll get to that).

Now, what do I mean by it's our fault? Well, let's take a step back.

Raise you hand if you've ever seen Star Wars, Episode I and Star Wars, Episode IV. Now, people always blab on about how Episode I is boring (it is) and Episode IV being the shit (which it is). But, compare the action between the two of them. Which one has more action? Episode I. Then, why is it that the movie with less action is, in this apparent paradox, more entertaining?

Well, if this was an RPG, we would be quick to say,  ""See?! Combat is boring! Give me a non-combat RPG any day!"". But that I'm here to make the case that this reasoning is completely flawed. The problem, the issue, lies elswhere.

The issue, my friends, [as a famous serial killer, kidnapper and reviewer extraordinaire once said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHUj90XDYE0), is that you don't give a shit to what happens to Qui Gon, Amidala and all the other clowns. You don't care about them or that planet, or who the fuck Darth Maul is because you, as an audience, doesn't know them, and, more importantly, *the characters, the actual characters in the story, don't interact with Maul other than to fight him*. Yeah, the visuals in the scene are ok, the choreography is good, but, ultimately, the scene leaves you... eh... alright, they killed the BBEG of the week, but... what about it?

Compare to what happens in Episode IV. The lightsaber fight there is between an actor who, at the time of recording, was in his 60's and a guy in a rubber suit that could barely move and much less see. But that fight bears more significance, more emotional charge than two guys fighting a double-bladed lightsaber in a reactor core while flashing lights are going on.

Now, You could still say ""hey, right, but, then you need to take time away from action to invest in the characters, see? Less combat is good.""

Now, pump your brakes, kids, we're not finished with Star Wars.

Episode VI.

Episode VI is almost pure action. Starts with a failed heist, an action scene in the desert. In the end, we have, at the same time, a Battle in the woods, a space clash and a fight between father and son, all culminating in a space station 160 km wide being destroyed, the carebears defeating the empire and Darth Vader YEETing emperor palpatine out the goddam window, with luke helping him escape. There is some interaction inbetween scenes, yes, and there are some powerful scenes in those interactions, but the action scenes are the most memorable. Now, again, we cared about those people involved in the fight, and we cared about the outcome of those, we understood what was at stake, so we were invested.

Now, let's go back to RPGs in general. Let's focus of a typical culprit of ""combat is boring"". Let's take a look at D&D/Pathfinder.

*So, you guys have entered the jungle plains of Galgathor, in search for the fabled ruins of the Dragon City of Valnaxar. You fo to sleep at night \*DM Rolls dice, looks at random encounter table for his humid jungle CR5 list\* and you are attacked by a group of... uh... giant... centipedes. Ok, roll initiative.*

Now, does that sound entertaining? Well, mechanically, maybe, if the DM knows how to handle a multitudinous enemy, and if, maybe, the ranger can use his favored terrain/favored enemy, and clumped enemies means more opportunities for AoE attacks from the wizard. Neato, right?

But, what does this fight tell us about the mission, the plot, the characters, the country? Anything? Will the characters be the same after this fight? Will the mission have advanced? Would it have been any different the morning after if the characters hadn't fought at all? No, not at all. Then, why have the fight there? Why not postpone the battle until there is something interesting, or something that is relevant? 

Consider the same example, characters exploring a city, and a large group of CR 1/2 enemies. Ok, but now, let's make it kobolds (more fitting, kobolds, dragons, you know), and now, let's make it so that some of them are wearing an oversized piece of armor or weaponry with the emblem of Quixulan, the ruling noble house of Valnaxar. Shit, suddenly, those kobolds tell us something about this country, about Valnaxar, about the mission. Now, let's make it so that they are speaking in draconian, and they are saying things like ""Death to the invaders! Let the earth of Valnaxar feast upon the blood of the unworthy!"" Now, they may not know draconian, but they might recognize Valnaxar amongst what they are saying.

Ok, so, in the previous example, it was all flavor, and that's a good starting point, but now, let's do something CRA-ZY, let's involve the *mechanichs* into the *storytelling*. We have a conflict here, which is the prime material for drama, or RP, as we call it, and yes, we don't know much about these kobolds, but the characterse might want to know more. ""Where did they get their armor and weapons? How did they find out about Valnaxar? Are they original residents that just endured over time or are they new inhabitants?"" To answer these questions, the players have a number of options: they can capture one alive and see what they can gather from him. They might want to route them, and then follow them through the jungle, or they might just kill them and follow their trails back from where they came, or a myriad of other things that they might think of.

Now, how do we involve the mechanics in the RP? Well, if they want to capture one, maybe the kobolds know this, and, like many people, know that if they are captured, a fate worse than death might await them, or that a comrade captured puts the location of the city at risk, so instead, they outright kill themselves/their companions before being captured. This might not need a new outlandish thing, but a simple drank poison, or the other kobolds attacking their fallen brethren until they are sure it's dead. And about their combat tactics, kobolds are a great example of how combat can define a character or a society, how the RP, the worldbuilding, can inform the mechanics, and vice-versa. Kobolds are small and fragile, that's why, against a group of adventurers, they will probably use guerilla tactics, specially when they know the terrain, and the party doesn't.

Now, let's take this characterization of combat a bit further. Consider another scenario. The typical bandit/thief attack in the middle of a city. Tried, grinded, boring. Yes, I admit it. Why? It's a bunch of low-level npcs that pose no threat to the party whatsoever. It's an opportunity to roll some dice at best, a nuisance at wrost.

Now, remember when I talked about star wars. Remember I said that all fights had meaning, because we cared about the results and the characters. Does that mean we cared about the rancor? Well, certainly not, but we cared about Luke making it out alive of that pit, and, more importantly, we bought that a guy like Jabba the Hutt would have a Rancor-Pit-Of-Death right under his throne, because he's a slimy guy like that.

So, with that in mind, let's take the previous bandit attack on a city^(TM) and let's turn it into something interesting. Let's say the BBEG that they guys are following is a secretive wizard, that has been plotting in the dark, and no-one know its true identity. They don't even know their true motivations. But they have a lead on a guy that might now something about someone who might know this wizard. It's a far-fetched thing, but, hey, it's a lead. So they go visit him, an interaction ensues, and the bloke flees the scene, leaving his low-level henchmen behind as he makes a run for it.

Notice, his low-level henchmen are, exactly, the same low-level henchmen as before, they are going to die as easily as before, perhaps 3-4 turns tops. Problem is, now there is a rush, because the more time they spend with these bozos, the more time the lead has to escape. Now, the monk might make a run for it, but it will also mean that he's alone, against him, and that guy might not want anything to do with a party of 5 adventurers, but he might be experienced enough to take this one guy out, specially if he has a backup group waiting for him. The fighter and the rogue might not spend as much time flanking and sneak attacking if they have to rush it, etc.

And as such, there are plenty of examples, Why did the usually calm and protective paladin NPC? rush through enemies, risking attacks of opportunity, when she saw that particular guy behind the enemy lines? Why does the Toreador primogen have Protean claws? etc.

tl;dr: What I'm getting as with such a long post is that combat and RP aren't mutually exclusive, but rather, they stand in a dialectical relationship. One informs the other, and vice versa. Combat can BE RP.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29b056c60>,rpg,1578076158.0

6us2fp,A Eulogy for My Group,"*TL;DR: I had an amazing gaming group and I want to offer remembrance for them.*

**The backstory:** I am a Franciscan friar -- meaning Roman Catholic, I live like a monk but instead of being in a single monastery for my whole life, I move around.  I'm now moving from one friary into another. At my last friary, three of us friars would gather at least weekly for a role-playing game (a homebrewed Tunnels and Trolls campaign, for the curious).  I'd frequent various Reddit subs for advice.  It wasn't until this week, where I attended my first Adventurer's League game at a game shop, that I realized just how special my group was, which has inspired me to immortalize my group by sharing with this sub the joys that we had.

**The game:** Living in a friary is literally the BEST place to do role-playing. It's an entire house filled with multiclassed cleric-monks. We're already walking around wearing robes, looking like it's the Middle Ages, plus we've got access to everything from the church -- candles, incense, ancient-looking books. Hence, when we did our games, we went all-freaking-out.  

We were all new to tabletop role-playing, but we got into our characters and soon an elven wizard looking to bring his friend from the dead had struck an uneasy and eventually trusting friendship with a thieving fairy, and the adventures were on! Among my favorite moments were the following:

* The introduction of an NPC panther to the party, who could communicate to the others by changing his color (later revealed to have been a wizard who stayed polymorphed too long and only had that  one last transmutation trick left).

* The taming of a warg -- it took a long time, but once tamed, the elf rode the warg and the fairy rode the panther.

* A pair of bounty hunters, who, rather than being killed, were beaten into submission, tied to a tree, and forcibly sent on a vision quest using psychedelic mushrooms and poetry to the wizard's deity.

* Sneaking around a mansion, trying to go undetected using fly and invisibility spells, with both running out at exactly the most tense moment.

**The extras:** The game itself was great, but only half the fun. Our environment kicked ass. We had music, atmospheric lighting, location-appropriate decorations (including ashes and bones when they were clearing out an undead-infested temple), and even used homemade incense when receiving oracles from a visionary witch. And here, check out our [game board.](http://i.imgur.com/WoFpRmZ.jpg) Those candles are homemade jar candles with wax melted down from old altar candles. The red bottle in the front left? That's a home-made health potion (drink it whenever your character does.) It was a guava/hibiscus/paprika potion, and the color was on-freaking-point.

Oh, and the food. We took our Saturday afternoons to prepare for the evening's game session. We're talking homemade curries, quiches, cheesecakes, cheese plates -- we even had bacon-wrapped dates once! And those bottles towards the back of the picture were soda water which we'd mix with homemade syrups to make homemade sodas when we didn't have a beer or wine handy. Every week was a new and unique drink. Ever tried white chocolate soda? I have. Thanks to my players' creativity, we tried it and loved it. Between the food, the environment, and the role-playing, everybody put in a ton of effort to make each game session memorable.

It lasted a year. I thought I'd be there longer, but I was moved. And I'm not only sad to leave, but I really miss those nights with the guys and will probably never have a table quite like it.

So, to my gaming brothers: I miss you, and thank you so much for making that year so memorable.

*Sadly necessary addendum:* In case there are any Christian readers who might be scandalized to know that friars game: we have fun. It's a human need. You like us Franciscans because we're happy people. It's inexpensive entertainment, it brings us together, and I could write a whole treatise on why role-playing games can contribute powerfully to ethical formation. And no, playing the game didn't cause us to get possessed by demons. No matter how hard we tried. ;)

Anyways, thanks Reddit for reading. If you see an excitable friar at a gaming shop who really likes RPGing and isn't cosplaying, come on over and say hi cuz there's a good chance it's me. :)

d6dcxa,Forbidden Lands Core Game FREE for one-day (DriveThruRPG),"https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/258593/Forbidden-Lands-Core-Game

So FriaLigan is celebrating their Forbidden Lands: Bitter Reach expansion kickstarter launch and they just Tweeted out that they're giving out the Core Game of Forbidden Lands for Free for one day only.

I've ran a few sessions so far with my group and we all completely fell in love with it. We all started from Pathfinder, into D&D 5E and this game is a nice departure from it.

You get the Gamemaster book, Player manual, Legends and Adventurers Booklet, and the Hex Grid Map.

The game's already a steal of a deal in terms of price to content so it being free is pretty great.

~~That being said I am not sure on if it's the updated version? We recently got access to the next ""printing"" in PDF form which had some updated rules. I'm not sure if DriveThru's version is up to date. Either way highly recommend.~~ This is the latest version too! 2nd Printing has some updated rules that were just recently implemented.

If you have any questions about the game I'd be happy to answer! I've not done a super deep dive into anything but from the few sessions I've run I've got a decent handle on things. This is definitely a game I hope more people check out!

EDIT: Now that the event is coming to an end, here's the kickstarter for The Bitter Reach: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/forbidden-lands-the-bitter-reach-campaign-and-reprint?ref=nav_search&result=project&term=forbidden%20Lands",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29b1d3fe0>,rpg,1568896291.0
1cnc7vw,"Remember, Session Zero only works if you actually communicate to each other like an adult. ","Yeah, yeah, this *should* be obvious, but right now I'm watching five months of investment in a campaign implode because people at the table agreed to a session zero, sat down, and then failed to fully voice their expectations and boundaries for the game. I reserve the right to vent a bit.

When our group sat down for our preliminary session of *Monster of the Week*, I walked away feeling like I'd hosted the ideal setup. MotW is a game where character creation is also worldbuilding, so players are effectively building out the campaign from first principles at the same time they're building out their characters. It's the ideal time to nip any concerns about content in the bud. I printed off a common safety checklist, we went around the table doing our Lines & Veils, and we had an open discussion about what we wanted the campaign to be about; on paper, we did everything you're supposed to do.

One of the playbooks in MotW is ""The Monstrous,"" a character born of the campaign's main chosen monster-faction but currently rebelling against their kind. One player quickly settled on playing a vampire-spawn hunting her own kind, and took the ability to mentally dominate humans as a starting ability. She wanted to play a character who struggled a bit with her own toxic impulses and the ease with which she could manipulate other people, because she was interested in playing the kind of character at serious risk of eventually becoming a Keeper-controlled threat, as is one of the fates that can befall The Monstrous as a playbook. As a full group, we discussed our level of comfort with these themes, revisiting our Lines and Veils to discuss how far we were willing to let this go in-game. We set our hard lines, we all agreed emotional abuse was not a line or veil; to reiterate, *we did everything you're supposed to do*.

Except, I guess we didn't. Five months later, eighteen sessions deep, midway through an adventure partially concerned with either freeing the Monstrous character from her curse or losing her to bestial hunger, another player has said OOC they don't want the character on their team anymore. She's crossed too many lines, used too many people; in their opinion, it's deeply uncomfortable that we're discussing redemption for this kind of character at all.

And I'll admit that I'd noticed the friction once or twice before now. Long, quiet streaks after scenes where the Monstrous used her powers to flippantly command civilians, and especially after scenes where she'd use this power on another player who played her partner to shut down arguments (with both players' full consent in playing out a toxic relationship). It's why I'd reached out to this player, repeatedly, checking in to make sure everything happening in the game was okay with them. I was told yes. Now I'm being told no, it's been upsetting them more and more for months, and they aren't having fun playing as a character who would associate with this other PC. In fact, the whole concept has been upsetting them from the start.

Why wasn't this brought up during session zero, when everyone was invited to set their boundaries for the game? *""Because everyone else seemed so excited about the idea,""* so they didn't want to rock the boat.

And I guess... I don't know. I don't know what I could have done differently. I sat everyone down, asked them to discuss what they were comfortable with playing, invited them to reach out in private for anything they felt uncomfortable disclosing in front of the group, and blatantly had that ignored until it festered into a problem beyond salvaging. Everyone is angry at each other now, and losing either player is going to take at least one other player with them, killing the whole game dead in the water.

I get that there's a lot of social awkwardness in this hobby, but what's even the point of building such a culture around safety tools if players are going to be too conflict-averse to use them? We had every chance to solve this five months ago, on the ground floor, before we'd invested all this time into a story at least one player quietly resented the whole time.

gr2zr9,"Unpopular Opinion: I Buy Games For Mechanics, Not Atmosphere and Lore","I've had a lot of discussions recently regarding what makes someone love a game, and a majority of the time people say that it's the lore, the setting, the atmosphere, and similar aspects that makes them fall in love with a game. Mechanics are a secondary concern more often than not, and a lot of players are more than willing to put up with sloppy, confusing, or messy mechanics if they love the look and feel of the game's world.

I'm on the exact opposite end of this spectrum.

Don't misunderstand me, I am here to tell interesting stories in fun settings. However, spinning story and making a setting is something I can do on my own if I have to. That sort of surface-level stuff is a snap of the fingers. Making a game that functions at a mechanical level, that's balanced, fair, and which isn't going to make me re-write half the rule book for it to actually work, though, is not my strong suit.

On the one hand we all agree there's a lot of room under this big gaming tent that we're all hanging out in. It takes all sorts, and everyone is free to like what makes their game nights better. On the other hand, it's important to know where other gamers are coming from when they talk about games they love. Because one gamer's feature is another gamer's flaw, so it's not enough to know *that* someone loves a particular game... you need to know *why* they love it so you can judge if it's going to be a game that you will also enjoy.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29b364a70>,rpg,1590518940.0

12vcxn6,"Does anyone else do the ""Zelda thing"" for character and place names?","So, coming up with good names can be difficult. I also happen to be rather picky on that kind of stuff, which means that I often feel a bit restricted when I need a lot of different names. The solution I have found to this issue is simply to reuse names from previous games. At first, I was only doing it sparingly, and only with different players but, as I kept doing it, I realised that it could also be a fun little narrative device for me to play with the players' expectations, *Commedia dell'arte*\-style. 

So what I do now is that I willingly reuse place and character names for ones that have some parallels from one game to the other. For example, I've included a couple shaman/witch characters all named Ruhi, or multiple great cities (usually with some connection to the divine) named Alhandra. I've found that players usually enjoy this type of thing because it makes them feel like they know the world, but without the spoilery part (since each iteration of a name is at least a little different from the previous one).

dbaz5r,Death by Debt at TSR,"In April of 1996, Random House sued TSR for lack of payment on a $9.5 million loan.

You may ask yourself how TSR came to owe its distributor such a large sum of money. The answer lies in the 1979 distribution agreement between Random House and TSR, in which Random House became TSR's exclusive avenue into the book trade. In that agreement, signed by Gygax himself, Random House agreed to advance TSR 27.3% of the retail value of their product upon receipt. Random House could also return the product to TSR for a refund. All this meant that TSR could produce cash by shipping to Random House instead of waiting for actual customers to purchase their products.

The arrangement seems bizarre, but Jim Fallone, a TSR alum familiar with the agreement, said there may be an excellent reason for it. TSR's books were beautiful, and therefore expensive. Also, TSR had a back catalog that sold well. Sometimes, TSR faced a choice between printing new material, and reprinting old material that sold well, but might take time to make a return on printing costs. The Random House agreement was a way around this problem. TSR could print and ship new copies of the *Player's Handbook* knowing that they would get paid for it soon, and then also afford to print new material.

According to Fallone, the math on all this works out fine, so long as no more than 20% of TSR's products are returned. But in the 90's, TSR's many forays into creating new game worlds increased their levels of returns to more like 30%. At the same time, TSR began overprinting products. *DragonStrike*, for example, was a hit game that was driven into the red by overprinting. The game sold 100,000 copies, and had reorders for 50,000 more. Management, however, decided to print 150,000 copies of the game, which never sold.

Also, TSR began to use Random House to generate ready cash. Fallone said that TSR began to “abuse the loan aspect of the contract by shipping product to Random House that there is no actual sales demand for just to generate the advance payment in order to cover printing debts then you pour gasoline on the fire.""

These practices helped cause TSR's near bankruptcy in 1997.

If you're interested, I talk to TSR alums Jim Lowder and John Rateliff [here](http://plotpoints.libsyn.com/death-by-debt-at-tsr-ep-161) about the contract.

od2afo,"So I accidentally convinced my players of an Illuminati style conspiracy, and I’m not sure what to do about it.","Just doing a few oneshots for a bit, and for fun, made my own list of random encounters for when they’re traveling. Nothing ridiculous, just stuff like bandits, random traders, a wagon train of people, etc…

I made it so one of the players got to roll percentage dice to determine their random encounters so they felt like they were involved, and everything was working fine, until they rolled a joke encounter I made that was the only 1% chance, the next lowest being 9%, followed by the rest all being 10%. 

This one percent encounter was they come across a campfire just off the road, and if they sneak up to it, which they did successfully, they would hear talking. 

Well, our rogue who had dark vision, which I forgot about, snuck up close enough, and saw the talking was coming from a set of 6 mimics, all in chest forms, speaking common, and talking about business dealings they had, at one point, without thinking, I said one of them mentioned a monopoly. 

The joke was going to be they would hear the talking, but once they got close enough, the mimics would clam up, and never speak again. When confronted, they would offer silent trades like little vending machines, by showing a treasure item in their mouth, and waiting for the players to make an offer. 

I’d had mimics act like simple, and sometimes fun little traders before so this wouldn’t be new for the players, but I’d established that mimics couldn’t verbally communicate.

I forgot the rogue could see them clear as day in the dark, so they didn’t get close enough for the mimics to notice him, but he could clearly see their lids flapping as they talked.

The group retreated, and chatted about this, and I immediately realized my problem when they mentioned the Illuminati. 

My players are now convinced there’s an Illuminati style group made up exclusively by mimics, controlling multiple trade monopolies like a council of business villains.

Luckily it was getting late anyway, so I managed to stop the session after they set up shifts to watch the camp from a distance, and plan on following them when they leave.

So now I have the party convinced a group of joke mimics are somehow evil business masterminds, and they plan on following them at the start of next session.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29b4b8380>,rpg,1625332856.0

rchu00,Your Expectations Are Too High,"And too specific.  


One of the things I see in this and other rpg related subreddits is many GMs -- mostly new, but sometimes old hands as well -- presenting campaigns they intend to run with way too specific and high expectations. I want to explain why that is, in my opinion, the wrong way to go into a game.  


First of all, there's an old adage (tat I think is Buddhist but I can't recall): All unhappiness is the result of unmet expectations. This is as true of an rpg campaign as it is of meal at a new restaurant or a bad commute. Having an image in your mind of how the game is going to unfold, how cool the epic moments are going to be, and how immersed your players are going to be in the story all invite disappointment.  


Beyond that basic problem with expectation in all walks of life, rpgs have something special about them no other form of entertainment does, or even can: uncertainty is built into the form as a major feature. Not knowing where ""the story"" is going is the point. Not knowing which NPCs will be important, which PCs will live past the first session, what plot threads get pulled, and so on are all important aspects of play that make the thing work as a whole.  


It's the difference between world building and campaign building. The former can create a sense of depth that really immerses the participants and allows the GM to respond with consistent and agile improvisation. The latter can make players feel railroaded and lock out opportunities that would otherwise have been awesome.  


If you are spending a long time crafting a ""story"" before the players hit the table, ask yourself why. What are you trying to accomplish? Are you setting up yourself for disappointment when the players inevitably disrupt or, worse, ignore your carefully crafted narrative? Are you trying to show the players how great a storyteller you are, instead of helping them show one another how great a story they can create together?  


None of this is to say you have to start a campaign blind. (I mean, you can, and I think everyone should try it once just to experience what a truly beautiful chaotic mess it can be.) But instead of deciding how it is going to go, just set up the situation and have a solid idea of what would happen if the PCs did not get involved. Then let them loose on the setting and situation and see what happens. Allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised by their strange choices and the unexpected fallout from die rolls.

ecat7a,"Unpopular opinion: RPGs with ""easy to learn"" rules are actually not beginner-friendly.","_TL;DR: Having more rules helps unexperienced players and GMs to deal with uncommon/unexpected situations. Therefore so-called beginner friendly systems are often not very beginner friendly._

&nbsp;

First of all I should mention that I don't have a ton of RPG experience. I've only played/mastered 5 different systems now. The one that I played (and GM'ed) the most is called ""Aborea"". It is a German system that is marketed as very beginner-friendly.

&nbsp;

Getting more and more into different RPG systems, I feel like it was a mistake to spend so much time with Aborea. The ""easier"" rules of Aborea often times led to situations being unclear, searching for a possible rule or discussing the (rather short) rulebook. Being an unexperienced GM, I was forced to improvise a lot or to tell my players that some actions didn't have an effect because there was no rule for it.

Example: The players manage to set an enemy on fire, but there is no rule for the damage dealt by this action. Now the GM either has to improvise (by considering an appropriate amount of damage that the fire deals) or has to claim that it has no effect.

&nbsp;

We are preparing for a ""Das Schwarze Auge"" (I think it's ""The Dark Eye"" in english) campaign at the moment. While being the most popular system in Germany, DSA is said to be not very beginner-friendly.

Getting into DSA though, it actually seems easier to play (and master), _because_ there are more rules. It feels like there is a rule for everything, nothing remains unclear. You sure have to look up many things, but the detailed rules (and lore) can provide more solutions for uncommon situations/decisions. This certainty can help unexperienced GMs.

&nbsp;

So, in my opinion, RPGs with fewer/""easier"" rules should not necessarily be described as beginner friendly. It could even be reversed, like less rules = more experience needed. Am I totally wrong here?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29bb37860>,rpg,1576664424.0
1ocl0e,Overheard my students roleplaying,"I was on a bus with my students, doing some grading when I over heard them talking excitedly about a troll. I knew all 4 8th graders pretty well and none of them had ever shown up to my weekly Science Fiction club that I put on for the kids. So, I listened in.

It would seem that they had created a role playing game all of their own, with no prior knowledge of D&D. Each had a character and they would describe their actions. The person on the left would describe what was going on and what they were fighting.

If you got into a fight, you flipped a coin. If it came up heads, you won. If it came up tails, the group decided your punishment. There was no central GM and the group was having a blast playing. I listened to them for about an hour as they described moving through a dungeon to get treasure, grinning the whole time. I was impressed with them.

np4c5p,What overused trope in RPGs do you still enjoy no matter what?,"I thought about this recently and even after 15 years in the hobby, I always enjoy a good **Sewer crawl** in my game either as a GM or as a player.

Be it in sci-fi or fantasy games, there is always so much to do in a game with sewers and I'm not even talking about fighting dire rats.  


* **Bandits**. You find locals trafficking or hiding stashes of loot down there, black market and escape routes. Perfect way to find the literal underworld from your city;
* **Methane pockets**. Careful where you bring that torch, keep track of the air stench even through all this foul smell;
* **Disease**. Such a wonderful to scare players of even more experience. Any open wounds could result in longer term consequences to deal with;
* **Mutated monsters**. The weird discarded things people just throw down their toilets is enough to create a bunch of monsters with unexpected variation type. What about a two-headed crocodile instead of a regular one?
* **Mushrooms and fungi**. You can find some rare and poisonous growth there that could make any dire exploration even more disastrous. Hallucinations are no joke;
* **Undead**. Mix monsters with fungi and you got yourself a nice recipe for a walking parasite that reproduce by murdering people and  getting spores into open wounds to repopulate.

There are a lot more things you can do with sewers such as dumping lore about the city or what is being hidden from the people here. The claustrophobia of the environment + the danger of the darkness and murky water + the constant threat of disease and longer terms penalty for a mistake always make for tense sessions.

It's like walking next to lava but that could bring a slower and more painful death. Also it's easier to access in most campaign than a volcano.

Anyway, as I was thinking about that I thought that more people probably have some tropes they enjoy and put some twist on to keep fresh or something and I might as well ask to get some ideas for later date right?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29bd75c40>,rpg,1622470371.0

1fbklo7,I think I realized why I don’t want to play D&D anymore,"It’s the fucking D20 dice mechanic. 

I’m 47 and have been playing since AD&D. But I’ve found myself in a situation where I feel like I have to min max my D&D characters for them to be fun. 

When I roll up a fighter, I have to optimize every weapon, feat, and subclass for combat because 1)it’s such a huge part of the game and 2)even if your character is reasonably good at something, the d20 is so swingy that unless you’re TEH BEST you have these feel bad moments where your supposedly capable character comes off feeble because of the dice. 

Those kind of ridiculous failures then make it hard to pursue the narrative ideas I have under-pinning the character.

To get around this I find myself playing characters with more open-ended abilities. Mask of Many Faces and minor illusion come to mind because they allow so much consistency and flexibility. But why can’t I have that kind of open-endedness or expect that kind of internal consistency with all classes?

I might try the whole “roll 3d20, choose the middle value” approach to kill some of that swingy-ness. Draw Steel seems interesting because of the 2d10 roll mechanic. 

I’d love to play D&D, but that just kills it for me. Any other alternatives?

Edit: First off, thank you everyone for such an amazing discussion. There are discussions around everything from dice mechanics to DM style to whether I secretly love min-maxing. 

This topic seems to be a Rorschach test of some sorts and that’s fair because the topic goes beyond just the dice roll. The reason I love this hobby is because it’s personal. It’s so innately human and everyone has brought that fully to this discussion. Thank you. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29c961b50>,rpg,1725752884.0

9jvttp,Never put a Brothel in an adventure.,"Story time. So me and about 5 or 6 of my friends we like to make our own P&P adventures. Its really fun, the GM gets to be creative and watch how others tear down his perfect story. This is exactly like that.   


The start of the story was that our group was supposed to save the daughter of a millionaire. There was a certain terrorist organisation who could've kidnapped her. So me and my team, being a human detective, an elf healer, a human wizard and someone you could describe like an ork but stronger and even more stupid and one dwarven technician. So we went into a tavern and got a lead, that maybe the local Brothel could have some ladies who know about the terrorist group, since they were known to hang out at such shady places.

&#x200B;

 So our group went to the Brothel (I don't know any other word for brothel other than whorehouse, so I'll just keep on writing Brothel)  and started searching for clues. The Healer and wizard both went searching for some hidden passages/doors where some could possibly hide. The dwarf went ahead and got himself a lady and the detective (me) wanted to talk to a ""lady or the evening"". So she took me in a room where we talked about the terrorist group and what maybe going on in the Brothel, since the workers just disappeared. This is where it gets funny.  


I realized that I didn't have any money on me. The prostitute wanted some money though, which is why I, backed up into a corner by my own stupidity, decided that killing the prostitute who was actually made a pretty nice character wasn't the worst choice. Wrong.  


So I went ahead and, did that. I got a malus on every single aspect of my character. Meanwhile my friends found stairs leading to a dungeon of sorts, lots of closed and empty cells, much like in a prison.  


So I decided to tell the boss that her worker would be downstairs shortly with the money I gave her. Yikes.   


The GM trying to make this a good round, punished me by making me forget to clean my hands. So I stood in front of her with blood all over my Hands. Instantly ran downstairs where we killed about 4 bouncers from the Brothel. 2 of them, we found out later by the GM, weren't supposed to be killed. Then the dungeon got infiltrated by Guards with man-high shields. Obviously Guards from the City, who were there to arrest us, and once again, to not die at our hands.  


There were a total of 6 Guards, everyone died because of us. They had awful throws after awful throws, while we were getting quite lucky. The Ork just straight up Ran into the first 3 Guards and killed them almost immediately while the rest were on the other 3. It was a disaster, from a moral point of view. We ended up fleeing the Brothel while we were chased by a magician who told us that we could run but never hide. When our group came to the realization what just happened, we agreed to join the terrorist organisation because apparently we are the bad guys now.  


TL;DR: My group went into a brothel the good guys and ended up joining a terrorist organisation and were wanted state wide because I was too stupid to pay a hooker.

i7f8tp,How I Turned a PC Into a Pig and Handled Them Being Happy About It,"Context: I'm running a homebrew system/setting about students studying to become licensed adventurers. During their final exam for their first semester, they came across a boss inspired by ""The Wolf"" character from fairy tales, One of the signature moves of the boss was them turning to a PC and shouting ""RUN! RUN LITTLE PIGGY!"" forcing them to make a very high save DC or be turned into a pig for 1 hour. I intended this to be a hard debuff, something they'd have to play around, but something that would go away after the climax of the adventure concluded. After an extremely close fight, they ended up winning with the PC (now a Pig) landing the killing blow. We ran out of time and the session was over. But I had a new problem.

In the post-session chats it became clear that the player turned into a pig was super excited about the role playing challenge of being a Pig, especially since he was transformed while none of the other PCs could see it happen, and the players were spending time talking trying to figure out how long the curse would last, how they would break it, how they'd figure out the Pig was their classmate etc. I only intended this to last 1 hour, and break on its own, but considering all the excitement in the team around this, I felt that starting the next session by informing them that the PC turned back into a human during a short rest would be very disappointing to my players. However, I wasn't prepared for having the PC be stuck as a pig for an extended period of time, and furthermore didn't want to penalize the player for being interested in the role-playing opportunity by upgrading the curse to a permanent curse.

So at the start of the session I asked the PC controlling the pig how their character felt about being a pig, what the internal monologue was about. The response was ""at first it was inconvenient, but now I see it comes with advantages. For the first time in my life I can eat whatever I want and people think it's cute not disgusting."" I told them to tell me if that inner monologue changed. The idea being, if it did, and he resisted, that he would turn back into human, though I didn't communicate this to the players. We then played out the rest of the adventure with the party finally learning that the pig was their classmate, navigating back out of the enchanted forest to the exam entrance, and rolling a random encounter against... boars and the PC using his new pig form to successfully negotiate safe passage through their territory using their animal handling skill and a large supply of extra rations.

After finishing the exam, the player eventually sought out the Druid Professor specializing in Beast Forms. In this meeting he learned that the curse had mostly expired and that if he wished to return to being a human he need only see himself as a human, but once that happened he would no longer be able to be a pig. Unless he signed up for his class of course. 

We then spent some remaining end of semester downtime with the character as a pig, until a random event happened with him reporting to the kitchen to serve time for his work study with the cooks, and the ogre chef saw this pig, not recognizing it as the character, and tried to capture him and berated him for making a mess of his kitchen. This insulted the character, since he had earlier earned the title of ""Award Winning Chef"" for winning the school festival cooking competition, and in thinking of himself as the Award Winning Chef, the PC narrated his character turning back into a human, much to the shock of the Ogre Chef. 

So instead of getting a combat debuff, I ended up with some fantastic story beats that would never have happened otherwise. 

Anyway, thank you for attending my story time. Do any of you have related stories of throw away debuffs turning into minor or major plot points in your games? How did you handle it?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29caa47d0>,rpg,1597098522.0

aiwm7o,Potentially unpopular opinion: I'm getting real tired of RPG Kickstarters becoming years-long tales of woe,"I've backed a lot of RPG crowdfunding projects, and I've noticed some trends in fulfillment. Some are like clockwork; other creators just vanish. Some produce great stuff; others deliver crap. I accept the risks inherent in the platform and do not get unduly worked up about these results.

Some take forever, but there's an explanation like ""the first layout guy bailed on me and the second layout guy has apparently disappeared."" I like having those updates, and don't mind waiting. Many of the other backers agree; I frequently see things like ""hey I'm willing to wait but please tell me what's going on.""

But lately I'm getting these multi-page messages like ""well I've gotten divorced and I'm living out of my car and my children have disowned me"" and okay, yes, you should let us know about delays, but it's getting so in many cases I'd actually rather not get the product than have to receive these dreary-ass updates in my email.

One project just sent out this incredibly detailed report, written for the creator by a friend of the family, of the creator's life-destroying illness and increasingly desperate financial situation and ended with some plea for patience while he somehow wills the physical product into existence despite being in an iron lung or something, and, like, can you we maybe take about 15-20% off there, super chief? I mean partly I resent this one in particular because I backed it entirely out of pity; he went on a bunch of podcasts and was like ""I JUST REALLY WANT TO BE A GAME DESIGNER LIKE MY FRIENDS"" and like *minutes* after the campaign ended the delays began and now it's turned into this giant thing. Ugh.

And yes, I can unsubscribe from updates, but it's starting to feel pervasive. I'm getting to the point where I have to decide if I want to be part of someone's shoulder to cry on when I decide if I want to back their stupid D&D book.

vbgibj,"If you're a new GM, run shorter games","Simplest piece of advice ever to some recent ""new GM"" posts I've seen around here: 

You may also want to have a long-winded epic tale, but consider that you need to explore more types of games and even systems.

- Even if you're in love with a system you play, you may get insight from playing other systems.

- Even if you do three different short games in the same system you're 100% sure you love, you were able to do have different approaches to it. Imagine investigating and fighting an active cult in the 1800s, finding old secrets in a manor long abandoned in the present and discovering a very scary conspiracy in the 1500s in CoC instead of just the first option. You'll learn a lot from diversity.

- You will be able to run all cool ideas on your mind.

- Games that have an ending are very cool. Ever had one? If not, try it. Taste the satisfaction of an ending and an epilogue. Make the epic sacrifices really mean something.

- You may experiment with a lot of ways to GM. You may not like to GM what you like to play. I like to play adventuring dungeoncrawls! I sure as hell hate GMing them.

- You may experiment with a lot of ways to play. The first time I ran political intrigue and conspiracy, I was a GM. I discovered then that I have a very found love for political intrigue and conspiracy since.

Don't plan any game to take over six months (this is a different number of game sessions for each group). If you like the short game, you may build a new one as a sequel. If you didn't like it so much but liked it just enough to continue playing, at least you can find something better to play without a premature end.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29cfcba40>,rpg,1655138726.0

ip3278,GM tip: Assume your players aren't dumb,"Heretical, I know.

So many RPG horror stories that I've seen have players doing seemingly nonsensical thing, oblivious to the result.  And a lot of times this results in bad feelings on the side of the players, with the GM saying, effectively ""well, I asked you if you were sure!""

Here's the thing, though.  As a GM, you have pretty much the authoritative view of the world in your head.  Like, for the most part, if you believe something to be true, it is.  And that doesn't just go for actual facts, but it also goes for cultures, reactions, etc.

One actual story I saw involved a character insulting the king of the country, and then being surprised when there was an extremely negative reaction (which I don't recall if it were imprisonment or straight up murder death kill).

Clearly, the GM thought that was reasonable.  Clearly, the player did not expect that.  And that's fine, the problem is that the GM's opinion is *objectively correct* in terms of the actual workings of the world.

So, when players suggest something suicidal, or with obvious negative consequences, *clarify the situation*.  Presume that this dumb move is not actually dumb, but is in fact a rational (ish) choice *based on inaccurate or incomplete information*.  And since you're the only one who *knows* the actual information, it is your job to ensure that the players know as much as their character would, and that they see what their character sees.  If anything, err on the side of over-disclosure, because your words are the only conduit that the players have to the world.

Apocalypse World calls it ""Name the consequences and act"".  And that's a way better approach than the typical ""are you sure?"" question that GMs typically use.  Because if you ask a player that, and give them no information, of *course* they're going to come up with the same answer!

A player might say:  ""I insult the King!""

You know this is a terrible idea, and will result in quick retribution or punishment.  So.... let's assume the player isn't dumb.  They would then only insult the King if they felt that doing so wouldn't result in quick imprisonment or retribution.  So clarify this with what the character would know, and ask.

""Yeah, you totally want to do that, and that's understandable.  But, you know that the rulers in this land are pretty sketchy on the topic of insults.  Heck, someone was hung just last week for impugning the King's honor.  And all the guards look a little on edge due to having you unkempt adventurers in there.  They're pretty obviously willing to throw down, and they look dangerous enough that things probably wouldn't go well for you.  So, is that something you still want to do?""

Here, we've clarified any misconceptions, and told the player everything the character would know and see.  Now, there's no way for them to claim that they didn't know what would happen, and if they choose to continue on that path, they can *own* the decision.

You're the only one who knows all the things.  It's *your job* to ensure that the players have correct and complete information, to the extent of their characters' knowledge and perceptions.  And, if anything, err on the side of giving out more info.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29d09d640>,rpg,1599602019.0

qtxqm1,Why GMing Isn't More Popular (& How Players & GMs Can Help Change That),"Recently, a post on r/dndnext [posed a simple question](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/qok9yr/how_can_we_make_more_people_want_to_dm/): How can the community make more people want to DM? It's not an easy question to answer, but it is one I think about a lot as someone who runs two (sometimes three) games a week - so I figured why not give my two cents. 

I want to explore why GMing isn't more popular as-is and follow up with suggestions the community or potential GMs may find helpful in making the role easier to access. This is far from an in-depth exploration of this topic, but hopefully, some will find it useful as an overview. 

## 5e Is Hard to GM. Like, Really Hard.

When I tell other GMs I run more than one game a week, they usually follow up by asking how prep doesn't monopolize my whole week. The answer is pretty simple: I don't run 5e, because 5e is hard as fuck to GM. 

**Although 5e is an awesome, jack-of-all trades system for players with a lot of versatility, it places a** ***huge*** **amount of responsibility on the GM.** While 5e is seen as the default ""introductory"" system for most players, I'd actually argue it's one of the hardest games to GM efficiently. 

I run my games in Pathfinder Second Edition and Worlds Without Number, and both are *leagues* easier to prep for and actually GM than 5e, albeit in different ways. **Let's look at some of the reasons why 5e is difficult to run:**

* **The books are poorly organized.** You never know how many pages you'll need to jump between to answer a simple question, and it's tedious. The fact that most books released in recent years were aimed at players instead of GMs also makes the GM role feel less supported than it deserves. 
* **The lore of the Forgotten Realms is difficult to parse, and most official adventures don't continue past lower levels.** As a result, making a game in the base Forgotten Realms setting is challenging, so many GMs will want to homebrew something or run a game in another official setting. While that's not terrible, it does mean contributing more effort or money to the hobby, which is just another barrier for new GMs to surpass. You'll also need to diverge from official adventures eventually if you want to run a 1-20 campaign (unless you want to use *Dungeon of the Mad Mage,* but c'mon). 
* **Combat is difficult to design and run.** Creature ratings aren't exactly known for their accuracy, and 5e stat blocks tend to be pretty simple, so GMs often end up homebrewing new abilities or scenarios to make encounters more engaging. It's a huge drain on prep time. Combat also becomes a slog in tiers three and four, making high-level play challenging to run. 
* **The ""rulings, not rules"" philosophy of the system burdens the GM with making moment-to-moment decisions.** As a result, the GM must often make consequential choices that players may disagree with. I've had more player disputes about rulings in 5e than any other system I've run. This isn't even getting into how auxiliary rules ""authorities,"" such as Sage Advice, make understanding or finding rulings even harder. 
* **The system isn't designed for the popular style of play.** D&D 5e encourages a high magic, combat-heavy, dungeon-delving playstyle (as the name implies) with lots of downtime between dungeons and fast leveling. There's a reason plate armor takes [75 days to craft](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/o8acsd/1_workweek_to_craft_a_50gp_comon_item_is/) RAW, but it only takes [37 adventuring days](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/65wikz/on_average_how_long_does_it_take_to_reach_level/) of medium encounters to get from level 1-20. This foundation is in stark contrast to the RP-heavy, day-by-day style of play most groups prefer. Groups can - and should - play as they want, but since the popular style of play contradicts the system, GMs have to do even more work to make the system function well if they run against it. 

These aren't the only things that make 5e hard to GM, but they're some of the big culprits that I think push GMs away. These issues are not mutually exclusive, either - they work in concert to make 5e uniquely challenging to run. Yes, you can address many of them by consuming supplemental material, such as Matt Colville's magnificent series [*Running the Game*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-YZvLUXcR8), but that makes sourcing and consuming third-party information another obstacle for new GMs to overcome. 

I purposefully avoided talking about social issues in the above section to illustrate a point: Even with an ideal group of players, 5e places so many hurdles in front of prospective GMs, it's little surprise many decide not to run the race. 

In contrast, I find both Pathfinder 2e and Worlds Without Number significantly easier to run. While the systems in and of themselves are considerably different, **they share similarities that contribute to their ease of use:**

* **The system materials are well-organized.** Finding answers to rules questions is easy and intuitive. More importantly, these systems actively eschew the ""rulings, not rules"" philosophy. Instead, they have clearly defined rules for everything that is likely to happen in an average adventuring day (and in the case of Pathfinder 2e, more besides). Having a clear-cut answer to every commonly asked question - one that's easy to find, no less - leads to fewer rules disputes at the table, and less time spent on navigating the material. 
* **Combat and exploration rules are easy to utilize (and they** ***work*****).** In Pathfinder 2e especially, creature levels (equivalent to creature ratings in 5e) are incredibly accurate, and statblocks have a wide range of flavorful abilities. Creating dynamic encounters is as easy as plugging creatures into the encounter-building rules and trusting the system, which is a far cry from the hours I'd spend trying to finagle and balance encounters in my 5e games to make combat more dynamic and enjoyable. 
* **The systems work for one encounter per day games.** In my experience, most players today prefer exploration and roleplay to combat encounters. You can easily run one encounter per day in Pathfinder 2e and Worlds Without Number (although they handle exploration and combat in vastly different ways) and come away with a challenging, fulfilling adventure without making the adjustments you'd need to achieve the same experience in 5e. 
* **The base settings are compelling**. Both Pathfinder 2e and Worlds Without Number have very digestible, compelling worldbuilding and timelines, making it easy for new GMs to design homebrew campaigns without building a whole new world (or purchasing a book for one). Pathfinder 2e's Adventure Paths also go from level 1-20, allowing new GMs who want a classic 1-20 campaign but don't feel comfortable homebrewing one to run a fulfilling game with minimal barrier to entry or need to consume third-party materials. 

Choosing to move away from 5e and run Pathfinder 2e and Worlds Without Number has made my life as a GM notably easier. I would *love* it if we saw an effort by WotC to make 5e easier to run. I'd be lying if I said I have hope that 5.5e will be more GM-friendly, but it sure would be a pleasant surprise. 

I'm not just here to bash 5e. Other systems also have a relatively small number of GMs compared to players, so let's talk about some other reasons GMing is hard. 

## GMs Act as Social Arbiters for Tables

At most tables, GMs are responsible not only for running the game (which is already a lot to handle), but they also have the final - and frequently, the only - say on any interpersonal conflicts that occur at the table. 

Problem player making someone (or everyone) uncomfortable? It's usually on the GM to call them out, in or out of game, and see if they can resolve the issue or need to kick the player. 

Player has an issue with RP or game balance? They usually have to go through the GM to resolve that issue or choose to leave the game. 

Player(s) need to cancel? It's on the GM to decide whether the game goes on or not, and if not, when the table should convene next. 

Players don't take notes? It's up to the GM to dig out their record of the last session and remind everyone what happened so the game can keep functioning. 

On the one hand, I get it. Nobody likes conflict. Even if a player breaks the social contract of a table, it can feel shitty to tell them they need to leave, especially if the table is a substantial part of their support network. Nobody likes being the ""bad guy"" who tells people to get their shit together so a game can happen regularly or notifies a player that they're taking too much spotlight. 

The GM also naturally has an increased responsibility at the table due to their role. If the GM doesn't show up to run the game, the game doesn't happen. In most groups - especially those formed online - the GM is responsible for bringing all the players to the table in the first place. As a result, the GM often becomes the Judge Dredd of TTRPG social issues.

It's a lot of responsibility to take on in addition to putting a game together. Worse still, it contributes to the GM vs. Player mentality some players have. Most GMs I know often complain about feeling like schoolteachers as much as Game Masters, which obviously isn't great. 

In an ideal world, GMs would be able to expect mature behavior, a fundamental understanding of tabletop etiquette, and the social contract of the table from players. Unfortunately, the standing precedent that GMs are responsible for solving the majority of conflicts that arise at tables pushes away prospective GMs who are either conflict-avoidant or just don't want (understandably) to have to police the behavior of adults over a game. 

## You Have to Love Prep (& How Your Players Ruin It)

Most acting coaches tell students the same thing: To be a successful actor, [you have to learn to love auditioning](http://www.workingactorwisdom.com/blog/2015/9/15/learn-to-love-auditions), because you'll spend more time in auditions than you will on screen. 

GMs need to have a similar relationship to game prep. Of course, the amount of prep you do as a GM is system-dependent to a large degree. **But at the very least, you have to enjoy the process of things like:** 

* Creating NPC personalities and speech patterns or voices;
* Sourcing or making battle maps; 
* Balancing encounters;
* Piloting the plot and establishing story beats;
* Working with players on backstories and weaving said backstories into the campaign;
* Deciding how the world moves and breathes around the players;
* Learning the ins and outs of the system mechanics;
* Remaining updated on the newest developments of the system;
* Collaborating with players to ensure everyone's having a good time;
* Taking notes on player actions and how they interact with the world;

The list goes on and on. Point being, prepping for a game is a hell of a lot of work, and it doesn't stop when the game starts. Even in relatively rules-lite games, such as *Dungeon World, Worlds Without Number,* or *Stonetop*, you'll end up doing a significant amount of prep - and if you don't like it, you're probably not going to find GMing much fun. 

As a result of the time investment required to GM, most GMs feel incredibly attached to their worlds and characters, and rightfully so. Of course, another crucial aspect of GMing is rolling with the punches and having players fuck with - or up - - or just period - the things you create. For many GMs, that's hard - and who can blame them? 

*I'd like to note here that I'm not talking about players who try and purposefully fuck with their GM or the table. Amazing, well-intentioned players will come up with solutions the GM never considered or want to try things unaccounted for during prep. Learning to enable such experiences if it would enhance the fun of the table is essential, but can be challenging.* 

The lack of investment many players have in their games further complicates issues. For many GMs, their campaigns and worlds occupy a significant portion of their lives and thoughts. Not so for many players, or at the very least, not to the same degree. 

The obligations of players and GMs are inherently imbalanced in a way that can make behavior most players wouldn't think twice about - such as constantly joking when a GM attempts to foster a serious moment, barbing the GM about a missed ruling or failing to add something to a character sheet, etc. - much more hurtful and disrespectful from the GM's perspective. As a result, many GMs seem overly protective of their worlds and games, at least from a player's point of view. 

For new GMs who aren't used to navigating this dynamic, the process of painstakingly creating a world or session and then handing it off to players can feel like pitching an egg at someone and hoping they catch it without making a scramble. 

The good news, of course, is that a table of players who understand the social contract of TTRPGs can help Gms make a world far more vibrant, fun, and interesting than anything they could create on their own. 

The bad news, is that when a GM is attached to their world, they'll get hurt when players don't treat your game with respect. Having players cancel on you last minute or fail to take notes isn't just a bummer because you don't get to play or have to explain something again; it feels like your friends are actively choosing to disrespect the amount of time it takes to prep for and run a game - valid feelings that should be taken more seriously if we want more people to run games. 

At the end of the day, GMing for any system takes a hell of a lot of work, love, and effort (and even more so for 5e). With so many obstacles in front of the average GM, it's little wonder most choose to forego running games entirely, or abandon GMing after their first attempts. 

## Give Ya GM a Break - Player Practices to Encourage More GMs

So, let's return to the premise of this discussion - how can the community encourage more people to GM? I'll break this into two components - things players can do to make life easier for GMs, and things GMs can do to make life easier for themselves. 

**First, let's cover some things players can do to help GMs out:**

* **Go with the plan.** I get it. One of the best parts about TTRPGs is the ability to just kinda do... whatever (within reason of the boundaries set by the table and the basic social contract of not being a bad person). Despite how tempting doing whatever can be, respect where your GM is guiding the story. Going off in a completely different direction just because you think it may be fun will almost always lead to a less satisfying experience than working with the GM to engage with prepped content, and it often has the additive effect of pissing off players who want to follow a main or side quest delineated by the GM. 
* **Trust the GM.** At a mature table, everyone is there to ensure each other has fun - GM included. Unless your  GM is clearly fucking with you, try not to second-guess them regarding enemy or NPC behavior and dice rolls. It can be very easy to view the GM as someone playing against you, but that should never be the case - the GM should be there to give the party a guiding hand towards a fulfilling gameplay experience. Giving some trust to the GM is a vital part of the social contract of the table. 
* **Make discussions tablewide.** As we discussed, concerns about player behavior or other tablewide mechanics often become discussions few are privy to. Players can help alleviate some of the burden of GMing by encouraging tablewide conversations about concerns and feedback. Making the table an open forum for more matters can help everyone trust each other and quickly identify acceptable compromises. 
* **Do your own bookkeeping.** I never mind reiterating a point or two to players, but keep in mind that failing to remember an important NPC's name after the third meeting makes it looks like you just don't care about the story. This also extends to character sheets. GMs have to deal with NPC and monster stat blocks; they shouldn't be responsible for figuring out how your character operates. You should know your attack bonuses, saving throws, armor class, what your spells do, etc., without the GM's aid. 
* **Notify the table of scheduling issues in advance.** Scheduling issues are one of the most oft-cited issues at TTRPG tables. Failing to notify the table of your absence at least a few days in advance is simply disrespectful (outside of emergencies, obviously). If your GM can spend hours in the week leading up to the session prepping a gameplay experience for you, you can spend 15 seconds on a message saying you won't be able to attend in advance. This is particularly vital in games where player backstories are a focus - nothing feels worse than prepping a session for a player's backstory, only to have them cancel at the last minute. 
* **Be an active participant at the table.** You should always try to stay engaged, even when your character isn't the focus of a scene - or hell - is off-screen entirely. These are your friends you're at the table with. Give them your time and respect. The more invested everyone is in each other's story, the more fun the game will be in its entirety. Don't be the person who pulls their phone out or interjects anytime their character isn't the focus. 
* **Make a character for the party.** Antagonists and anti-heroes work well in other forms of media because we can root against them - Boromir is one of my favorite characters in *Lord of the Rings,* but I'd hate to share a table with him. It takes a hell of a player to pull off an evil character without making it an issue for everyone else, and a hell of a table to make that kind of arc fun for everyone. Unless the whole table agrees evil characters are kosher, players should make someone who will, at the very least, work with the party. If a character is only kept at the table because the players don't want to make a friend sad by exiling his weird edgy mess of an alter-ego, that's not a good character. Dealing with such dynamics can also be very troublesome as a GM. 

This is far from an exhaustive list - another blog for another time, perhaps - but I think if more players made a conscious effort to take these issues into account, GMing would undoubtedly be a lot more inviting. 

## Give Yaself a Break - Making GMing Easier

**With ways players can make the GM role less intimidating covered, let's look at how GMs can help themselves:**

* **Set defined boundaries.** It's okay to tell players that certain races/ancestries/what have you aren't allowed at the table, or that characters can't worship evil deities and should all be part of the same organization. You should collaborate with the table to find a premise for the game everyone is happy with (yourself included!), but setting boundaries is extremely important. You're there to have fun, not headache over how to incorporate outrageous homebrews or character concepts that don't fit your campaign into your world. 
* **Consider other systems.** As I mentioned, 5e is hard as fuck to GM, at least in my experience. If you want a more narrative-based experience, I'd suggest looking into Dungeon World for something analogous to 5e but much more RP-focused. Stonetop, Blades in the Dark, Apocalypse World, and other Powered By the Apocalypse games are also great for more narrative experiences. If you want tactical combat and lots of character options, consider something like Pathfinder 2e. You don't have to move away from 5e by any means, but it never hurts to have alternatives. 
* **Allocate prep time wisely.** No, you don't need to know the names of everyone in the town - that's why you keep a name generator open. When prepping for a session, always think about where you would go and who you would want to interact with as a player. Focus on quality over quantity - make a few memorable NPCs or locations where your players are, and steer them in the direction of those individuals and places. The truth is, few players will care about things like exactly how much gold the local currency translates into, or what each townsfolk's background is. But topics such as *why* the town doesn't use gold, or a vignette showcasing the types of lives townsfolk lead may go over better. Prep should be enjoyable and help your world make a lasting impression on the party, not be a chore. 
* **Steal shit when possible.** I won't say how much my Patreon bill amounts to out of shame, but I use other people's shit *constantly* (although, I suppose it's not exactly stealing if it's paid for). The wealth of resources surrounding TTRPGs on the internet is mindboggling. The amount of free and paid content GMs have access to is ridiculous, so make like a renaissance painter and co-opt as much of it as you possibly can for your game. Two heads are almost always better than one - even if you end up entirely warping the concept of something you find online to make it suit your world, third-party material is extremely useful as a source of inspiration. 
* **Accept imperfection.** Unless you're a GM who happens to make a lot of money off their game and also be a trained actor, don't hold yourself to the standard of a Brendan Lee Mulligan or Matthew Mercer. Your games won't always be perfect. You'll have plot holes. Some NPCs will use the same voice. You won't always be prepped for every path players take. Sometimes an encounter won't be as fun as you'd hoped. And you know what? Good. You've got a life to live and shit to do. GM because it's fun, not because you feel like a slave to how perfect your table could be if you only had this or did that. Always strive for improvement, but accept imperfections. 

At the end of the day, TTRPGs work best as a medium when everyone is as concerned about each other's fun and experiences as they are about their own. GMing is unpopular due to the obstacles in front of new GMs and how the role currently functions in TTRPG pop culture, but both GMs and players can take steps to make running games less daunting.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29d1c7c50>,rpg,1636919234.0

hdqdoc,"[Mod approved] Hi! My company makes custom LEGO minifigs and I'd love to get your feedback on the first draft of our TTRPG minis, focused on 5E","Hello there! I've been hanging around this sub for a while now and have been wanting to get these little guys made for THE LONGEST TIME. I've asked both /r/rpg and /r/legodnd for help on these, [so I'm hoping you can give us some feedback on this first draft.](http://imgur.com/gallery/xjtHFle). They aren't released yet, but when they are they will probably be between £12-15 (printed customs are tough to make, man). We'll be offering plenty of accessories and weapons to go along with them :)

The plan is that people will be able to buy their own character as a custom printed LEGO minifigure. We've made outfits for 12 classes, and heads for the more common races (and a couple of extra heads that seemed like they'd work well with specific classes). We'll also be selling a variety of hair types made by LEGO, including some with elf-like ears, and also some hoods and capes.

The thing is, there's a lot to do and you all seemed like you'd have pretty useful feedback. So here's the first draft!

1. Do the outfits and faces fit your expectations? Like is the Barbarian too clothed? Is that how you picture dwarf facial hair? Do you like where the sigils are located on the cleric and paladin (the sigils themselves will be customisable)?

2. We tried to make the outfits unisex, but are there any outfits here where you think we specifically need to do a female version?

3. Would you be happy with those outfit colours, or do you think we should do a specifically different colour for any particular class? Or would you really want a choice of colours for any of them?

4. We can't make custom-shaped pieces, so we've done designs for the tiefling and dragonborn on normal minifigure head shapes. Do you think it works?

5. Is there anything obvious we're missing here? e.g. is there a head you would have expected us to do that we've missed out?

Any other feedback you have is also greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance; I can't wait to hear your thoughts! This has been a long time coming :)

TLDR: We're making TTRPG minifigs and need your feedback on the first draft",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29d2bed80>,rpg,1592824031.0

9v1bw7,"RPGs: The Older We Get, the More We Need Them and the Less We Can Play Them","How do.

RPGs are the best damn thing ever. Get together with friends, be yourself, everyone has a good time (even the rules debates are good fun with close friends).

However, as we get older and priorities shift to kid-having, job-doing, and holy-shit-I'm-tireding in the evenings, RPGs fall off the map. As we get older, there's less time for creativity as we try and push through each day to make it to the weekend. If you have kids, that weekend gets carved up pretty damned quick.

RPGs are amazing because of the creative energy that takes place in them. As we get older, we need more of this to feel like human beings with thoughts in our heads that are interesting. Funny thing is, 'success' is like a big, damn rewind in years as far as the perception of RPGs. I've found the higher up you get promoted, the more the hobby is received as odd or silly.

I went through all this and am emerging to try and recapture that much-needed creativity. What I'm finding is that young folks are deeply protective of their groups at my FLGS and aren't looking for some older 'fogey' to mess up the dynamic.

I've tried card games and found them too 'mechanical' for my tastes.

I know that online gaming is a thing, but I sit at a computer all day and would prefer to get away from it.

Years later adventure League was like 3 tables at Comic Con, a sub group at best.  

Board games were Rio Grande, Fantasy Flight and Hasbro/Avalon and number of  others, not nearly as much as now.

 A year or so ago someone told me DND 5e would be the death of the Indie scene but it seems to have only strengthened it.  Are we in it or entering into a golden age of games.

Will this be the peak of creativity and innovation.  Every popular thing hits that peak bench mark and everything is good but not quiet the same.  Rock music in the 60s and 70s.  Rap music in the 90s and 80s.  That might be too subjective.  How about Pixar, they had a peak of creative vibrance.

11k4bpx,"What's the most creepy, ""wait what"" moments you've had in a game?","Horror is hard to do in TRPGs, we all know that. Terror is the same. Creepy...well, also the same. It requires buy in from both sides of the table. 

But for me, creepy has proved to be a bit more effective without requiring as much buy in. Two of the best examples that have stuck to me I found on Reddit, and I really wish I could give credit where it's due, if I'd remembered who said them.

1. Someone describes an aasimar's appearance to someone. ""Mithra turns to regard you. All of her eyes twinkling.""

""Wait, uh...*all* of her eyes? I take a closer look. How many eyes she got?

""...Two. :)""

2. A party of four finds an inn, one that's fairly quiet, with only a few other patrons. The lively innkeep describes the rooms, the cost for each. ""Right then. So will you be splitting it between the five of you?""

""You mean four.""

The innkeep nods at a space behind the party. They turn---nothing is there. ""Oh right sorry, haha, I meant four. Think someone's here a little too mischievous with illusion magic!"" Bonus points if the party has just come back from exploring a wizard's tower or an undead crypt. 


So, what are some creepy moments in your game that run on similar vibes? As a player or GM, either way!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29f232fc0>,rpg,1678121861.0
nwqv3u,After the last campaign I made every PC be the GM for an easy one-shot. Here's what they said afterwards,"We play once a week for about 2hr and I wanted everyone to grow their hobby, while learning myself as a GM from their experiences. Everyone had a different one-page ruleset to use. There are 6 PC in our group, so it took about two months to do. When we chatted together about it (part of session 0 for my next campaign) here's what they said:

**GMing Thoughts by Others**


*I love the idea of being so committed to the rules and story that even though you don't want to, you follow through on the fiction and kill NPC


*I loved being surprised and improvising based on what the PC did


*It was harder than I thought. I had a struggle to not railroad the players while providing enough structure


*It was harder than I thought. How much content to put in was a struggle


*It was harder than I thought. Pacing peaked early as novelty wore off, then it felt like a slog


*It was easier than I thought. I planned a lot, but you can only plan some. The unplanned parts were the best


*I liked inventing rules, settings, and templates for people to use


*Creativity loves constraint. Some things need to be off limits to let the players invent creatively


*One shots allow more creativity as there are no lasting consequences for failure


*I thought that the one shots that were the most fun had more structure. With a background in improvisation I thought I could do it all on the fly, but it turned out I didn't have enough. I'll prepare more next time",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29f24a030>,rpg,1623340005.0

110jw4b,"I backed an indie RPG for the first time, my personal experience.","(This is a personal experience, maybe its nothing new to most of you)  
Last week I saw announced here a new Kickstarter coming up. I have never backed anything there, so I just went to take a peek.This project had a great concept and great art, so I decied to back it.  


The next couple of days they hosted an AMA on discord, I was weirded out that it wasn't on twitter or reddit as other AMAs I've seen.I joined the call and the actual developers were there! This may seem normal (or not) to you, but please bare with me, as an only DnD player it seemed pretty surreal.They seemed as such passionate and down to earth guys.They told some of the guys in the call to play a game at friday. At that time I wasn't sure if it was an empty promise or not, but I surprised. They were playing with people at the server.I asked if I could join the call and watched the end of the session, then I spent like 2 hours talking with the developers.  


Why I was giving all my money to a big developer like WoTC? They clearly dont give a sh\*t about us as community, even less about us as individuals.I'm not saying all of the WoTC employees are at fault, I'm sure there are some passionate guys out there, but when we support small/new creators we can assure that all of our support goes to the people who actually care, not to some Hasbro executive that is planning on how to charge us for everytime we throw a die.  
(Sorry again if I'm the only one here who realised this just now, Im a noob at TTRPGs as a whole)

i5j1p5,/r/LFG is a mess,"**To the mods of** /r/RPG, **I'm sorry for posting this here, but I don't know where else to post since** /r/LFG **isn't allowing discussion.**

&#x200B;

For a long time on /r/LFG there have been GMs who are serial ghosters.  It used to be that users of the sub would call out these kinds of GMs whenever they posted an ad, so that they didn't screw over newbies, since the mods didn't seem to care.

&#x200B;

A little while ago, the mods took it to a whole different level.  They're now banning people who call out the ghosters, so the ghosters are just getting away with it.

&#x200B;

It would be nice to talk about this on /r/LFG itself, but the mods posted a locked sticky which says that not only do they refuse to debate the issue, but if you try it, they'll ban you.  [You can read it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/hzho65/regarding_our_policy_on_ghosting_and_our_policy/)  So here I am on /r/RPG.

&#x200B;

The LFG mods are claiming that calling out ghosters is targetted harassment.  It's not.  Here's the Reddit policy on harassment

&#x200B;

>Being annoying, downvoting, or disagreeing with someone, even strongly, is not harassment. However, menacing someone, directing abuse at a person or group, following them around the site, encouraging others to do any of these actions, or otherwise behaving in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit crosses the line.

&#x200B;

No one is being menacing.  No one is directing abuse.  (People are posting messages that say to check out the GM's post history.)  No one is following them around the site.  (People **are** watching for them on LFG, but there's nothing wrong with that, according to the rules.)  No one is encouraging others to do these things.

&#x200B;

Does it discourage reasonable people from participating?  Depends on what your definition of reasonable is, I guess.  To me, someone who is just here to ruin other people's day by ghosting them isn't really a reasonable person.  The people who are there to actually use the sub are fine, and they deserve better moderation than just being thrown to the wolves.

&#x200B;

So I guess I'm asking whether there's anyway to get the mods of /r/LFG to go back to being useless instead of being Dolores Umbridges?  It would be great if they would actually **do** something, but if they aren't then I wish they would just let the community police itself and not go after the people who are trying to help.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29f3eccb0>,rpg,1596824484.0

5w2r2m,Session report! I was recruited to run a D&D game night for a bunch of tweenagers at my son's school.,"So my son's school was having a ""lock-in"" tonight, which is basically a ""drop your kids off and we'll watch them until 10pm while the parents go have a date night"" event, and like a fool, I allowed myself to get roped into helping out by running a session of *Dungeons and Dragons* for a gaggle of tweenagers instead of going on a date night with my wife.

Here's a session report.

I had no idea how many kids were going to be playing.  I knew it would be at least two, since my son and one of his friends had conscripted me, but there was no known upper bound on the number of players.  It was also extremely likely that I would have players who were completely new to *Dungeons and Dragons*.  And to top it off, the amount of time we'd have to play was uncertain - somewhere between one and three hours.

So, rather than playing D&D, I decided to kitbash [*Sidekick Quests*](http://sidekickquests.com/learn-the-game/) to make the introduction easy.  *Sidekick Quests* is a very simple but effective RPG system designed for very young kids, and it has the virtue of having just about the entire game system embedded on your character sheet, and being dead simple to learn.  This is exactly what I needed.  The down side is that it's way too juvenile for my target audience, better geared for second graders than seventh graders.  For instance, the example quests involve going to a field and picking magic flowers or babysitting infant owlbears.  They're adorable and effective for the right audience, but it would not have flown for these kids.

But with some changes to the powers and other flavor text, I was able to pull forward that system to a more age-appropriate level.  I basically translated the typical D&D archetypes into the *Sidekick Quests* system, substituting things like talking to animals and finding useful things on the map with backstab and rebuking undead.  I also borrowed the concept of ""awesome points"" and ""hitting them in the *face*"" from [*Old School Hack*](http://www.oldschoolhack.net).

It's a good thing that I made several copies of the characters, because when the time came to play, I had **nine** kids gathered around the table wanting to play!  Yikes!  I wasn't about to turn any kid away, though, so we plunged right in.

Luckily, the *Sidekick Quest* system runs like a dream, and is super fast.  On their turn, the player moves, says what they want to do, and you say, ""Okay, are you tough enough?"" or ""Okay, are you smart enough?""  Right there on their character sheet, it says, ""When asked if you are tough enough, roll d20 + 5"" or something similar.  They roll, you choose a target number, and that's it.  The kids picked it up immediately, and each turn zipped by.  Even with the typical tweenager antics and nine players to get through per round, the game moved very quickly.

It was very chaotic and loud, however.  Much talking and shouting, but that is to be expected from the age group.  As the evening wore on, however, players got more focused on the game, and it ran more and more smoothly as they got into the rhythm of how it all works.

We played for about three hours, minus two breaks, and got a full adventure with three combat scenes in.  It started with the players stumbling upon some animated scarecrows attempting to abduct a little girl from a nearby village.  After dispatching them and saving the girl, the heroes went into the town and got some sleep, and then convened with the town elder in the morning.  He suspected that the culprit was a necromancer who moved into an old tower twenty years before and began reanimating the town's loved ones from the graveyard.  The townsfolk rose up and burned the tower to the ground, and the necromancer along with it, but not before the necromancer vowed revenge.

The heroes then headed towards the tower.  They set up a base camp outside the tower, and had to fight some more scarecrows outside the tower which had emerged to go abduct more townsfolk.  Entering the tower, they found the bodies of the missing townsfolk strewn about a hidden basement that had largely survived the fire.  Hovering over them was a mystical wisp that animated the corpses to attack when the PCs arrived.  A heated battle broke out, and eventually, the PCs destroyed all the corpses and robbed the wisp of its power, defeating the necromancer once and for all.

Because of parents coming, we had several kids have to leave mid-game, but as quickly as kids left, we picked up other kids from the crowd.  We had spectators as well as players.  Several kids stuck with it from beginning to end (minus forays to fetch pizza and other necessities), and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  We did get a few of the older ""cool"" kids from the school sticking their heads in and shouting ""nerds"", but to their credit, not a single one of my players seemed even remotely fazed by it.  The fun continued without a blip.  (And by the end of the evening, one of the kids that had called them nerds was one of our spectators!)

I let the players keep their character sheets, and I had bought a fistful of d20's to give out, so each kid got to go home with their own d20.  My motive here was to give them the tools to continue the games without me at school - the way *Sidekick Quest* is structured, that's really all they need to play, and it will be a breeze for a kid to pick up as referee.  I'll probably write up some adventures in the *Sidekick Quest* style, too, to give them, to help the process along.

Most of the kids thanked me for running the game, they stayed after to help clean up, and I hear that they asked the principal there if they could start a D&D club at the school.  And on the way home, my son asked me to teach him how to be a DM.

Overall, I'd say the evening was a *geek dad win.*

py585d,Stop getting the GM to deal with personal player issues for you,"Repeatedly on this subreddit and in the RPG scene in general I see a false idea that if a player has a problem with another player, they should ask the GM to deal with it, there is a false sense that because the GM has added authority in gameplay they have the same in personal issues between players. **It is completely unfair to make it the GM's responsibility to deal with personal problems for you, as they do not actually have more authority on personal issues than anyone else.**

*Some common examples include:*

\- Two Players having an argument? Its up to the GM to mediate it

\- One player using language or jokes another doesn't approve of? The GM has to be the one to ask them to stop

\- One player is a fucking creep? The GM has to be the one to ask them to leave, not because they are most comfortable doing so but purely because they are the GM.

\- A GM has to pick sides between two players? They have to undergo the stress of that, without sharing it out between the group.

In NONE of these situations should one player do nothing, for instance **if one player is acting in a creepy way to another the player that feels uncomfortable should not stay silent,** but they should come to the group with the issue, as it's unfair to put the pressure of dealing with a pretty stressful situation all on any one person (does anyone ever consider the GM may feel vulnerable confronting someone who they may also find intimidating or creepy?). In a similar vein, if you are frustrated with of another player (this could be you find their humour juvenile, or playstyle annoying), don't expect the GM to tell them it's annoying for you, tell them yourself, because you're just jeprodizing the GM's relationship with that other player you find annoying.

Something complicating this is the fact if the GM alone is approached they may feel they have to make the decision(s) involved alone because they've been asked, and they may feel they're failing their players by not acting alone, so the GM ends up being pressured into solving the problem whether or not it's right for them to do so alone.

Automatically expecting the GM to deal with personal issues just because they have higher authority on the gameplay leads to GM's having to pick sides, endanger friendships, deal with stressful situations on their own, or act on behalf of an entire group of people when only they have been consulted, and nobody would ever put this expectation on someone in a normal social situation.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29f54aab0>,rpg,1632951124.0

lu25uz,"Has D&D changed, or was I playing it wrong as a kid?","My teenage kids have engaged us in playing D&D; they've both been playing over Zoom with their friends (pandemic, sigh), and they thought it would be fun to start up a campaign with us as well. So the older one is DM; the other one is a player along with me and mom.

The last time I played D&D at all, really, was back in the early 1980s, when I was their age or younger. We had played with the basic set, with the blue dragon on the cover. My memory of the experience is entirely different from what I'm seeing now. I'm curious as to whether the game has dramatically changed, whether we had no idea what we were doing way back when, or whether it's a difference in playing style.

My memory of playing BD&D a gazillion years ago with the neighborhood kids was that we did purely dungeon crawls. We were using the modules that came with the set and then a couple of others we bought at the nearby hobby shop, and they all provided a detailed gridded layout of the dungeon / tomb / whatever that the DM could see. The DM would lay out a blank piece of graph paper on the table, and as the players explored, the DM would carefully draw out bit by bit the layout from the module within the range of what the characters could expect to see (dim lighting, etc). So in principle, if we explored everything, which we never succeeded at doing, we'd end up with an exact replica on the graph paper of what was in the module.

So my memory of the experience as a tween/young teen player was that we'd spend a lot of time looking at that paper. There would be a door at the end of the corridor, and then the DM would stop drawing there. We would break open the door, and then the DM would draw the intersection beyond. If there were monsters there, the DM might put a small mark with a pencil indicating where they were, and so on. Occasionally the DM would screw up transcribing the map --- which we'd discover when a passage looped back to where we had previously been, perhaps --  and so the DM would go back and erase and fix some stuff. Etc.

Anyway, now the kids have us playing modern D&D. The rules changes in rolling dice to make a character, e.g., aren't surprising or weird to me: it's a new edition, details change. What is surprising to me is how it seems like an entirely different experience. There's no graph paper at all or even a dungeon. Instead, my elder kid as DM is describing a walk across the countryside, purely verbally telling us what we see. Though he has some basic ideas as to where we're going, he's clearly making a whole lot of it up as he goes as well. Instead of working out details on how to get around a dungeon and fiddling with lines on paper, everything is just talked out. And of course, dice are rolled, and a few stats are updated.

It feels to me as though we're playing an entirely different game than the one I remember. I could raise a host of questions relating to which is more enjoyable, but I'll put that aside for the moment.  I'm mostly just extremely curious: is this just a difference in style? Are there people who play D&D today the way I describe above? Or is that how people (or at least some people) used to play, and the game has changed? Or, did the kids in my neighborhood have no idea what they were doing, and we weren't really playing (B)D&D at all the way it was meant to be played?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x29f699850>,rpg,1614475548.0
s5jf07,I think I'm done playing paid GM games. Tried 3 separate times and all 3 have been terrible,"I tried the first time about a year ago. Started a Curse of Strahd campaign, just about everyone died in the death house. Everyone decided to play Call of Cthulhu after that and the GM stopped the game because everyone in the group was basically murder hoboing everything. 

I tried the second time last night with a game of Mouse Guard. I used Startplaying.games to schedule the session. It was basically bare minimum effort. Everything was ""theatre of the mind"", the GM wanted the party to basically handle everything and the rules were completely loose with the phases basically being abandoned. Nothing was described, there was like 1 or 2 NPC's in 2 major towns (no names, descriptions, pictures, etc.) and we basically completed the mission in 1 sitting.

I tried the third time today. Sessions is scheduled for 6PM EST. I used startplaying.games and everything was on there, scheduled for 6PM. The GM and I were messaging on Discord today about making characters and then all of a sudden, I get an alert on Discord that the game is from 2PM-6PM EST. I check Startplaying.games and the session is gone, no way for me to verify anything. I let the people in the Discord server know that the bump up time wouldn't work for me due to prior commitments, the guy in the wait-list could take my spot and the GM bans me from the server and ignores my messages

I cannot stand this mindset of pay to play, but put in bare minimum effort, not know the rules, etc. If I'm paying you good money (and some of these sessions are $20+ bucks each so that's almost $100 a month to play a game) to run a game, I expect their to be an attempt at production value, content, quality, etc. It feels like because of the explosion of TTRPG's due to COVID that this is a new ""side hustle"" and irritates the piss out of me.

I've enjoyed all of the big Star Wars RPGs I've played and run over the years (WEG d6, Saga, FFG SWRPG, etc) but I wanted to provide my boy with a game so simple that he would have no issue hitting the ground running into the Star Wars universe.

The game is fully contained in the above post from my RPG blog. It is very narrative focused and framed by realism and high stakes. We agree to trust each other in good faith, treat the game world like a real place, and use common sense (and a dash of Star Wars cinematic heroism) to facilitate all manner of hijinks, daring, and action. The rules are only present enough to get out of the way of an exciting game—not an ounce of “crunch” to be found.

e4svlp,"TIL the actual definition of ""Grognard""","Hearing the term passed around in reference to older nerds who nitpick at obscure rules and hold fast to outdated editions of ttrpgs, often seen as guilty of gatekeeping the hobby from younger or newer players, I was expecting the word to have a root in fantasy or scifi. I was imagining some shriveled creature that hides in a cave and mulls over ancient texts for centuries at a time, akin to the excessively bureaucratic [Vogons](https://youtu.be/IxPeIiU2kx4) from *Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy*.

So you can imagine my surprise when I googled the term and found out they were the name of the [Imperial Guard of Napoleon I](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grognard).

I thought it may have been a coincidence at first, but then I realized that D&D has its origins in classical wargaming, which often set battles *during* the Napoleonic era, where a grognard was very likely an actual unit to be played, and that these soldiers themselves were often the aging *old guard* comprised of highly experienced veterans.

I don't know when the term was first applied in the context we're familiar with, but it struck me as funny that the term itself may have possibly been applied to aging grumpy nerds all the way back in the days of *Chainmail* before D&D was even a thing. Maybe even self-applied!

yyigtk,Transformers rpg is honestly kind of heartbreaking [rant],"So I finally got my physical copy of the Transformers RPG last week after pre-ordering it back in February. I was fully aware of what it would be: a kind of low-effort 5E hack with slightly different terminology. But I was fine with that, I rarely run games RAW so I was prepared to tweak and hack and house rule. I figured that there'd be a decent skeleton to work with. Plus I love Transformers: I'm not just some GeeWun nostalgia blinded casual fan, I've kept pace with the franchise for years and love both the deep lore and the great potential for storytelling the franchise has.

I thought it would be *fine.*

But to paraphrase Prime from the banging Cybertron theme, OUR GAMES ARE IN DANGER

(disclaimer, this is all my opinion, if you like the Essence system/5E, good for you, my dislike doesn't invalidate your preferences)

Firstly this book is just a mess in terms of layout. You have to get about 120 pages in before it starts actually explaining rules, so chances are you waded through a bunch of character stuff with zero context for what any of it means. Then usual bloat of more character options and combat rules. Then 80ish pages of enemy statblocks. You want advice how to actually structure and run a game? Here's like four paragraphs they vaguely talk about doing an equal mix of combat, exploration, and social interaction. OKAY COOL THANKS CHAMP.

Alt mode rules aren't awful. I was dreading this but they make the smart choice of generalising vehicle types. But ffs some of the language/terminology choice is so bad. Your alt mode is your ""Origin""? A tank alt mode is a ""Rainmaker""? Oh and no rules for beast modes. We can apparently have a fifth of the book be statblocks but can't have dedicate a page for covering beast mode alt modes - sorry, Origin - rules. Got to have something for the supplemental books I guess.

Characters are just 5E copy paste jobs. 20 levels, with multiple small perks because that's what D&D does so we should do it too! 👍 The list of skills is the same. Why the fuck does my Transformers game have Animal Handling and Performance skills in it? Going to be rolling lots of acting checks are we? Is that the intended tone for the game? I have to guess because the GM advice is aggressively minimal. 

I have a bunch of other gripes but I just wanted to get all that out now. Honestly stay away from this one, it's a wreck. But not the cool Wreck 'N' Rule type, the bad kind. 

The good thing is that it's inspired me to start writing my own game based on Unity's ruleset as I think that fits Transformers better.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a02c1d60>,rpg,1668773026.0

11g7mxw,Does it ever feel like you murder an incredible amount of people?,"Title says it all really. Been playing Pathfinder 2e since my current group swapped fron DnD 5e about 4 years ago, but I've been playing TTRPG'S pretty consistently for the last 10 years with a couple of groups, and I started thinking - Almost anywhere there's bad guys, we kill them. All of them. We leave a god damn wake of corpses every where we go. I have tried to reason with villains multiple times on this alone saying we will fucking kill you, and we will win, nobody has stopped us yet, and you won't get lucky. I know it would probably be lame to just have an encounter end there, but I'm being dead serious, and I don't know how else to point this out to our enemies that the numbers are not in their favor here.

 Sparing is just a lot of the times not an option, because of some combination of the following:

1. The creature is physically or mentally incapable of understanding the party
2. The creature is turbo evil and decides that the succulent taste of human flesh outweighs any concept of morality.
3. Non lethal options are not available and/or the creature fights to the death
4. We have no means of ensuring that they do not hurt anyone else after combat outside of...
5. Our most common means of ensuring they do not hurt anyone else means turning around to make a 4 day trek back to town to take 3 orcs in as prisoners... where the town shortly thereafter has a very strong chance to have them executed.

Like, holy shit. You kill so many people it feels like sometimes. Oh my god. There is no way this doesn't attract psychopaths left and right as a means of getting a license to murder, and then getting praised for it. You can play LE characters that just love killing people and nobody would suspect a thing so long as  you only target your ballistic warhead of a character at groups of people hated.

Edit: Thank you so much for responding and engaging! I'm glad this got a lot of attention to kind of say it explicitly - and I do think it's something I've kind of sub consciously worked into my campaigns I've run in the past with about a 60/40 split between combat and non combat encounters, and establishing both as being high stakes and meaningful, and having enemies be reasonable enough to surrender and cooperate with players from disadvantaged positions sometimes even. You all gave some great answers to think about. I think the ones I found the most interesting and engaging answers usually were with regards to sociological media analysis regarding our perception of violence as it relates to challenges, fantasies, power, and obviously power fantasy.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a03bd9a0>,rpg,1677776053.0

d8mdrs,"Just bailed on my players, am i the asshole or am i rightfully not appreciated enough?","Long story short, I convinced a bunch of my friends to players vampire: the masquerade with me, we've been playing for the past month and it's been fun, after we played on sunday one of them proposed we play today(tuesday) I was a bit hesitant, because i knew that i'd only get off work at midnight on monday and i'm working today in the evening(we're all 19, uni students and i'm the only one of them who has a job, they like to laugh at me for it), not giving us much time to play and me time to prepare, but anyway, I agreed because they all seemed very excited to play. So, yesterday I come home from work at midnight and I start assembling a rough story/make characters for them and I only went to sleep at around 3-4AM, giving me only a couple of hours of sleep as we agreed to play at noon. I get up in the morning feeling awful, I did not think of anything at all, I had a bunch of stuff to get done before work and on top of that I was very stressed out about work(anxiety issues), so I text one of my players that I'm honestly not in the mood to play today, I wanted to give them a heads-up because well, to me, if the DM isn't having fun/is not prepared/is tired etc., then all of the players are not going to have fun, right? And the response I got honestly made me never want to play with them again, he told me that I should stop making a scene and feeling sorry for myself, everyone's tired(while I was at work my friends went clubbing, apparently and the rest weren't very appreciative in the slightest) and that sort of broke the camels(bats?) back for me, every game we've played I've put in hours of prep time, printing stuff out, making characters for them cos none of them can be fucked to read the rules, I spent half of my paycheck on dice and rulebooks and this is what I get? That I'm making a scene? I know that being a DM is a thankless job, but at least I'd like to be appreciated for the work that I'm doing. What do you guys think?

The descriptions are taken from their respective store pages.

1. [Trail of Cthulhu](https://bundleofholding.com/store/Trail)

*Trail of Cthulhu* is a complete game of investigative horror set in the 1930s based on the work of H.P. Lovecraft. The game uses an adapted and enlarged version of GUMSHOE, a rules system that offers a laser-like focus on investigation and encourages characters driven to explore and investigate, even at the expense of their own health and sanity.

* *Sanity* measures your blissful ignorance of the true nature of reality, and *Stability* defines your mental health.
* Investigative abilities such as Cop Talk, Interrogation, and Occult help you find the awful crypt and maybe even tell you what you might find there; Drives such as *In the Blood* and *Arrogance* compel your character into that crypt at night; and General abilities such as Sense Trouble, Filch, and Scuffling get you out again.
* Tune the rules for Purist cosmic despair or lurid two-gun Pulp.
* This core rulebook includes three exciting campaign frames (tweedy academics, jut-jawed G-Men, and grimy traffickers in the eldritch) plus ""The Kingsbury Horror,"" a complete introductory adventure

2. [Soth: A game of Cultists vs. Investigators](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/163649/Soth-a-game-of-cultists-vs-investigators)

In *Soth*, you play cultists in a small-town, trying to summon a dark god. If you complete three more rituals, Soth will rise. But can you conceal your murderous crimes from family and friends?

It's a noir thriller that uses a diceless system to evaluate how suspicious the cultists are being. You then spend 'Suspicion' to put the cultists under pressure.

3.  [Cthulhu Dark](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/341997/Cthulhu-Dark)

""Cthulhu Dark is a tabletop roleplaying game of cosmic horror, in the style of H.P. Lovecraft.

It's about the things we fear, amplified until they are unbearable. It's about stories that genuinely creep you out, not well-worn tropes and creatures you've seen hundreds of times before.

And it's about bleak horror, in which humans are powerless when confronted by hyperintelligent alien horrors. You can't beat them. You can't fight them. You can only watch, run, hide and fear.

The rules are incredibly short: they're tightly focussed on horror and they drive the game.""

(From the DTrpg page)

4. [Kult: Divinity Lost](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/259252/Kult-Divinity-Lost--4th-Edition-of-Kult-Core-Rules)

In KULT: Divinity Lost, the world around us is a lie. Mankind is trapped in an Illusion. We do not see the great citadels of Metropolis towering over our highest skyscrapers. We do not hear the screams from the forgotten cellar where hidden stairs take us to Inferno. We do not smell the blood and burnt flesh from those sacrificed to long forgotten Gods. But some of us see glimpses from beyond the veil. We have this strange feeling that something is not right—the ramblings of a madman in the subway seems to carry a hidden message, and, when thinking about it, our reclusive neighbor doesn’t appear to be completely human when we pass in the hallway. By slowly discovering the truth about our prison, our captors, and our hidden pasts, we can finally awaken from our induced sleep and take control of our destiny.

**5. Delta Green**

*Born of the U.S. government’s 1928 raid on the coastal town of Innsmouth, Massachusetts, the covert agency known as Delta Green spent four decades opposing the forces of darkness with honor, but without glory. Stripped of sanction after a disastrous 1969 operation in Cambodia, Delta Green’s leaders made a secret pact: to continue their work without authority, without support, and without fear. Delta Green agents slip through the system, manipulating the federal bureaucracy while pushing the darkness back for another day—but often at a shattering personal cost.*

In *Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game,* you are one of those agents. You’re the one they call when unnatural horrors seep into the world. You fight to keep cosmic evil from claiming human lives and sanity. You conspire to cover it all up so no one else must see what you’ve seen—or learn the terrible truths you’ve discovered.

6. [Cthulhu Deep Green](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/295770/Cthulhu-Deep-Green?term=Cthulhu+Deep+Green)

Building upon the groundwork set out in Cthulhu Dark by Graham Walmsley, Cthulhu Deep Green contains modified rules set for playing as Agents of The Conspiracy: a shadowy government agency tasked with concealing evidence of the supernatural.

With a focus on quick setup and improvisational campaign play, the rules of Cthulhu Deep Green are designed to focus the human element while keeping the action tense and dramatic.

What will your agent give up to protect the public from terrors beyond sense or reason?

**7. Unkown Armies**

 *An occult game about broken people conspiring to fix the world.* 

*Unknown Armies* presents magick as it might exist in a world informed by crime fiction and secret histories, as twisting wrinkles in reality created by greater and greater risk, sacrifice, and obsession. **As a player,** you are confronted by the consequences of your character's actions and challenged by the implicit threat of a world shaped by the will of those who want something more than you do. 

*Book One: Play* is the book for players. It details:

* Obsession and identity.
* All of the rules for resolving actions.
* The central shock gauge mechanic.
* How to avoid fights, and how to deal with them when you're dragged into them anyway.
* The magick of adepts and avatars.

**8.  Never Going Home**

Never Going Home is a party-focused role-playing game set in horror haunted trenches during the First World War.

*Party-Focused:* Never Going Home uses the +One System to focus play and growth on what an individual character can do as part of the larger story that follows a group of soldiers called a Unit. Individual characters may depart regularly as they die from injuries or collapse into madness due to forces from beyond the Veil. Characters are quick to create, so players should expect to re-join the story portraying a new member of the Unit. Each character can have their own heroic moments, but the story of the Unit is the focus.  


*Horror-Haunted:* The Veil between worlds has been opened by the slaughter from the war; and the monstrous Whispers of beings wholly alien to humanity can now be heard. Some people have listened to the Whispers enough to gain arcane powers and now struggle to maintain control as their minds and bodies begin to change. Others are too far gone, mutated into barely-recognizable versions of their former selves. War consumes the days and monsters stalk the nights. Not even dreams are  
safe. Players manage their characters’ mental and emotional resources with a dwindling hand of cards.  


*The First World War:* The setting is the real Earth and the characters are all humans. A terrible new element has been added to the war, but the true horrors of the real war are part of the story as well. The game is set in the years between when the Veil was torn in 1916 and when the war really ended in 1918. The focus is on the front-line soldiers who are fighting and experiencing the worst of the magic and monsters. There is some mention made of, but little exploration of, the “home fronts” of any of the belligerents and civilians only appear in passing.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a085de50>,rpg,1644623034.0
db1vgy,Need an idea? Break something. Shatter it.,"
I’m always trying to think of problems that aren’t necessarily a monster, but something that looks like a small inconvenience, but ends up wrecking a place. Think about if a well gets poisoned. Ugh. Terrible. No source of potable water.

**But what if you could strip basic stuff from your setting that had major consequences that no one thought of?** 

Example: In this city and three miles out, fire doesn’t work all of a sudden. You can’t light a candle, torch, or anything. Oh, you try and cast a spell that has fire? Nope. Nothing. At night, the place is pitch black. Crime goes up. City watch is overwhelmed. People are panicked. A troll got into the city (they are hurt more by fire.) Something has to be done. But here are some of the hooks:

* Even more trolls show up. They somehow know that fire doesn’t work.
* The clerics that serve the deity of fire are sick or missing. Their entire chapel is gone as if it was never built.
* Perhaps the city has been shuttered (no one has left the city and no one has entered it).
* The mage tower that is miles away has a torrent of fire reaching up into the sky. Saddle up. 

Try taking an inconvenience and then stretching it out to a huge, huge problem. It’s easier than you think. (Metal starts rusting at a rapid rate. . . . Ooooooh.)

If you have a space game: somehow the form of travel around a certain planet has winked out. Everyone is stranded there. What’s hampering the ability to “warp out”? . . Or whatever your game calls it.

8zah52,"Unpopular opinion: I feel that traditional RPGs lead to stories that actually feel ""earned"", moreso than story games like PbtA/FATE","I'm not going to pretend like I'm an expert at narrative games, I DMed a selection with a varying number of play, so far I've run: Lady Blackbird, Dungeon World, Monster of the Week, FATE Accelerated, Monsterhearts (once and I prolly fucked it up), Undying, Apocalypse World 2e and Urban Shadows. Coming from DnD 5e I've wrenched myself from the usual trad rpg mindset and went to the ""play to find out what happens"" mentality that PbtA encourages in play. Even then I know there's still a lot of the philosophy to practice. However there was something that really bothered me, and that something pushed me to go back to 5e and now I wanna learn either SotDL or Pathfinder. I may not articulate it well but I'll try.
&nbsp

That something? It just feels like narrative games have so many moments that feel so inauthentic. Playing PbtA the general resolution mechanic is the 2d6 system (2 to 6 fails, 7 to 9 partial success, 10+ success), it helps speed play since it's so simple but at the same time it's so *general*. Moves flavor the game but the core is still core, and despite the chance for failure it feels less like thinking around the rules and more making a story. And that's probably the thing that irks me, as wonderful as story collaboration is it feels less like a game and more of a scriptwriting/acting session.
&nbsp;

I had thoughts of it before but I dismissed it as me probably just getting used to it. The pivotal moment was when one player said while we were playing DW that he wanted to ""jump down from the roof onto a building wall and wallrun towards the target and throw a dagger to cut down a rope holding up a street sign"". I was feeling kinda proud cos he was one of the skeptics who at first didn't understand how different DW was from DnD and I told him that players are encouraged to string actions together like in a movie, also that he gets to structure and materialize objects the world because it's collaborative. I made him roll for Defy Danger and then for Volley, both of which he got hard successes thanks to his dex.
&nbsp;

Afterwards we got to talking, I commended him on adapting but he goes on saying that he didn't feel like he earned it. He says that while it did feel like a cool scene he felt that he was badass as a Thief because he wanted to be, not because he actually was. His character wall-ran just because he said so and the sign existed because he said it was there, not because he rolled a good acrobatics check or because the sign was actually in a set environment I made. He compared it to the one time he was a Monk in 5e where everyone except him in the party was down vs 3 animated knights, he was down to one ki point but still managed to win via smart options, the environment (he brought a statue down on a knight) and a Nat20. 
&nbsp;

Despite the limitations of 5e compared to Dungeon World's freedom, that scene will be cooler and more hard-earned than any boss battle in a freeform story system. He was a clutch Monk because he did so and not because he said so. Behind the fixed HP, the somewhat rigid structure of the battlegrid, the mechanics was a chance to tell a story of a Monk who saved his party from death. Despite the chance of a partial success/fail, the walls of an AC to hit or an opportunity attack to risk was far more interesting to scale. That gave me pause.
&nbsp;

We still continued to play DW and Urban Shadows for a few more sessions, but eventually we went back to 5e and now eyeing Shadows of the Demon Lord, Pathfinder and 13th Age for new systems to try out. The group opened up and said and felt the same, and I find that we were happier making stories in less narrative and more crunchier systems. Rather than letting the act of pushing a story forward, the story happens organically as a result and byproduct of what we do in-game. 
&nbsp;

I'm not saying narrative games are bad, in the end it's up to what people prefer and how people go find their rpg fix. It's just that after some exploration I find that story games don't necessarily have the best stories as opposed to games without supporting mechanics. Narrative RPGs facilitate creating stories and they have tools for that, I just feel that if I wanted stories that actually have weight and came from places not from our imaginations but from the actions taken, I'd play traditional RPGs.

I *do* know of an amazing game store across the street from my college, and I do occasionally patronize them with my business, but not always, because I'm a broke college student and have to maximize my dollar. Sometimes. 

Support your local game store. If you want. They can be beautiful, vibrant places for the local community. But lots of folks are in this hobby and never step foot into game stores, and they do fine, and aren't heartless bastards for doing so. Insisting that we support LGSes as a rule is silly, because they are not uniformly great spaces for our hobby.

10pfx6g,I finally have to admit that OSR just isn’t for me,"I’ve had a fascination with the idea of OSR for a while now, but every attempt at getting into the actual games has been like bashing my head against a brick wall. Old School Essentials just feels like an overcomplicated mess. The Into The Odds and Mörk Borgs feel like empty skeletons. Every game I’ve looked at just leaves me feeling disappointed. And I think I’ve figured out why.

AD&D was my very first roleplaying game, but I always felt like I was fighting the system when I played it. I didn’t know of any alternatives, so I stuck with it until D&D 3e came out, and then I stuck with that until I discovered other games.

Over the years, I’ve read, played and picked apart tons of games. I was very engaged with the ideas and community surrounding The Forge and that school of game design, and in the years since then I’ve found that my niche in the rpg world is narrative, story-driven roleplaying games that offer systems and structure to support specific kinds of stories.

I’ve had this idea that OSR games offered that kind of structure in an indirect sort of way, by encouraging a type of gameplay based on improvisation and creative problem solving, while providing a framework for running an open-world style game centred around exploration and discovery, which it absolutely does.  
But for me, personally, it’s the wrong kind of framework. This became painfully obvious to me when I bought and read Into The Odd. I was very disappointed by it, because the book told me it was a game about weird, surreal adventures in a strange and hostile world, but what I found when I read it was a bare bones rpg system and nothing else. All the surreal weirdness was in the form of a few simple examples, and the game tells the GM to supply everything else without any support structure baked into the game at all.  
Theres nothing wrong with that, but it just doesn’t work for me. And that made me realize that to me, all OSR games are like that, and the entire OSR design philosophy feels kinda based around it.

The OSR style of design is trying to replicate a style of play that I have no nostalgia for, and that doesn’t work for me or provide what I want out of a roleplaying game.

And thats ok.  
It’s not for me, but I get the appeal. I’ve read about how rpgs were played in the early days, and how expectations and goals were very different. I can totally see how playing in one of those games would have been fun, and I know which parts of that style were discarded and which were brought forward into later games and design philosophies.  
It’s just not very appealing to me. And, again, thats ok.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a11e4950>,rpg,1675117150.0

* All the mental energy that can be expended when there is conflict, 99% of which can be mitigated by a straightforward and honest conversation

hv68b7,How much were gold coins really worth during the middle ages,"Just read an interesting article on [How much were gold coins really worth during the middle ages](https://talesoftimesforgotten.com/2020/03/18/how-much-were-gold-coins-really-worth-during-the-middle-ages/)

TL;DR its not easy to make a comparison as the economies are so radically different,  one Byzantine nomisma (bgp, 4.4g gold) had the purchasing power of about $400 (one pig) OTOH it was just over a months pay for a construction worker (\~$4000). 

I suspect that the latter figure is the more realistic, industrial methods have vastly reduced the cost of goods and materials. I think living standards may be the more relatable way to look at the value of gold in past times, something like 52g (12bgp)  would be enough for one person (maybe a family?) to live for a year ($48,000) in very modest comfort.

Looking to more modern times 

I also came across [www.victorianlondon.org](http://www.victorianlondon.org/index-2012.htm) with some interesting notes about [money](https://www.victorianlondon.org/finance/money.htm). This pegged a labourer at \~£40/year which is 290g (65bgp).

Getting interested I found [Lindert.pdf](http://www.nws-sa.com/rr/Inequality/Lindert.pdf) which has a table of Occupation annual pay (in £ = 1 sovereign = 7.3g pure gold) 

     Occupation 1755 1781 1797 1805 1810 1815 1819 1827 1835 1851 
     colliers   23   24   47   65   63   57   50   54   56   55  

So in the 18th and 19th coal miner would be earning 39-95bgp/year

[5th Ed](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Expenses#content) says a poor living standard is 2sp/day = 37(d&d)gp  = 308g gold = 70bgp/year 

So the bottom line is that D&D currency may be more comparable to prices during the Industrial revolution (in Briton) than the medieval period and you could use Victorian era catalogues to set equipment prices (£1 = 1gp would be roughly right). 

(Will add a link to a Victorian catalogue when I find one :-)",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a1270bc0>,rpg,1595333368.0

He comes running down the stairs and asks if he can borrow my Player's Handbook.  I bought the Player's Handbook on D&D Beyond the first week it came out and was on sale for $19.99 back in August 2017.

Since I use the paper copy all the time, I installed the D&D Beyond app on his iPad, logged in with my Twitch ID and tried to download the Player's Handbook.  And IT'S NOT THERE.  It wants me to buy it again, and the full price of $29.99.  The Monster Manual I bought is there, but the PHB is just gone.

I emailed D&D Beyond support, but I doubt anyone will look at this right away before the evening is over, so my son can start reading the PHB.

Don’t dictate, elaborate instead.

The game of life is hard to play, but it always takes precedence.

Rule Zero AKA The Rule of Cool AKA DM Caveat is a tool, not a weapon.

You must be the PC’s biggest fan and cheerleader. You do not exist as a pure adversary but rather as a challenge or teacher.

Any conflict must result in growth. 

Progress is measured not in time, space, or levels but in friendship and glory.

DO NOT TRY TO WIN THE GAME

Patience, patience, patience. 

Players can’t read minds. 

If PC’s struggle, step in. If PC’s walk with ease, step in. Be active. 

Spotlight control begins and ends with you.

PC’s must never be aware of the safety net. 

Heroes sometimes die. Idiots always die. 

Do not punish so much as teach. 

Do not hate them for their foibles but do not forget them.

Do not be too fond of a joke if said joke has teeth and murderous intent. 

If you are asked for advice, give it earnestly and without complaint. 

Hang on to good players with zeal. 

Dump bad players like rotten fish.

An honest accounting should be done to ensure everyone has time to play weaponized pretend. 

Character driven narratives require characters to drive them.

Small personal moments are just as essential as Michael Bay Explosions

Music, art, props, accoutrement are all appreciated but not necessary and often the imagination can trump anything you pull out.  

Good DMs borrow. Great DMs steal.

46lb8f,I just pulled off my best gotcha ever as a GM,"The campaign just ended last night, and I'm really proud of myself and wanted to share.  The arc of the campaign focused on the players trying to find the reason why the world was slowly fragmenting.  

After some running around, fighting some pirates, surviving the odd assassination attempt, and other typical D&D activities, the players somewhat unexpectedly come upon the Lich King, imprisoned at the bottom of a dungeon after being betrayed and overthrown by his own lieutenants some 500 years before.  The Lich King had long been assumed to have been the perpetrator of the fragmenting, but, he gleefully informs them, this is not the case.  The *last* thing he wants is for the world to be fragmented, because then he can't *conquer* it.  In fact, he continues, it's the Wizard-King of their own nation that's behind it all.  Their Wizard-King is so fearful of being overrun by enemies that he is willing to break the world apart in order to keep his country safe from anything that might harm it.  

So the players have an oh-shit moment, because this suddenly crystallizes a lot of details that up till now hadn't really made a lot of sense.  This is quickly followed by the sinking realization that the BBEG they are going to have to face is not only one of the most powerful men in existence, but one of their own countrymen.  [Note: The players specifically requested a gritty campaign with tough moral choices, so I gave it to them.]

Well, the Lich King says, I could transform you into some serious undead, and you'd be more powerful.  Powerful enough to take him on directly, yourselves.

The players say no.  One of them is tempted ... but no.

Okay, how about freeing me, then? the Lich King offers.  I would help you kill your Wizard-King, and I will give you my word that I wouldn't invade your nation ... at least until I'd conquered everything else.

The players say that it sounds tempting, but no.  We're going to have to try to find another epic power to ally ourselves with.  Someone safer.

The Lich King sighs.  Okay, well, he says, would you like an emissary of mine in case you need to corroborate your story?  The Lich King beckons and this ancient, decrepit ghoul shuffles forward.

The players say okay.

So for the next half dozen sessions, they haul this gimpy zombie-thing along with them, while gathering forces to confront the Wizard-King.  It never proves useful, but my players never throw anything away.  *Ever.*  So finally the showdown comes: fireballs are thrown, royal guards make ferocious last stands, and at last the Wizard-King falls to the floor, defeated and dying.

At which point the broken-ass ghoul they'd been carrying around hulks the fuck out.  No longer a broke, limping, ancient undead, it is now an 8-ft tall incarnation of murderdeath.  It starts walking toward the broken body of the Wizard King, ignoring everything else around it.  The players realize that it's going to siphon power from the Wizard-King and allow the Lich King to break free, and they are just about out of spells and healing potions.

At which point, I am smiling about the biggest smile I've ever smiled.  ""Really, guys?"" I say, pulling out the stat sheet for the monster.  ""You cut a deal with one of the most evil creatures in all of creation, and you didn't think he was going to betray you?  MUAHAHAHAHA.""

The look on their faces was awesome.

100ygj6,Is WotC misjudging the the distribution of casual vs. hardcore players who will spend money?,"We all know WotC plans to increase monetization of players specifically (as DMs/GMs spend most of the money on their products) inspired by the micro transaction monetization of AAA video games.

But it occurs to me that lots of people stick with TTRPGs precisely because, to them, it's a low-cost low-time investment hobby. What do you need to be a player? Maybe a core book and a set of dice? Your own miniature if you're super into your character? Some hardcore players might look down on them, but I think you really need these kinds of low-investment players to fill out the ranks and keep any TTRPG healthy in the long run.

And while your casual video game player might drop $3 here and $5 there on in-app purchases and have that add up over time without them even realizing it, are most casual players really going to do that for a tabletop game that they *might* get to play for five hours twice a month? Are they even going to log into WotC's app when it's not time for their game? There's not instant gratification of getting new items or an XP boost as in DLC for an actual video game that they can play whenever and for however long they want.

PS - I'm aware that many people here don't like DND, but I'm surprised by how many here seem to be completely \*uninterested\* in what the next edition will bring. Because as the single biggest game in the hobby by a wide margin, what happens with DnD will have knock-on effects for the rest of the industry, for better or worse.

I don't play 5e myself, but I am interested in the future of the hobby overall, will a rising tide lift all boats, as 5e seems to have done with interest for the hobby? If predatory monetization works for WotC, will other large TTRPG companies follow suit? (Remembering Chaosium jumping on NFTs.) If the next iteration of DnD  flounders, will this lead to an influx of players trying other games as an alternative, or will the playerbase dry up as the standard gateway game fails to garner new recruits for the hobby?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a2312840>,rpg,1672619990.0

While in Barnes and Noble today I brought my daughter to look at some DnD books.  I told her that it was a game about telling stories with dice.

After we got home she wanted me to play with her unicorn toys.  I suggested we use dice to tell our story.  The whole game was one of the most fun experiences she and I have had in a long time.  She made up a story about unicorns saving a forest from a t-Rex.  She even invented a magic spell, which is a magical crab claw that pinched the dinosaurs tail.

jh10eb,"Why Are the ""Dragonlance"" Authors Suing Wizards of the Coast?","On October 19, news broke that Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, the co-authors of the long-running *Dragonlance* series of novels, were suing Wizards of the Coast for breach of contract. The story swept across the Internet with no small number of opinions flying around about the merits of the suit, the *Dragonlance* setting, the *Dragonlance* novels, and Weis/Hickman themselves.

The Venn Diagram of lawyers and people who write about tabletop games is basically two circles with very little overlap. For the three of us who exist at the center, though, this was exciting news (Yes, much as I am loathe to talk about it, I have a law degree and I still use it from time to time). 

Weis and Hickman are arguably the most famous D&D novel authors next to R.A. Salvatore, the creator of Drizzt Do’Urden, so it's unusual to see them be so publicly at odds with Wizards of the Coast.

I’m going to try to break this case down and explain it in a way that makes sense for non-lawyers. This is a bit of a tall order—most legal discussions are terminally boring—but I’m going to do my level best. This is probably going to be a bit of a long one, so if you're interested, strap in.

1c1mtnq,I told my group I'm burnt out on dnd 5e during our over 2 years campaign. This is how it went.,"Recently I asked for tips on how to tell my 5e group that I am burnt out on dnd 5e as a system and our years long campaign in [this post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1bwsrky/tips_for_breaking_to_my_players_im_done_with_out/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

When I read such posts from other people I always think to myself ""hm, I wonder how it went..."". So here's how it went.

We met on a non-gaming night to welcome back and plan the return of a player who was on baby break for a while. Once we all set down and before anyone even poured themselves a drink or opened a beer, the players just kept chatting and telling anecdotes and epic stories from the campaign to catch up the returning player. It really did well to remind me how excited everyone still is and how invested they are into all these crazy events and NPCs and character developements that happened so far. Unknowingly they really amped up my own excitement again as well. Maybe we should meet without playing and just shoot the shit and chat about the game, rpgs in general and irl stuff more often.

Originally I planned to end the campaign after a few sessions to get it to a satisfying conclusion at the end of the current story arc / adventure. It was in that moment I decided that the campaign deserved another chance. But I am really just fed up with dnd 5e and need a break. Maybe after the break I'll be more excited again to continue even if the system likely won't ever be something I consider very good. 

So I spoke up, said I wanted to announce something and told them how I felt but focused on the positives and mentioned how awesome seeing everyone absolutely hyped for our campaign just then was. However I need a break from 5e and want to run like a half a year palette cleanser adventure in a different system and different setting for them after the current story arc concludes. 

And not only was everyone super understanding and agreed to do that. Once we talked about it people got really excited and suggested settings and systems and ideas. I took some notes on which genres, settings and types of games people want to play. All players are open to very different systems such as narrative, OSR or even more avant-garde stuff and many different genres from cyberpunk to low dark fantasy and even super heroes or wuxia games. So I will compile a very short list of games we'll pick from together once we hit the break point in the current game. After that I'll run at least one more story arc and then re-evaluate again. The players said that sounds great to have a change of pace after every or every other dnd adventure. 

TL;DR: I will give the campaign another chance even though 5e doesn't excite me anymore. But everyone was more accepting and even excited to try new things. Having the most amazing people play at my table admittedly helps. Maybe my experience encourages some people in a similar situation to speak up to their group.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a24a0c80>,rpg,1712861253.0

agd1hg,I had my worst experience ever,"Consider this a cautionary tale for all the new DMs here.

*Mandatory apology for grammar mistakes since English isn't my main language*

&#x200B;

Last weekend I went to the weirdest birthday party ever: there was a piñata, an amateur pole-dancing contest and D&D 3.5 campaign. Guess which one I chose? ^(on insight, I should've opted for the pole-dancing)

The DM was the friend of a friend and he had a premade 3.5 campaign to teach new players the ropes of RPG. Since he knew I play D&D, he asked me to join it to guide the rest of the party and I was more than happy to comply. 

I don't want to turn this post into a cringefest, so I'll sum up some of the highlights:

* The DM ridiculed the new players' decisions and asked me if that's what I would do if I were them.
* The Elf was scammed out of her infravision and even lost HP for stumbling on things in the dark. (she was a new player and didn't know she even had infravision to being with, when I pointed that out, the DM just said that he never told us we had special skills, so we didn't have them)
* We weren't allowed to delay our actions
* We were forced to use a full round actions to load light crossbows
* The new players were monkey pawed on every single action they made (Player A wanted to gather wood for a fire, DM told him that after an hour, he gathered a big pile of wet wood, even though there wasn't a dice roll to determine the success)
* NPCs were used to humiliate the new players, they mocked all the PCs choices that didn't go along with the DM's plans.
* If a player didn't describe what they wanted to do in a way that fully pleased the DM, they were forced to roll a d12 instead of a d20 for skill checks. (I don't know if the difficulty also changed accordingly, but I don't think so)
* The scenario changed to better suit the DM's desire to torture us (we got stranded in the sea in the middle of the night, the Druid wanted to use the stars as guidance, it was suddenly sunrise and we couldn't see stars in the sky. Better for us, we can use the sun, right? Nope, now a dense fog covers the ocean, we can't tell where the sun is.)
* The DM literally smirked and said ""now it's my turn to get some fun"" when we stumbled upon a freaking Necromancer and 6 skeleton soldiers in the middle of a ritual. (we were LV1 and hadn't had our full rest yet)

That's when I decided it was getting late (it really wasn't) and I called an Uber and went home.

I don't know how the game ended, but I know that it was a very frustrating experience for those new players and I wouldn't be surprised if they never play TTRPGs ever again.

So if you're an inexperienced DM, please, PLEASE, remember that we're supposed to have **fun** together. Even in CoC, players *have fun* while dealing with cosmic horrors and facing insanity. If you want to make people suffer, go play The Sims or write a horror novel.  End of rant.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a2710740>,rpg,1547584936.0

vjnkwt,Playing D&D In Ukraine: Better And Worse At The Same Time,"Hi there, welcome to a day in my life. 

We're still in Ukraine, we're still alive, we're still into tabletop roleplaying games. How does it work out for us? Well, you see...

Living in a time of war gives you motivation. You want to, nay, you *need* to do something, because things are very wrong, and when things are very wrong, doing nothing might just drive you crazy. 

So, for the sake of preserving your sanity, you find something to do. You take a look at those old books you've long wanted to re-read, you think of things that you can borrow from the books to make your game more fun. You write up a character idea that you'd love to play out. 

You dive into your elf-game and you fight against monsters, you sneak past enemies,  you find treasures, you save kingdoms or you break kingdoms. You vent. Call it escapism if you like, but it's something that lets you put your emotions in check. 

And once you do that, you can think rationally and you can do something that's helpful for your people and your country. Which our group totally does. 

This is the *better* part. But there's also the *worse* part.

Normally, there's this nice little reserve of energy that helps you deal with minor problems. This guy likes the system that is objectively bad (it's incredible how often things that we don't like are objectively bad), this girl wants to play an undead ninja with a tragic backstory and complex psychological issues, *again*, and these two can't stop goofind around and do one serious reasonable thing if their characters' lives depended on it. You know, the kind of problems that people write about on reddit and other people always tell them to *bloody talk to their players like bloody adults* and it's usually the right thing to do. 

You talk about it, and introduce a couple homerules that make the system objectively better (seriously, everyone likes it), and the undead ninja's backstory now has some really interesting elements that are going to tie in nicely to the plot, and these two? Let them goof around, a game is no good without some laughter. 

That's what you do normally. 

You can't do it when things go wrong. That little reserve of energy is not there anymore, you've used it up just to keep living and not panic and not run around screaming. The minor problems suddenly become issues that hurt you, that you can't really deal with because it's too much. You don't have the strength to talk to people about those issues. It's easier to just shrug and move away and say ""you know, I'll probably skip the next session"". 

Maybe next week you'll feel better and you'll be able to talk to people and resolve the issues. 

Maybe by that time, things will get a little better and you'll feel a little less stressed. 

You really don't want to think that things might get a little worse, or a lot worse. 

But if they do, you know you'll just have to do something.

9exb9r,Unpopular Opinion and PSA: Stop telling people not to run certain games for new players,">It's 1981. You and your friends are bored twelve year olds. Steve, who's parents are really cool, bought him Dungeons and Dragons, and Steve spent a day or two reading over the rulebook. Steve has invited you and your friends over to his house to play the game. He explains the gist of it and you have a good time. Or you don't. The point is, a bunch of twelve year olds played Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. 

One of the common threads on this sub, a frequently asked question if you will, is ""New GM, what should I run?"" or some variation of ""Want to introduce my friends to x game, advice?"". Now, in the case of the first question, ""What should I run for the first time?"" everyone of course is going to recommend one of their own favorite games. 

Regarding the second question, ""I want to introduce my friends to a game that I already play. Do you have any advice?"".

Dozens upon dozens of different users on this sub have responded with some variation of ""Try a rules-lite RPG first, particularly this one that _I_ really like. Your game is too complicated for new players.""

I mean this is the nicest way possible: that's condescending. It's frankly insulting. Children used to figure out how AD&D, _AD&D_, worked for the most part. If we didn't do things based on perceived complexity, no one in the world would have started playing D&D to begin with, because there were easier games to play at the time. If you play Shadowrun weekly with friends, you don't need to stop playing Shadowrun in the name of the new guy/gal, because _everyone was new to the game at some point_. 

Anytime someone mentions ""new players"" next to the words ""Pathfinder"", ""Shadowrun"", or ""GURPS"", there's inevitably going to be somebody claiming that new players simply cannot possibly understand what's going on. 

I'm not claiming that someone can gain rules mastery within an  hour or a session or even a few sessions, I'm saying that anybody can learn any game, we were all new at some point, and frankly introducing people who haven't played any kind of RPG before to storygames is just as weird as crunchy games. 

Plenty of us got our starts in these systems, just as plenty of you got your start in whatever game your friends happened to be playing at the time. 

And I'm sorry that this came across as a bit of a rant, but I'm real tired of seeing this here and in other gaming forums. I think the only ""advice"" that makes me more offended than this is the implication that if you play D&D or another tradgame, you'll eventually move on because ""you just don't know that D&D isn't actually that fun.""

End rant. If you could just consider the way you word things a little more carefully, that would be great guys. Just remember that we all share a hobby, which is why we're all here. Sure, some of us like moving minis around on a map to kill things and some of us prefer pretending to be highschool werewolves dealing with their sexual identities, the point is, an RPG is an RPG. Don't shoot down someone else's good time, just be happy that your hobby is expanding. Thank you for your time.

**Edit**: As has been pointed out below, there is no black and white way of looking at this. My ""advice"" looks good on paper, but of course there are going to be some people who just don't jive with your game. Maybe there's one thing tripping them up, maybe they honestly don't get the system, maybe they're uncomfortable roleplaying, and a thousand other maybes.

I want to clarify here that I was not trying to attack rules-lite systems either, I enjoy quite a few of them myself. And I will concede that there is probably a difference between running a one shot just for some curious people, and for someone who you are trying to convince to join your gaming group.

As usual, folks are up in arms and this time it's in some part my fault. The point I was trying to make was that you should run what feels fun and good for you. Sometimes that won't work out, and that's fine. I'm sure a lot of us have seen outlier cases on both sides of the fence. 

After saying all that, I'd say the point I was *trying* to get across was:

>Don't shoot down someone else's good time, just be happy that your hobby is expanding.

But....why the focus is ALWAYS on the GM side? Why there are so few ""how to be a great player"" guides and videos on YouTube?

The GM is expected to know the rules, has to do several different voices and be a second Oscar winning actor.....while most players are there, don't roleplay/ act at all (funny that Matt Mercer gets all the credit when the players at CR are doing a great ""job"" as well), don't have to speak in different Voices/tone for their character, play on the phone during sessions or really don't listen

We as the GMs are working for the session preparing adventures (pre written or self-made) .....and players then critique ""well the didn't GM well""

Edit: let's say it simpler

While players always argue online how bad ""that"" GM was and like a better GM like in CR

Why don't they play their characters like the players in CR? The rules don't have something to do when you see some session of heavy roleplay in character

But it seems that for most Reddit users player engagement and ""working together for a great session"" is either something new or is not in the rules as long as the GM is not good",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a2a94710>,rpg,1679655862.0

k9clsf,Update: D&D 45th Anniversary Sapphire Dice Set: manufacturing defects and poor returns,"[Original found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/k319wt/dd_45th_anniversary_sapphire_dice_set/)

To recap: I ordered the WotC 45th anniversary dice set back in September, got a damaged set in October and returned them and have had the runaround trying to get a replacement set or any information on when they might come since. After my post on r/dndnext  blew up, I got a message from Mike Mearls offering to look into the issue and to try to get a replacement set for me.

Unfortunately, after a week+ has now passed with no further word from Mike or WotC support (I did ping him on 12/2 to what he'd heard, but only got a short ""nothing yet - hope to hear something soon"" in reply), I've thrown in the towel. After an email asking for a refund rather than a replacement went unanswered, I contacted my credit card company for a dispute/chargeback. Hopefully I'll at least have a provisional credit back to me before Christmas so I can spend my money elsewhere.

To be honest, the whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth regarding WotC. For the amount being charged for these (insane, I know -this was a purchase only on my part due to both a windfall for my wife and I, and this having been a pretty big milestone career anniversary they were purchased for), I would have expected them to come unblemished, and for returns to be more customer friendly (I know there are extenuating circumstances with Covid, but this has dragged on far too long, and the lack of replies to my later emails has been frustrating to say the least). I super appreciate Mike reaching out and making an attempt to make things right, but if even he can't get so much as a reply from the returns people after a week, I'm afraid I have little faith in WotC or it's ability to get this fixed or provide a set worth what was paid for them (ie, undamaged).

1isd218,Is Dungeons and Dragons currently behind a $200 paywall?,"EDIT:  I'm clearly using ""paywall"" incorrectly here....I ought to have said ""buy in"".

EDIT EDIT: I'm not looking for alternative games or cheaper ways to play D&D, just looking to discuss the vibes.

And if so, why is it still so ubiquitous?  I keep toying with the idea of getting back into Dungeons and Dragons, and maybe even playing it online, but the ""official"" experience of owning all three books and playing online with DnDBeyond feels like it would be at least a $200 up front buy in.  Is my impression correct?  I'm sure there are ways to cheapen it up, but it's really hard for me to grok that this is not only the most well known game, but is it now the most ""elite"", or ""executive experience"" in roleplaying games?

Fun fact:  I'm really old, so I may be Grandpa Simpsoning this thing....I'm sure back in my AD&D days we spent WAY more than $200 of 1970/80s money on the game....but it never felt that way.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a414a240>,rpg,1739886506.0

go0t2q,Worst DM Habit That Turns You Off as a Player?,"It's not easy being a DM, but some behaviors are more tolerable than others. So I thought I'd ask folks around here, what is something that you've learned to take as a big red flag, and to duck out before frustrations mount?

One of the things I've found is that a DM who wants to make big, sweeping changes to a game's established setting or rulebook often does so to curtail player freedoms, but without just straight up asking players to narrow their character concepts to fit a certain theme. Someone who doesn't want a bunch of casters nerfs magic, someone who wants exclusively casters hamstrings rogues and fighters, etc.

A perfect example for me was a guy who was running a Werewolf: The Apocalypse game I got invited to. Talked a big game about how player freedom and choice mattered, but every time I'd try to do something (run a ritual that he'd approved on my theurge's sheet, try to use a gun in combat since it's a modern game, etc.), I got my wrist slapped. Because he was not running the game the way it was written in the book, and since I couldn't read his mind I had no way of knowing what changes he'd made to the setting. Eventually I just threw up my hands and left, because I'd located enough of the invisible walls he'd put in place to see that he wasn't going to allow anything other than his preferred way of running werewolves, and that was not a game I was willing to play.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a43e9bb0>,rpg,1590080977.0

For a number of reasons I won’t get into I no longer want to run dnd 5e. However whenever I pitch other games this friend gives huge push back and basically goes to “buy you can homebrew that in 5e”. No matter the mechanics, setting, theme, etc. 

I got the pathfinder starter set and have been dying to run it. The rest of my group is either very excited or happy to try it with an open mind.

7x8wgg,"My personal tips and house rules for people wanting to GM ""Everybody is John""","[**Rules**](https://imgur.com/ueKNhc3)

Everybody is John is a fantastically fun and hilarious game to GM for almost everybody, from the hardcore Shadowrun player to someone who scoffs at the mention of ""Dungeons and Dragons"" because it's too nerdy. It is legitmately one of my favorite party games because of it. However, it can be pretty hard to GM, largely because so much can be going on with so many people, and that there is only one character. To help people run it, here are my tips:

**The two big ones:**


Everybody is John is supposed to be fun, funny, very freeflow, and extremely chaotic. Run it as such. Don't go too hard on the rules if something is going to be fun/funny, and try not to let people be rules lawyers, as that can make the game less fun for everyone else.

Be detailed. I, and my players, find that details make the game more vibrant and fun. John doesn't break into a ""car"", he breaks into a ""red 1986 Honda Civic with a blue door"". He doesn't find a ""handgun"", he finds a ""Beretta 92 with 12 bullets left in the magazine"". John didn't find ""some drugs"", he found ""7/16 of a pound of cocaine"". Give players indepth information and they'll get more involved.

**Smaller tips:**

Don't give them too much equipment to start out with. Make them play for things like guns, drugs, and cars. My limits for starting equipment is usually 200 in cash and clothing. I also never start them out with any sort of ID, as personal choice.

Keep inventory and afflictions lists. These are usually pretty fun to read at the end, and lets you as GM know exactly how beat up is John.

Related to afflictions, treat John as if he can't feel pain and nothing short of death or losing limbs will stop him doing John things.

I usually avoid having John start in ""situations"" for me he often wakes up in the back of a busted car, in a shitty bed, or on a bench somewhere.

Give John illegal but not overpowered items, forcing your players to come up with ways of getting out of difficult places, such as getting pulled over by the cops.

Use a John voice. For convincing people, I have my player say what they want John to say, then repeat it to them in my John voice. Mine's like an drunk 3 pack a day Joker, but do whatever you want.

Use a d6 for loot generation if they're looking for stuff. A 6 is a lot of useful things, guns, drugs, car keys, etc. 2 is nothing, 1 is usually a rodent that bites them, with variations in between.

Make NPC names dumb. EX: ""You have stole the large Hispanic man's wallet. There is 3.50 in change, and a driver's license with the name Jeph Zooplegoit.""

**My House rules**

I have minimum willpower bids of 1. You cannot bid less than 1, it is not allowed.

Stimulant drugs add 1 to all rolls for 4 turns, and alcohol adds 1 to people skills and takes away 1 for fine motor control. John looses this bonus after 12 hours or sleeping. If players are consecutively doing drugs, GM roll a dice for risk of overdose.

Only way to lose control of John is failing an important roll, my John doesn't get hurt, feel pain or get bored during periods of nothing.

Since players will lose control less often, after 2 or 3 hours of playing time, players no longer get willpower back after John sleeps, this is to avoid having games drag on for too long.

During long periods of travel, like walking somewhere or driving, instead of John getting bored and losing control I roll 3d6 for random encounters to keep him not bored.

afj2ja,What Pokemon Taught Me About Worldbuilding,"In appreciation of a huge part of my childhood, I'm going to talk about the tips and tricks you can use from Pokemon. 

1. Episodic Adventuring
--

* Set yourself up for an easier time prepping by using an episodic structure. This will allow you to have generalized ideas of your world as a whole while only focusing on one location per session. 

* It stops you from having the ""open world"" vs. ""linear story"" discussion because there isn't one with an episodic story. 
* Each episode is linked, but how they are linked can be handwaved as traveling. 
* The direction of travel isn't as important because you are essentially resetting the party's footing with each session. 

* It creates a definite end and beginning to each session. Each session begins with the party coming to a place, or experiencing something new. Each episode ends with them moving on. 

2. Build the map as you go
--

* You have your starting town and your first adventure, plus you have your list of ideas that sound cool. 
* At the end of each session you can lay out some rumors for the party to choose from. 
* When they pick one, just place that as the next spot on your ""map"". No fuss, no hassle. 
* After 9 or 10 sessions you'll have a whole region mapped out. 

3a Theme
--

* In the World of Pokemon, there is a core theme. Capture pokemon, battle them to become stronger, become the ""very best"". 
* This is a goal and an attainable one. 
* What is the core theme of your world? Boiling your world down to an idea this basic can free you up to explore ideas that are not complete in your head. 
* You don't need to know why the nations are at war if your theme boils down to: go to town, capture base, win the war. 
* Everything else can come from that and you can give your party this information as a pitch. If they're in, they're in. If not, try the next idea.

3b Location Theme
--
* Instead of focusing on the minutiae of worldbuilding, when it comes to new locations in Pokemon, each one is based around its *own* theme. 
* In Pokemon, each gym has its specialty, and from that specialty, the town grows. The rock town is rough and stoic. The ghost town is spooky and horrifying. 
* Use those random ideas you have to be the fuel to flesh out the locations of your world. 
* If we continue with the war example, you might have a list that includes: the horrors of war, the downward spiral, losing a friend, letters from home. 
* Each of those will be a location in your world: a fresh battlefield where shellshocked soldiers call for the party's help, a wasteland where the weirdness of war pull at the party's sanity, a makeshift gravesite where the party faces their fallen comrades, a base with working water/comforts and a mailbox.

4a Enemies
--

* The World Theme creates the enemies. 
* In Pokemon, it's other trainers. 
* In this War World (which I'm starting to grow fond of) it's the opposing army. 
* You don't need to know everything about them, just that they are on the opposite side of your Party. 
* They fight against the party because of the Theme. 
* They oppose the party to fulfill the theme.

4b Recurring
---
* Recurring enemies creates fondness, understanding, and something *other*. 
* Just like a player can learn about their character by experiencing various situations and reacting to them, so can we learn about the enemy by experiencing them every session. 
* And not a group of faceless nobodies. But people with faces and names. 
* In Pokemon, it's Jesse and James. 
* In this War World, it might be the seductress who is a double agent, or an opposing sniper who radios in to taunt the party. 
* It's through repeated exposure that relationships and life are brewed. 

5. Random Encounters
--

* In Pokemon, between each of gym battles, the gang has an encounter. Usually out in the woods, or on the road. 
* These are just random encounters, and random encounters done right. Each one is impactful and lends itself to the overall theme. 
* Each one involves the gaining of a pokemon, the battling of some strange trainer, the accomplishment of some bonding exercise, or the thwarting of the enemy trying to steal your power. 
* In the War World, the random encounters could be POWs, a ruined village with survivors, mortar attacks, ambushes, a strange adventure where you have to dress fancy and mingle at some benefit. 
* Create a list of 10 ideas and use that as your springboard for random encounters. 

6. Re-imagining the old
--

* Pokemon is just a homebrew DnD world where the spells are living and wizards capture them to battle and grow stronger. 
* You can create a fresh spin for *your* world just be fluffing something old (spells) as something new (pokemon). 
* What if all monsters were just people, the name in the monster manual was their nickname? 
* What if all the races were actually animals (humans are dogs, elves are cats)? 
* What if dragons are just ideas that you can be infected with?

1aixz6,Recently uncovered a Chekhov's gun four years in the making. Anyone's GM ever keep a HUGE secret for  LOOOONG time?,"My GM, possibly the best GM in the history of GMs, runs a game of Legend of the Five Rings. Setting: Sorta-Samurai in Sorta-Japan.

This is long but hopefully worth your time.

Thanks partly to a PC math error, our little world got invaded by the Moon. Long story, but the Moon is a deity in this universe. His forces begin with a few cultists, but eventually recruit a bunch of ronin, and soon we have actual defectors from the great samurai clans fighting for the enemy.

Factions form, split, reform. Long-dead threats rise to take their piece of the pie. Enormous battles ensue.

My party's job is to gather a group of what amounts to demigods in order to put an end to all this madness. It is a crappy job. High turnover rate. Thankfully, our benevolent GM came up with a new healing potion sold at a recently opened chain store we could find in almost any town. Due to his love of Engrish, he named the potion ""White Pearl Super Big Power.""

It's kind of expensive, but heals better than almost anything else on the market, and replenishes all your spent Void points (points you burn for an extra 1k1 on anything, among other benefits).

We started stocking up on this early on, using it very quickly, then running back to the store to get more. We use it to replace sleep, since sleep only heals you 1/3 as much.

The stuff works instantly, so a common maneuver in combat is to spend a round getting to a downed (useful) comrade and dumping a bottle of it down his throat, then leaving him with a few more so he can finish healing and get back up and fight. A round lasts about five seconds in-game, so this amounts to getting knocked unconscious for ten seconds, spending fifteen seconds or so shaking it off, then getting up and fighting at near-full capacity.

Crowning achievement: in combat, one PC figured out how to break physics with his bandoleer of these bottles:

1. Drink a White Pearl to heal some HP and get all his Void back.

2. Spend a Void to gain another action for the round.

3. Repeat until fully healed.

*And our GM allowed it.* (He did have this guy mind-raped by a miniboss immediately afterward as a not-so-subtle hint that maybe this sort of thing would draw the attention of our opponents. We occasionally do it anyway.)

I cannot even imagine how many gallons of this stuff we've ingested as we've trod through this worsening war, watching whole cities fall to the Moon, our centuries-old way of life obliterated, but knowing we need to live to fight another day, even if victory will be hollow by the time we achieve it.

Eventually we bought so much of this stuff that our GM had his little chain store start selling subscription bottles. We bought those, used them up in a day, and came back for refills.

Over the course of *four real-life years*, getting together anywhere from weekly to monthly, we marched through this campaign. Not one original party member remains, but we always swear in the new guys to continue fighting the good fight. And always, always, we stay stocked with White Pearl Super Big Power.

A week ago, my character, having suffered several concussions, and being out of his White Pearl, held the empty glass bottle up to the sky one evening to see if there was a single drop left in it. There was.

It was exactly the same color as the moon.

hedx78,Using Disorders in RPGs,"Please, please educate yourselves before using any disorder with your character in a game. As someone with a very stereotyped and stigma carrying disorder (OSDD-1b which is on the spectrum of Dissociative Identity Disorder), seeing posts and stories of characters with mental illness done wrong can cause a lot of pain especially when others pick up on how that player and DM incorporated that disorder as how it is in real life. Many of these disorders can be and are handled wrong. Please don’t base these things off the media, such as basing Dissociative Identity Disorder off of Split, and think that’s how it is. Giving a character a disorder can be interesting and add a lot to the game especially with things like PTSD/C-PTSD, but if you go with the stereotypes and misinformation it can lose that complex and interesting value and also do a lot of damage you might not realize even if it’s just something in your group.

PTSD isn’t just what they show in the media, there are several types of flashbacks that aren’t just full flashbacks. You can have emotional flashbacks and physical flashbacks. You can have no flashbacks at all and just have nightmares. Look at Caleb on Critical Role, he has PTSD and I think it’s done wonderfully. He doesn’t have violent fits when having a flashback like they show in the media, but he is good representation of PTSD, in my opinion, done well in dnd. 

Dissociative Identity Disorder, formerly Multiple Personality Disorder, and OSDD, Otherwise Specified Dissociative Disorder, are complex disorders that are often covert to the point the host, the primary alter (not personality the term is alter) who takes care of daily life, might not find out they are part of a system until they are in their sixties. There is a lot more to these disorders than just alters. DID forms when a child undergoes extreme and severe repeated trauma that is often repeated abuse. These people are not dangerous or violent like the media portrays. They are often scared children trapped in memories of trauma, people living a life that isn’t their own, animals inside humans bodies, and so much more that the brain of this individual grabbed from around them to cope with what they were going through. People with DID are not like the people who hurt them, they are not dangerous or violent.

There are so many more disorders I have seen and heard of being portrayed badly in dnd games and I only touched on the two I know the most of that are very much colored by the media. Now, this is not me saying don’t use mental disorders for your characters, I think that using them with characters can be a great learning tool for educating yourself on mental illness, but please don’t use mental illness with characters in your dnd games unless you educate yourselves. People share stories of their games which influences other people and their characters or games. So as someone with a very stereotyped disorder that holds a lot of stigma due to misinformation from the media, please please educate yourselves before adding a mental illness to your characters.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a5498c20>,rpg,1592916182.0
1c94jsl,"*Update* My son saved my life with 40K and D&D, trying to figure out how to thank him","This post seemed to gain a bit of traction. I tried updating it by replying to it, but no one seemed to seethe reply. I am bad at reddit. So I will update here, and if you're interested, you can read the original.

I ended up sending my son a text. I told him that I enjoy the time I get to spend him with these days, but when his mom and them left, it was the thing that really kept me going. I thanked him and told him I appreciate him. I didn't manage to get out an ""I love you"" . I told him he didn't need to reply. he never did.

But he did come over for roast chicken tonight, and he showed me how to not suck quite so much at Dark and Darker, so I assume he got the message and he's not feeling too awkward to be around me. Thanks guys! Old post below.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I honestly didn't know where to post this, but I needed to get it off my chest.  
  
A few years ago during covid, my marriage and my life fell apart. It had always been rocky, but one day out of the blue I come home to find that my house had been completely trashed, my kids had moved out with their mom, and I was left alone. To make matters worse, I had lost my job and had a hard time finding another one due to the epidemic. I was actually, at 43 years old, making sandwiches at Publix. So here I am, no money, no kids, in a trashed house with even my pets gone. And I have some chronic health problems that due to not having insurance, were going untreated. I was falling apart mentally and physically.  
  
I honestly considered suicide, but I could never do it because of my kids.  
  
My son was into 40K and he said that he wanted to start playing on the weekend. I managed to get an eBay credit card and lucked out finding a fully painted space marine force for 300 bucks. Every Saturday we would go to lunch and then to the game store to play. His new stepdad was pretty well off, so he was always playing different armies, but I played my space marines.  
  
I was so poor that sometimes the rest of the week me and my new cat would share eggs for dinner. He never said anything, but he started paying for his own lunch. Then he would buy kits here and there for my favorite army, Orks. He would build them. He said it was so he could have someone to paint with.  
  
Eventually I found a decent job and got mentally well enough to start putting my home together again (I won the home in the divorce, which is another story. I deserved it). I started my old D&D game back up. People would come and go, but he was there every other week. Never missed a game unless he was out of town.  
  
Cut to now, I have a very good paying job, a wonderful girl that I plan to marry, and am happy, if a bit scarred. He still comes over to play and paint, and he makes sure I go to the gym with him four days a week as well.  
  
We don't talk about feelings. We don't hug. I don't know how much of this was a plan to help me or just spend time with me, and how much of it was him wanting to play games. If I tried to thank him, I know he would freeze up and wouldn't be able to talk.  
  
I want to thank him for saving my life but I don't know how. I have literally opened my mouth to say something a dozen times and couldn't get the words out.  
  
(edit) I should add that my girlfriend is a huge part of this as well. Most of the rebuilding was due to her help. I just left her out because I don't have issues thanking her and telling her how I feel, but she is as awesome as he is.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a54ac7d0>,rpg,1713658213.0
mqmmdx,"Honey, some dudes with guns are at the door. They want you to run D&D and only D&D for the rest of your life (apparently)","There's a type of post that crops up quite a bit in this and other TTRPG subs and it goes a little something like this:

""I have been running a D&D campaign for a while now. I started out as a player but when the DM had to drop out  I stepped up on an interim basis and now it's five years later. 

Don't get me wrong, I like D&D just fine, it's just that I would love to run something different. However, every time I bring up the possibility of running Call of Cthulhu or World of Darkness my players start moaning, rocking back and forth, foaming at the mouth, and rending their own flesh with fingers so gnarled and blackened by anger that they have come to resemble talons. 

Is there any way I can get them to maybe consider trying something different? I'm just tired... So very very tired.""

How common is this problem? Is it relatively new?

I ask as my experience has always been that running the game means that you have a good deal of leeway when it comes to deciding upon which games get run. 

Now, obviously there's always going to be a bit of back-and-forth and having your group enjoy a particular game means that you're naturally going to be more enthusiastic about running that game but I get the impression from this sub and others that people will just dig their heels in and point blank refuse to even try other games.

The reference to dudes with guns showing up at the GM's house is a reference to the faint undertone of menace that always pervades these posts. GMs desperately trying to keep on the good side of the guy with the gun. 

Is this real? Have people experienced having their group implode or just not turn up rather than trying something new?

Has the social contract between GM and player changed or are people just more fearful of losing whatever group they have (particularly under lockdown)?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a5598890>,rpg,1618390644.0

cofwz8,Flashback is an RPG where you develop your character by adding to their backstory and building personality traits,"[Flashback](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flashbackrpg/flashback-rpg-a-roleplaying-game-about-changing-history) is an indie RPG project that began as a way to help new players build more interesting backstories for their characters.

We wanted to give first-time players a reason to go beyond identifying themselves simply by their race, class and weapon of choice (or worse, a table full of dark mysterious strangers with amnesia). In Flashback, players must justify their skills by explaining how they acquired their abilities in the past: as they are about to perform a task, they have the opportunity to tell a story about their history to the rest of the table. This means that every situation is packed with roleplaying and character growth - even in the middle of combat you are encouraged to develop your character.

What’s more, you get to reveal your character’s backstory gradually and give others a chance to contribute ideas. Players build on each other’s concepts and the GM gets an endless source of material to connect players to the world and ongoing narrative. From there, Flashback grew around the central idea of providing real incentives for roleplaying instead of just an afterthought. The next innovation came with the idea of defining your character through personality traits instead of physical attributes.

The Personality Trait system is based on the same traits that psychologists use to model the human psyche. It’s mind over matter - your physical and mental attributes are actually influenced by aspects of your personality. You might be physically strong because your *Disciplined* nature helps you to focus and train hard. You might be vigilant and perceptive because your *Skeptical* outlook makes you question every tiny detail.

By putting the focus on your character’s internal nature instead of their external stats, players always have roleplaying at the forefront of their thoughts. What’s more, your power and advancement are directly tied to the expression of your character’s personality. It’s good to be a little Stubborn sometimes - nobody respects a pushover - but if you try to min-max your personality then the other characters will probably start to find you difficult and abrasive.

We've received some very positive [reviews](https://www.indieuncovered.com/tabletop/flashback-rpg-preview/) and [feedback](https://thecampaignermagazine.com/2019/07/flashback-preview/), and we really hope Flashback will encourage players to discover the joy of roleplaying in RPGs. You really just need to unlearn the idea of being a passive player and embrace the ""everyone is a storyteller"" idea.

There's just 1 day left to get [Flashback RPG on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flashbackrpg/flashback-rpg-a-roleplaying-game-about-changing-history)! Thanks for supporting indie RPGs like us!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a60867b0>,rpg,1565428812.0

5oyyoj,How to Run RPGs for Busy Adults,"Hey gamers, I turn 40 this year and, if there's one thing I've learned about trying to keep a gaming group together recently, it's that running RPGs for busy adults is challenging. Here are some tricks I've learned for how to make it all work:

**1)** Run it less like *Lord of the Rings* and more like a *Star Trek* television series. Instead of writing adventures where 4-6 specific characters go on an epic quest that spans a dozen game sessions, try to keep each adventure to one game session. You can have an ongoing story, but instead of ""take this ring back from whence it came"" it's more like ""these are the voyages.""

**2)** Let each player maintain multiple characters, but only play one at a time. That way, if you do have an adventure that requires multiple sessions, but some players can't make it to all the games, you can put those stories on hold and do one-shot sessions with different characters from each player's portfolio. This also gives you a chance to mix up different personalities for interesting results.

**3)** To facilitate point #2 above, keep all the characters in the same organization so their comings and goings are easier to manage. Whether it's Starfleet, the Pathfinder Society, the X-Men, or the Camarilla of Chicago, it helps tie the players together and keep the adventures episodic. Introductions are simple and it's easier to align each character's objectives from adventure to adventure.

**4)** Embrace the full power of modern technology! Start a Facebook page for the group to keep track of everything. Use a free online blog to keep track of previous adventures, the status of the group, and what's on the schedule. Since your time is so precious (and often short) for actual gaming, try to put as much paperwork, planning, and downtime activity as possible there or in email. If you get the group together for a game, don't waste a second of it leveling up, deciding who's going to GM, or what everyone wants on their pizza - do all that online before or after the game!

The result of using these points is advantageous on several levels. For starters, you can rotate GMs much easier, which helps prevent burn-out and is very healthy for a group. It's also great for adding or removing players from the group; join or leave whenever! Finally, it makes it much easier to switch game systems, take a night off for board games or movies, and even put the whole group on hiatus from time to time (like over the holidays).

Following these guidelines has *vastly* improved my ability to continue gaming, even now that I'm getting older. I hope they help you, too! If you've got any other ideas, I'd love to hear about them in the comments. Cheers!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a637b6e0>,rpg,1484856737.0

But rats don't fight people. They are active at night and they are smart. They will hide and run as long as that is an option. That's why we've used cats and traps and ratcatcher dogs - because humans fighting rats in a straight combat does not make much sense.

Chickens on the other hand are active during the day. In a medieval settings they should be everywhere. Chickens are ferocious fighters - in some places they have been used for cockfighting before even being used for food. Roosters have long and sharp spurs - long enough to gouge arteries of an adult human with an unlucky strike. In fact, chickens are the smallest animals that have rarely, but consistently killed adult humans through force (and not with venom, poison, infection or an allergy).

TL;DR: The stereotypical first task for a hero should have been a farmer asking them to get rid of their rooster that became too aggressive to handle.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a644e390>,rpg,1739536391.0

I had a fascinating experience recently where I DM'd 5e for a group of colleagues, none of us with experience in the system, but some general experience in TTRPGs. We played around 4 hours through a short 2-room dungeon, with a fairly classic setup (save the blacksmith's daughter from goblin sacrifice). I had a bunch of sample characters laid out, from which the players picked. The exploration and combat encounters were fun, fluid, and sufficiently challenging (they barely escaped death). 

But all of the prejudices and complaints I had heard of about DND were so clearly showcased it was almost fascinating. First we had a no call no show. Then I had to discuss rules (which spells need a spell attack roll), our rogue stole loot gold and almost brought about PvP when the other players challenged him on it. I have no idea how I will resolve this next session btw. And to cap it off, the time we spent packing up was filled with debate on alignment despite me repeatedly saying to not worry to much about that and focus on looking at their characters motivations, instincts and flaws. 

I could hardly believe it that the memes I've heard about DND just stared me blank in the face like that. I'm utterly curious how the next sessions will go. I will probably put something less dungeon-crawly before them, and I'll see how it goes.

Edit: Y'all dropped about 10 times as many comments as I expected and I have a hard time keeping up on my phone. Let me address some common comments:

1. I don't think that my problems are DND- problems. I just wanted to express my surprise at running into exactly the things that people on the internet complained about with their DND games. 

2. We actually had a pretty good time and in terms of first games I've had far worse. I think 5e is a fun game and I enjoy its combat far more than some of the other games I've played. 

3. Of course no call no show is not a DND problem. It's just one of the almost memetic issues I've read about in connection with DND. This is obviously not a system problem...

4. Still excited to play next year. 

5. Thank you for all your advice and comments, I'll try to get to you later in the day. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a67a9400>,rpg,1544471609.0
24sd7z,My daughter's favorite game mechanic in our home-brewed RPG,"My 9 year old daughter and I have been playing a custom game since she was 3 called Princesses & Palaces. She loves most everything about the game but the simple mechanic I'm proudest of is one of the last ones we devised. 

Her princesses are d20 characters. That means they have 20 hp and every one of her rolls are d20. But many of the princesses' pets and most of the mobs are d4 on up. A goblin is d6. It has 6 hp and its puny rolls lead to a lot of quick deaths. All of the dice get used, which is ultimately the coolest part for a young kid, and she gets exposed to different percentages and variations of math and statistics as she fights d10 and d12 monsters. 

I remember playing D&D as a 12 year old back in 1981. We LOVED it like nothing else but even at 12 we didn't have patience for all the rules. What was important was rolling the fancy dice and killing the monsters. I feel like we've captured that simple kid excitement with this game and really gotten her hooked on the variety of dice with this mechanic. She's almost always the overwhelming favorite to win the rolls and her precious princesses are rarely in danger. But every once in a while her d20 under rolls my d4 or d8. 

Pretty sure I've got a gamer for life here. If anyone is interested in the Princesses & Palaces rule book for their own kids, let me know.

1gkdm0v,I think too many RPG reviews are quite useless,"I recently watched a 30 minute review video about a game product I was interested in. At the end of the review, the guy mentioned that he hadn't actually played the game at all. That pissed me off, I felt like I had wasted my time. 

When I look for reviews, I'm interested in knowing how the game or scenario or campaign actually plays. There are many gaming products that are fun to read but play bad, then there are products that are the opposite. For example, I think Blades in the Dark reads bad but plays very good - it is one of my favorite games. If I had made a review based on the book alone without actually playing Blades, it had been a very bad and quite misleading piece.

8tcdo0,"I started beginning and ending my sessions with a question, and my games have improved significantly.","The first question I’ve been asking across my (nine) games is “Where do you feel the campaign should end” if we hadn’t already defined that at session Zero. You’d be amazed at how short term some campaigns can be. I love years-long campaigns as much as the next guy, but sometimes it’s better to see the story wrap up nicely (or less than nicely). 

For instance, in our samurai campaign, the collective answer was “in a glorious last stand protecting the kingdom!” and now we’re working towards a war storyline. In our Naruto game, the answer is the Chuunin exams. 

Sessions after that, I’ve been trying to ask if there’s something special we would like to accomplish that day. Sometimes it’s something I wasn’t expecting, like finding answers but not necessarily completing x quest.

At the end of a session, I like to ask two questions: what was your favorite part of today’s session? What was your least favorite moment today? And sometimes I ask “what are you looking forward to in the campaign?”

All taken together, this has drastically improved the enjoyability of my games. Do you do something similar? Are there other questions you like to ask?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a6aa1a30>,rpg,1529782754.0
66cacu,Sometimes a duck is just a duck,"Let me preface this by stating that I don't think I'm an evil GM -- sometimes things just get away from you.  

I had no encounters planned, just a simple meeting.  I thought I'd have a little fun because the guys were acting so jumpy at the prospect of finally meeting a member of the resistance.  They were hoping to be recruited and join the fight against the Emperor.

---------------------------

**Players:** ""We're just going to sit and have a few drinks until our contact shows up.""

**GM:**  ""Okay.  It's a rowdy night tonight.  A few outlanders in skins gambling with dice near the fire pit.  A guy with an eyepatch and polished black leather armor yelling at one of the serving girls.  Some drunks playing a game where they punch each other at the bar.""

**Elwyth:**  ""Does the tavern girl look like she's in trouble?""

**Derek:**  ""No, seriously guys, we're not doing anything.  Nobody's doing anything.  We need her (our contact) to show up and not get scared away.  I order us all another round.""

**Elwyth:**  ""Fine.  I start chugging.""

**GM:**  ""Okay, well...""

**Derek:**  ""And if anyone looks like they want to start trouble with us I'm going to buy them drinks too.""

**GM:**  ""Okay, great.  Well, a couple hours go by and your contact still hasn't shown.  Everyone make a Perception roll.""

[*everyone fails except Zzan'q*]

**GM:**  ""Zzan'q, in the back of the tavern there's a door that's been dark all night, but now it's lit up.  There's a table in the room and standing on the table is a duck.  It appears to be staring at you.""

**Zzan'q:**  ""A duck, like the bird?  Where did it come from?""

**GM:**  ""Yes, it's a bird.  You're not sure, but you think it may have been there for quite a while.  You saw a serving boy enter the room a short time ago and he must've lit a lantern.  The room was dark before.""

**Zzan'q:** ""Wait, so there's been a duck staring at us from a dark room this whole time?""

**Derek:**  ""WTF?  Do I see this?""

**GM:**  ""Do you tell the others about the duck?""

**Zzan'q:**  ""I'm going to see if I can watch it without it noticing me first.  What's it doing?""

**GM:**  ""Roll Performance to see if you can play it off like you're not watching.""  [*success*]  ""Okay, it's not moving at all, just staring directly at you.""

**Zzan'q:**  ""Do I know if it's a wizard's familiar?""

**Derek:**  ""Is it polymorphed?  Could he tell if he cast Detect Magic?""

**Elwyth:**  ""I look around to see if our contact is here.""

**GM:**  ""No, you don't see her yet.  You're not sure if it's a familiar.  It's just standing perfectly still staring at you.""

**Zzan'q:**  ""I let these guys know what I see.  Is there anyone else in the room that is paying attention to us or the duck?""

**GM:**  ""Roll Perception.""  [*fails*]  ""No, you don't notice anyone.""

**Derek:**  ""Damn it, I pull a throwing dagger out under the table.  Elwyth, give me Cat's Grace.""

[*everyone consults their character sheets for spells and weapons*]

**Zzan'q:**  ""I'm going to slide my fireball wand into my hand under the table.""

**Elwyth:**  ""I'm going to cast Eagle's Splendor on myself.""

**GM:**  [*rolls dice*]  ""Okay, some people at the next table over start looking at you guys nervously.""

**Derek:** ""Damn.  What's the duck doing now?  Is it moving, does it notice us getting ready?""

**GM:**  ""It's standing perfectly rigid, just staring.""

**Elwyth:**  ""What the hell, guys, is this someone we know?  Who even knows we're here?""

**Derek:** ""Maybe that guy at the magic shop?""

[*At this point I figured the joke had gone on long enough.  I was just about to tell them it was just an animal stuffed by a taxidermist, sitting in the back room, when...*]

**Zzan'q:**  ""Screw this, I stand up and launch a fireball straight at the duck.""

[*pandemonium ensues, the tavern is burned to the ground, several patrons are wounded in the fight trying to subdue the PC's, and the contact they were waiting for stays far away from the commotion*]

------------------------

In retrospect, the PC's are probably better off not joining the resistance -- they're pretty good at supplying their own drama.

The funny thing is that these are older guys from my regular gaming group who I've known for a couple of years.  They're usually pretty rational and level-headed (right guys?)  Normally I don't stoop to this kind of silliness, which is maybe why it worked so well.

*[Under Hill, By Water](https://riseupcomus.itch.io/under-hill-by-water)* is an OSR(ish) game that’s about living in the cozy under-hill homes of the halflings.

**What do you do in Under Hill, By Water?**

* This game is about capturing your aunt’s escaped ornery goat. 
* This game is about growing the biggest turnip for the Harvest Festival.
* This game is about gathering rare ingredients for a birthday feast. 
* This game is about being simple and silly. 

**Wait, this sounds familiar**

You might remember that about three years ago I made a series of posts of a LotFP hack about playing a halfling in a peaceful, pastoral, quiet land called the Commonwealth. During quarantine this year, I blew the dust off of this project and created tons of new content for it. 

It's no longer a hack but a standalone game. Its parts and procedures should be familiar to fans of old-school TTRPGs. It's explicitly a game about the quiet pastoral life of halflings so a lot of fat from dragons and/or dungeons has been trimmed off. There are tons of flavorful randomizers to make sure your halfling's life is quiet, but never boring. Additionally, [Evlyn Moreau](https://www.patreon.com/evlynmoreau) and [Isaac Podyma](http://instagram.com/orangepipart/) very generously donated the use of their art to the project.

hmwfcs,Help! I'm a good DM but a problem player.,"TL DR: I learned the game as a DM, and now that I have the chance to be a player I'm being mad at the DM for running the game differently than I would. How do I stop being an asshole, chill out, and have a good time? 

I've been DMing D&D for ~10 years and i learned the game through that side of the DM screen.  I see encounters as carefully balanced equations, I see battlemaps as constructed choice generators, I different abilities as cool fun factors (or fun ruiners).  I see the game as a complicated tool to make the players have as much fun as possible and I think I'm good at it.  

BUT

Now I'm trying to be a player and everything pisses me off.  High AC, High health, low damage enemies drag on combat in a boring slug fest, PC get mind controlled with out even repeated saves, and battlefields are just empty wastelands. And I get SO MAD.  I've gotten better at not ruining things for the rest of the party now that I know I'm a problem, but that still kills the enjoyment for me.  The rest of the party seems fine with everything and that's all that really matters so it's not like the DM is make ""mistakes"", it's just that they run it differently from me.  I'm the problem, not the DM. 

Has this happened for other DMs who try to be players?  What mindset do players have that allow them to be immersed in the game and forget that someone is creating the world ahead of them?

My father just passed away after a 9 month long battle with glioblastoma. It's been pretty devastating to say the least, and I've skipped the past couple weeks running the LGS's Westmarches Campaign. So I mean it hasn't taken much, I'm a wreck. I think the pizza the other night made me sad. Ugh that's a different story. Anyways...


My aunt was sending emails around to all the relaticks asking who knew the names 'Netty, Ma'hal, Medrash, and Varis.' and I was answered her that I knew those names together.  I had forgotten that my regular players had sent a very nice bouquet to the wake and it made me break down...again... It was very nice and sweet of them to think of me. Now I must kill them for making me feel 'emotions'.



Interesting story-time;  that aunt was the one who together with her husband had gifted me ""Dragons of Autumn Twilight"" and ""The Hobbit"" When I was 12 or so at Christmas.  I absolutely devoured them and bought the entire Dragonlance series then continued on throughout the planes.  They're probably the reason I am a huge dork and still (forever)DM.  So I described each character and their titles/ affiliations in game with a bit of back story on them.  The aunt and uncle thought it was great and apparently my uncle used to play back in the 70's DM'd by his brother.  I was at their house picking up a thank you card and he (A professor with multiple degrees and phd's) said 'I'll be right back I have some of my Bro's books upstairs' and he jumped up bolted off and got the books attached in the picture below. Some of them have statistical equations scribbled in the margins haha.
[books!](https://i.imgur.com/o8eD5PB.jpg)


We talked some D&D and how it's culturally relevant again and exploding due to streaming and main stream media, he had thought it had just died off and gone away. suddenly he had a flash of remembrance about ""some dungeon I loved, that was green and had a lich in it!"" and ran off.   I was thinking... 'do you really have one of those? An original...?'


Sure enough he bounded back down their spiral marble staircase (they basically live in a mansion) carrying the below module:


[Green Dungeon with a lich.](https://i.imgur.com/3jIhDGR.jpg)


It appears my players, through making me feel those sad and happy emotions at the same time have delivered unto me their own demise. It's really all their fault.

jfm4i1,A Quick Tip for Game Masters,"By giving your villains seemingly innocuous traits you can set up future showdowns with foreshadowing. Here is an example of encountering the villain for the first time:

""You wade through the trash-filled alley to get a better look at who killed your friend. A tall man dressed in a fancy suit and baring a jagged scar on his chin is leaning up against the far wall smoking. The area is thick with cigarette smoke and many butts lay on the ground, you get the feeling he's been here before and this was not his first time.""

So the bad guy smokes. That doesn't seem relevant, merely just a basic trait. But next time you have the villain appear, emphasize his smoking habit again, keeping it subtle. Finally, when the real showdown is about to take place, have the party arrive on the scene, lets say they're there for another reason, and give them a strong clue that will trigger their memories.

""You arrive at the flower shop and to your surprise, the place is empty and dead silent. A thick stench of cigarettes wafts in the air. The backroom door is closed.""

Your players will hopefully pick up on your clues and your long-term planning will pay off in a subtle way, as your players will think they're brilliant for figuring out that the villain was in the area and it will set the tone of the scene in an intense way.

by6w2s,"I challenged myself to create One Million square-foot of original battle maps in 2 weeks (again). Here’s the results, The One Million Island, all free for you to download and use.","  

It appears my last challenge was a success. 1000’s of people downloaded it, and I hope they are all enjoying the original One Million. So, here’s my latest challenge; An island, One million square-foot play area of battlemap. I managed to do this one quite quickly (8 days), so much so that I have been able to create night versions to go with all of the maps.

A total of 16 x 50 x 50-inch, all original content, interconnected maps to create a tropical island.

[THE LINK](https://www.deviantart.com/zatnikotel/gallery/69418922/Island-One-Million)

So, with some trepidation, I present to you ‘The One Million Island’ 

Please remember, all of my maps, including these (and the gridded versions, and the night versions) are completely free (I don’t do Patreon, marketplace, etc.), it’s way to give back to a hobby that I have enjoyed so much for over 36 years. All I ask is that you don’t sell them, and you credit me wherever possible (if possible). If you do want to, and only if you can afford it, I have a Ko-Fi link on my Deviant Art page.

General breakdown of each area: 

A1: Volcano, A2: Dead Wood, A3: Submerged Ruins, A4: Shipwreck Beach

B1: Ponds B2: Ziggurat, B3: Mountain Lake, B4: Ancient Ruins

C1: Jungle Island, C2: River Bend, C3: River Crossing, C4: Jungle Wall

D1: Skull Cliffs, D2: Beach Landing, D3: Waterfall, D4: Native Village

I presently have plans for expansions to certain areas, but it does depend on the overall response to this set. Plans include the following: A cave system for D1, an underwater map for A3, below the ruins in B4, inside the buildings in D4, and of course, the ziggurat maps in B2. If you have any more suggestions, I’d be pleased to hear them. 

These maps are designed for use in VTT. This one is 50 x 50 inch, where 1 inch = 5-foot of game play.

I hope you enjoy!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a73b27e0>,rpg,1559991925.0

r10nie,What was the worst GMing advice that people actually used?,"Back in the day in Poland there was a series of articles called ""Jesienna Gawęda"" dedicated to GMing Warhammer Fantasy.

It's contents were at least controversial. One of the things the author proposed was to kill PCs. No rolls. No chatting. Just ""You die"".
It was ment to give the player the feeling of entering the ""grim world of warhammer"". It's not good advice. I'm all about 'punishing' an unprepared PC, but the player needs to have the means to prevent the problems.

People actually used this advice. It partially resulted in a strange RPG culture in Poland where the GM and players were competing against each other.

oh597q,"Using Military Planning Doctrine to develop ""Big Bad Evil Guys""","[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXCiOrGnJi0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXCiOrGnJi0)

Bad guys have bad plans. Your evil character is likely smart, conniving, and wants to beat your players and achieve their own goals (hopefully). This post and video was inspired by another popular writeup on the topic.

I've created a video that helps DMs better flesh out their BBEGs (Big Bad Evil Guys) by using the Army's OPORD (operational order) structure to help develop how your evil character goes about their evil plans!

**Step 1: Define the situation:**

1. Create Map where action takes Place
2. Describe situation in one sentence  
ex: The Ogre King Norag has created an alliance of foul creatures and began his march to conquer the lands of the Free People !
3. Pose dramatic question of the conflict  
Will the heroes be able to forge an alliance between the Free People and defend against King Norag’s army?

**Step 2: Define the Mission (Goals vary -- define long term mission vs short term mission)**  
Example Shor term mission -- Capture a coastal town of Poyraz.  
Who?  
Goblin Special Forces  
What?  
Amphibious assault on Poyraz  
When?  
Period of Darkness, May 10th  
Where?  
Northern shore  
Why?  
Circumvent blocking force, cut off human supply lines & gain control of bridge

**Step 3: Execution**  
How will your BBEG achieve victory? What are the decisive steps along the way needed for mission success?  
There are many non-violent ways to achieve mission success. Perhaps a wants to take over a major swath of land. They might bribe local officials to lower their defenses, or use spies to assassinate key figures!

**Step 4: Logistics**

**Beans**  
Living creatures need food, vampires need blood, dragons ""need"" treasure  
What does your BBEG need?

1. Fuel will affect their decisions
2. Roads & transportation matter

**Bullets**  
Archers need arrows, Mages need spell supplies (bat Guano, anyone? Big upvote if you remember which popular spell requires bat poop)

Bandit recruits need swords!

1. Production will be attacked

What about POWs?

**Step 5 Command and Control (I spent a lot of time making the Organization chart for this part of the ppt and I highly recommend using them to figure out how your bad guy communicates to their underlings!)**

**Leadership**  
Who’s actually in charge?

Centralized or Decentralized?

Who are the successors?

**Signals**

How does the BBEG get out his message & orders?

Who actually receives the message?

Is there intentional misinformation?

I hope these questions and examples help you all develop better evil characters in your campaign. I hope you enjoyed the video and found useful ideas in it!

The video has even more information and tips. Please consider liking/commenting on the video as that really helps my channel grow!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a762fd70>,rpg,1625866489.0
i9ichd,When the campaign is lost.,"I was running a game about saving the world from a cabal of sorcerers in the ancient north.  The players raised an army, faced opposition from within and without. The party uncovered ancient mysteries and reforged forgotten alliances.  The characters went from outlaws and laughing-stocks to become generals and grandmasters of the sorcerous schools.

Then last night we had our final session.  The player's armies were crushed, the sorcerers fell and the back up plans were thwarted. Two of the player character's died, both sacrifices to prevent the apocalypse but the battle was lost and without further intervention the handful of liches and elves were able to fulfill their plans anyway: they revoked the magic of the gods to made a world without births, a world where evil doers cannot be condemned to suffer in hell and the righteous are denied paradise in heaven.

One player character survived to witness the slow death of the world with no hope of ever being able to raise such an army again.

It was crushing, the defeat, we played hard and created an epic tragedy. I suppose I'm so used to the players turning things around and coming from behind to win at the last second that it genuinely shocked me when it didn't happen. We played to find out and we found out, but bloody hell!

kb80lc,Baking with my girlfriend reminded me how cheap this hobby is.,"I just spent quite a bit of money on baking supplies for tomorrow and realized that to get into this hobby it's actually very cheap.

Just by grabbing something like stars without number and worlds without number you can basically play most types of games that would come to mind. *when worlds comes out* 

It's not my favourite system, but I often use them as an example of ""complete"" games.

I think it just goes to show why the market is so small and why it doesn't even make a blip on Hasbro's radar.

I just spent 15 dollars on butter alone.  Stars without number is only 60 dollars for something with seemingly endless play time.  (That's if you want a hard copy)

If you're deep into the TTRPG community this video might just be a bunch of ""oh, that asshole"" that you recognise, but if you're in the shallow end this will probably be an educational video of particular bad actors in this space.

c6oymz,I really hate D&D some times.,"To clarify, I don't hate D&D as a system. I mean I have some issues with how limited it can be in regards to character creation and how some of the rules work, but overall it's a very solid system that is a great introduction to the world of role-playing. I respect the hell out of D&D.

&#x200B;

What I do hate about it, is that so few people (that I've personally met, hopefully, this isn't a majority issue) are willing to try systems other than D&D. I love the fact that since 5e came out there seems to have been a renaissance of RPG's, with more and more people willing to take up the hobby. But, it feels like everyone gets in a sort of comfort zone and will shy away from the prospect of anything that's not d20 rules. Again, I'm generalizing, but this is due to my own personal experiences. I met one pair of players who said that they had recently played a 'Star Wars' game and getting excited, I asked them what system they used, to which they responded with they modded 5e and I was just flabbergasted. I mean D&D isn't designed to be a universal system. Hell, if it was I could then at least understand why people don't want to change.

&#x200B;

I've tried multiple times with different groups, to run other systems like: Hero System, GURPS, Call of Cthulu, Cortex, Unisystem, Polaris, Numenera, Fantasy Flight Star Wars, and this list just goes on. But the majority of time, the group barely gets through character creation (if we even get that far) before they start giving up. I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm not selling the other systems that well, but no one else seems to even be willing to look at the books to see if they can understand it. There are sooooo many systems and settings that I've been wanting to try.

&#x200B;

I simply don't understand the apprehension to try something new. People have their comfort zones sure, but there's just so much beyond the boundaries of D&D, yet so few seem willing to explore it.

&#x200B;

Does anyone else have this issue or am on an island by myself? If you can relate, how do you convince players to take a chance on a new system? Where you ever that apprehensive player? What changed your mind?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Great Cesar's ghost! This post blew up. I never expected this kind of response. Thank you all for your comments and insights (yes even you three or so people who joked about the Game of Thrones showrunners, I see you).  

&#x200B;

Now, a few things to address. 

1. It seems like there's a chunk of you that think that I get upset with other players because they like D&D. That's not true at all. I have no problem with people liking the system, I just would like to be able to find people who are willing to try, keyword ""TRY"", something new. D&D will always be there and if you enjoy the system, that's great! It's a fine system to enjoy.

&#x200B;

2. Every time I've tried to introduce a new system, I always willing take on the role of GM. It would be ludicrous to expect someone to pick up a new system, just so that I can be a player. I always want to slowly integrate people into the system and will be taking on the brunt of anything that may be difficult (i.e. the math). I tell my players this up front and that always seems to ease their concern somewhat. The Pre-gen idea feels like the best way to go.   


3. It's difficult for me to wrap my head around some of the reasons given (too time-consuming, too much work, don't want to read, etc.) seeing as how I find that kind of stuff fun. I'm a writer & filmmaker, so creating new worlds and characters have always appealed to me. And the reasoning that some gave about GM's not wanting to put in the work and would rather have something with a lot of extra material (modules and such) available is particularly baffling to me. To each their own though, I get that not everyone is going to have the same mindset I do. All of the replies have given me a better perspective on the whole thing and so hopefully I can work on fixing my sales pitch, if you will.

&#x200B;

4. This thread has also made me realize that I need to do something that I've thought was needed for a while. I feel like there should be a video series of different RPG settings and systems, that go over the character creation processes and rules of each and culminates in an actual play set up to show how everything works. I feel like if I had a group and I was trying to convince them to play a new system, that showing them a video explaining things would be better received than just handing them a PDF.

wnbf3z,Opinion: Buying & selling gear is one of the weakest and blandest parts of traditional RPGs.,"Not trying to put down anyone who doesn't mind how buying & selling stuff works, I just wanna express my annoyances even though everyone's table experience and opinions are different.

I dunno if it just has to do with how my DMs and I have gone about doing it, but I find the process of buying gear and selling treasure to be a very unexciting part of traditional fantasy tabletop systems like D&D, Pathfinder, and others. For a part of the game that happens so frequently, I've found that every ""shopping encounter"" goes like this:

1. PCs arrive in a town with things to buy or sell.

2. Sometimes, the shop to sell a specific item isn't there, and it has to be done at another town, otherwise,

3. PCs go into a shop. Sometimes, there's a bit of roleplay as the DM describes the store and the quirky shopkeep, but usually this is just skipped as everyone wants to get it over with. Sometimes there will be a Charisma check to haggle for a specific item, but usually not.

4. Money is added or subtracted and said item is exchanged.

I get that this might be a necessary evil, but I'm only complaining about this because it *feels* like it could be done better, and it's such a significant part of the game that it needs some refinement. Coinage has to have some sort of meaning so the players can get excited about having it to purchase the goodies they want, but this whole process feels as dry as doing taxes to me.

Am I missing something? Are there better ways to do this, to spice up the way shopping or selling treasure works to make it more exciting? Have you tried any personal ways to spice things up, or know of any systems that use an alternative method of doing things, like a barter system? I want to make the exchange of goods more interesting.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a873fce0>,rpg,1660386880.0
ugxo9g,"Silly Idea: Multiverse Superhero team game, where everyone plays as a variation of the same character.","I've been reading too many alternate universe comics in which slightly-tweaked versions of characters bump into other versions of themselves, and I'm absolutely *here* for it. I've been wondering if it might be fun to try a similar setup in an RPG, just to see how the dynamic plays out at the table. What do you think of this idea?

The players are provided with a basic template for, say, Captain Fantastic. Fantastic has a race, class, stats, and basic background, e.g., ""Father was a supervillain, killed him in single combat and liberated the city he controlled."" Players take that template and must build a fresh character around it, the whacker the better, without consulting the other characters. Thus, the party consists of Good Sir Fantastic, a knight who deposed evil King Fantastic I, Captain Fantastic 2099, who protects a space station, bitter and jaded Old Man Fantastic, and so on. Importantly, each character is convinced they are the One True Fantastic, and do not know anything about the others.

The characters are drawn together into the ""prime"" universe when Prime  Fantastic goes missing, and are tasked with saving the city from a powerful villain that, in all likelihood, will turn out to be a gender-swapped Captain Fantastic.

Do you think this might work? Or would I be better off, I dunno, just writing some superman fantiction? :P",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a876c9e0>,rpg,1651520023.0

Initially McElroy denied all the allegations in a facebook post, but that post has since been deleted and replaced with a statement saying he is to "" seek some professional guidance"" and will be away from work for awhile. McElroy's accuser initially claimed not to have kept his years of correspondence with her that detailed the abuse, but after he posted his initial denial she has seemingly rediscovered the texts/emails on an old phone which may have led to the retraction of McElroy's first blanket denial of her claims.

McElroy is the latest in a string of Onyx Path employees to have been accused of harassment and grooming while working at the company (see Matt McFarland, John Morke). These allegations come days after his predecessor at DriveThruRPG, Shane DeFreest, was accused of rape.

rjb4zh,Don't be afraid to move on from that group you've been in forever.,"I was with a group for probably eight years, middle school until about a year ago. They're good people don't get me wrong but man were they shitty players. 

One person's etiquette was beyond terrible, would be on their phone most of the session, randomly shoot important NPC's, never ever bothered to learn the rules (I'd have to roll for them) etc. 

Another never told me if they were comming or not giving me no time whatsoever to prep. On top of that same problems as the other player. 

Another would say extremely stupid, racist, and/or homophobic shit for no reason. 

One was never able to make a backstory for their character.. . Ever. No personality, no RP, nothing. They were just a bystander the whole story, only participating in combat. 

The fifth person was mostly alright but was a chronic rules lawyer who just always had his two cents to give. I was the forever GM and he would sometimes offer to GM. His games always fell through and it'd be back on me, which was frustrating. 

Eventually I fell out with one of them and decided to bow out. I ended up looking for groups online. Thank God for online games. 

I've met a lot of people who are actually considerate and do basically none of the things I've mentioned here. If you feel like your legacy group of sorts is getting stale: it is, you're right, move on. 

These sorts of groups are often romanticized but I gotta say sometimes that Magic just doesn't stick. I still talk to all of these people save one, none of them play anymore. I'd be lying if I said I don't find that gratifying. 

Tldr: Your childhood friends might actually not be the best people to play TTRPGS with. Sometimes we don't realize that otherwise great people can be toxic players. Don't be afraid to find a group of hobbyists with similar values and expectations.

ovcpbj,Accidentally tried something new as a GM and it ended up working out super well.,"I invited my friends to play the Modiphius Dune RPG, but I had to go pick up some takeout to feed myself and my GF right as they all showed up, bad timing on my part. I gave them the character sheets and the book and left for 30 minutes. I wasn't really expecting anything to happen, I thought they would just shoot the shit for half an hour, which would have been fine. What ended up happening was they had a pitch for a game they wanted (which was nothing like what I had planned) and their characters concepts ready for me (also not what I was expecting). I was a little hesitant to try and work with a campaign seed not of my own creation, but after a couple minutes of asking questions and furiously improvising a solar system while they statted up characters, we were off to the races. This probably is going to seem obvious, but I have never seen players be more invested in a game. Y'all should try this session 0.5 method of ""say you're playing X setting then fucking off entirely out of the room for 30 minutes"" and tell me if this was a fluke or not. 

Props to the Mophidius Dune system, the editing/writing in the book is shit sometimes but the system itself is lightweight enough for you to straight up run a dune game with no prep, provided you have knowledge of the setting, while still having enough crunch to dial in on the really important stuff. Plus, the narrative currency system really smooths out the improvisation.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a9a15e80>,rpg,1627757458.0

You play as the crew, but the action is supposed to unfold like a heist movie. So instead of doing lots of planning beforehand, whenever you're faced with an obstacle, you can trigger a flashback to show how you planned ahead for it.

f2qjvw,"Soooo, I made a sci-fi rpg with a sex toy company","So, a few months ago an interactive sex toy company asked me to host a new sci-fi rpg show they were creating. I though the whole idea was pretty hilarious as this is the company that creates machines to stick your Fleshlight in (Kiiroo). 

Anyhow, I thought 'why not' and met up with them to talk about this new game and what they were thinking of for the show. Turns out they were huge geeks themselves and wanted to create a near-apocalyptic sci-fi game that (in some way) included sex-positivity and adult themes. And they wanted to play it with comedians from the UK. I had no clue how this was going to pan out but as a big D&D nerd I thought I'd just go for it. Because why the hell not. 

Now, a few months later, the first episode of Thanatos is here! Game-wise it's sort of D&D light. It turned out as a silly and ridiculous actual-play show that had me cracking up every single episode - even though the themes are quite serious. 

Episode 1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msYHlZ118yw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msYHlZ118yw). You can find video's about the characters on the same YouTube channel.

I don't care if they were forged by Gygax, stamped by Jackson, and painted by Siembada if 1) I can't read it from behind a screen 2) it does not have Arabic numerals or pips in the standard configuration 3) it is big enough that you pick it up with both hands 4) it flashes or makes noise outside of being rolled or 5) it rolls for more than 5 seconds and as often as not off the table or through the battle map like the boulder from Raiders (looking at you d100) then stop slowing down the game and keep it off the table.

9hix4m,My 13 yo daughter is starting a D&D group as part of a class assignment but they will only have :30 to play. What (and how) could she run such a session for a group of complete RPG newbies?,"  
She's a player in the Fallout Tabletop campaign (using custom rules) that I've been running since the beginning of the year, so she has at least some idea how RPG works. Everyone else however is completely new to it.

It's part of an assignment in a once-a-week class: Create a guild, invite other classmates. She did that and 5 people joined. First assignment is ""List what academic qualities your guild has."" Well shit that's the easy part. First, *MATH,* then a bunch of intangibles from logic to leadership.

The 2nd thing is she's already planning the character making session for next weeks class, so that's not going to suck away time from play.

The hard part is content. Experienced players could grab, or even throw together, canned chars and jump into an arena fight, king of the hill type, and play for 30 no problem. Being new is what makes it difficult.

I was thinking a couple of simplified things:

* Use 1 die. d20 only. 
* Baddies can only take certain number of hits, and each successful d20 roll takes off one hit. So a goblin would have 1 hit, but the boss vampire/dragon/demon would have say 6 hits... with a party of 5, it would take minimum 2 rounds to bring him down. This removes the tedium of damage dice, but also removes the math.
* Have a small set of chars that the players can choose from, and give them simplified stats. Then have a set of options for those chars to choose from. This would allow some customization while keeping things simple. For example, choose 3 from a list of 10 mage spells with different effects.

With a simple set of rules and options, the time-consuming parts of a DnD session are reduced to a minimum, allowing for speedier story telling, adventuring and murder hobo-ing.

One other thing: She said D&D, I'm not opposed to suggesting a 3rd party ruleset, but I think as a core concept it should stick to DnD-like high magic fantasy. 

What other ideas could I incorporate? What caveats should I keep in mind?  ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a9b7e090>,rpg,1537476990.0
amu6o6,"I commissioned an artist to paint the climax of a Call of Cthulhu campaign I ran, and the results are malevolent","**Contains major spoilers for** ***The Curse of Nineveh*** **campaign!**

I ran *The Curse of Nineveh* campaign in Call of Cthulhu which lasted for more than twenty sanity-rending blood-soaked sessions. To commemorate it I commissioned artist [@ChrisCantArt](https://twitter.com/ChrisCantArt) to paint us a picture of the climax. And boy did he deliver!

The climax started when the British monarch George V was possessed by the baddie, and one of my PCs murdered him right at the center of the annual royal garden party. This was just as London was about to be attacked by an avatar of Yog-Sothoth. It decimated the artistocracy at the soiree, and the characters barely survived - although one quite lost his mind.

Here the PCs have commandeered one of the many anti-air batteries scattered around London. It took quite a few barrages for it to finally fall. Fantasy Grounds VTT supported throwing ""only"" 30 dice at one time, so we ended up having to roll for damage in batches. They ended up dealing 12,461 HP of damage before the avatar went back to whence it came.

A few days later the same PC executed Edward VIII as part of the epilogue - another possession, or so he claims to this day. Later the whole thing was explained away by a German superweapon attacking London and their agents murdering the kings, so Weimar Republic took the blame. This paved the way for the eventual (expedited) rise of Hitler, more appeasement of Nazi Germany, and the start to an Achtung! Cthulhu campaign we're thirty sessions in, some players still using the same characters from the campaign in the 20s - if battle-weary and low on Sanity.

The PC who killed the two kings even met the next king George VI as the king personally launched a special section of the intelligence services at the onset of WWII to investigate the budding Nazi research into the Cthulhu Mythos. The king understandably has quite a keen interest in Cthulhu Mythos himself as a result of his dad and brother being murdered under rather curious circumstances. This time the king survived the encounter.

We couldn't be more thrilled how the image turned out! It captures the chaos of the scene, and even shows the PCs as I described them to Chris.

tv5qdm,Do not be afraid to switch your TTRPG System and try something new,"When I was twelve, we started playing TTRPGs. During the 90s in Germany, people played mostly ""das schwarze Auge"" (internationally known as ""the dark eye""), which is a d20 based Fantasy rpg, that was developed as something as an answer to DnD. I played this during my teen years in school and stuck to it during university after finding a new group of guys, who also all had started TTRPGs with the dark eye. We played in various group constallation till the end of university. People were always dropping in and out of the groups and we had the usual problems of people not showing up and a general fatigue in long running campaigns. 

Actually, most of the guys wanted to play but our first love with TTRPGs just did not work out anymore. Still, like sometimes in real live relationships, it took us years to understand and express what was actually bothering us with the dark eye (to complicated und clunky magic and combat, way to much bookkeeping in general). Finally, we decided to try something new. We switched to Shadowrun, which didn't sit well with us at all. Back to the dark eye for another year but still unsatisfied. 

Then, one day, a friend introduced us to Malifaux - Through the breach. No dice, just card flipping. Fewer rules and more focus on personal character Development.  After a short campaign with Malifaux, I mostly took over GMing. I ran a Calll of Cthulhu campaign (masks of Nyarlathotep), then two homebrewed Cyberpunk Red campaigns, a Cthulhu Pulp campaign (The two headed serpent) and right now we are in the middle of a Conam 2d20 campaign. 

Between each campaign, which all took 3 to 5 months, or on days when not everybody could attend, we did unrelated one shots in other, mostly rules light systems (Alien by free League, Paranoia, Brindlewood  bay).

In contrast to our neverending dark eye campaign,  the Limited lengths of our campaigns, coupled with regular switching of the system, resulted in a generally higher attendance, more motivation on both the player and the GM side and an open mind towards what is possible in TTRPGs in general. 

While this probably won't work for all groups, it changed to world of gaming for us. I do not want to tell you to switch your system just for changeing systems sake, but I cannot recommend enough, to not be afraid to leave behind an long used system and try something completely different.Just because you played [XXX] all your life, it does not or must not limit your gaming world to this one game.

Talk to your players, talk with your players and discover, what you would like to try out but never did. I twice did presentations on various other systems and finished with a poll, what my group would love to try next. You need not commit yourself forever to a new system, either. Just do a oneshot and see if you like it or not. 

This might be rambling to some of you who do this anyway, but my younger self should have read my wall of text with 22 to branch out much earlier in my gaming life.

Thank you all for reading this and have fun playing whatever you are playing now or in the future!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a9bf43e0>,rpg,1648979357.0
gydm5p,"Anyone Else Had That ""Ah Ha!"" Moment When It Came To Playing a Support Character?","Like a lot of gamers starting out, I had a hard time giving up the spotlight. I wanted to be the one striking the death blow, wiping out the horde of enemies, etc. But when I started actually crunching the numbers, and seeing what could happen if your party had a dedicated buffer on their side, I realized the real power was in being the general, not the foot soldier.

It was two or three campaigns back, and I'd put together a cleric/transmuter/mystic theurge for the express purpose of healing and buffing the party. The difference between, ""party without boosts,"" and, ""party with boosts,"" was like watching the NOS unit go off in an action movie. My PC did maybe 80 points of total damage throughout the entire campaign, but the sheer amount of times he snapped his fingers and completely unraveled the enemy's strategy, allowing his allies to go in for the kill amazed me.

Sadly, once you discover how to be a good support character, everyone expects you to fill that role. So even when I make PCs that aren't designed for it, I find myself falling back into that spot because no one else is stepping up, and we need those numbers to push forward.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a9c20d40>,rpg,1591540935.0
abuhf1,The Best Premade Campaigns,"Hello there! I’m a voracious reader of whatever I can get my hands on, and for the last couple years I have been on an absolute kick of reading rpg campaigns. After consuming so many, I wanted to share what I view as the absolute top rung of the ladder.

&#x200B;

*13th Age- Eyes of the Stone Thief*: The conceit here is absolutely brilliant; What if the dungeons the PCs explore wasn’t just malevolent, but the main antagonist. What emerges is a megadungeon that actually feels alive and active that the players will alternately react to and against. It builds upon all of the strengths of the semi-improvisational nature of the system, and really lets the players loose.

&#x200B;

*Savage Worlds- 50 Fathoms/ Sundered Skies*: This is how you do a sandbox (more like wet/sky box, am I right?) Jam Packed with content, be a pirate.

&#x200B;

*Call of Cthulhu-Beyond the Mountains of Madness*: If CoC can be counted upon for doing one thing, it is turning out amazing adventure after amazing adventure. While the weakest of the mega-campaigns of the system with a agonizingly slow pace in the first half, the second is so exceedingly strong that it is well worth the ride.

&#x200B;

*Call of Cthulhu- Horror On The Orient Express:* Plenty of campaigns struggle with making sure that the players will willingly go along with the adventure. Some will make a sandbox, expecting the GM to make up the rest. Others will simply disguise their nature and move along with modular design. This adventure says “Fuck that” and puts the game on a literal railroad. It is glorious.

&#x200B;

*Call of Cthulhu- Masks of Nyarlathotep*: What can be said about this that hasn’t already been written? Each edition’s rendition of the masterwork improves upon it even more, without ever making it feel bloated or dated. Not only is it a contender for the greatest premade adventure of all time, it is one of the greatest pulp adventure works ever written. A masterpiece in every sense of the word.

&#x200B;

*Call of Cthulhu- The Things We Leave Behind*: Look, this one is a bit of a cheat. There isn’t a clear way to string these together, and they weren’t really meant to be. However, as a released compendium this contains some of the finest modules I have encountered. *Forget Me Not* alone is worth the price of admission.

&#x200B;

*Chuubo’s Marvelous Wish Granting Engine*\- *The Glass-Maker’s Dragon*: The system itself might be overly complicated and frustrating to play, but this supplement is staggering in its imagination in regards to the product’s ambition.

&#x200B;

*Deadlands Reloaded- The Flood/ Last Sons*: Weird West fiction at its finest, these are unique with their willingness to allow homebrew. I haven’t read the other campaigns in the line, but if they reach the quality of these two then I’ll be plenty impressed. Yee-haw.

&#x200B;

*Delta Green- A Night At The Opera*: Look, another flagrant violation of the undisclosed rules. This scenario book contains hands-down the best scenario writing I have ever read with each module presenting a distinctly themed joint of horror. The best horror system around always strive to be even better.

&#x200B;

*Degenesis Rebirth- Jehammed’s Will* (*In Thy Blood*, *The Killing Game*, *Black Atlantic*): The epic saga of possibly the finest post-apocalyptic system ever released. Gorgeously detailed and meticulous written this takes second place of my favorite premise campaign. Come for the production values, stay for the brutality.

&#x200B;

*Dungeons & Dragons- Night Below*: TSR’s swansong, this epic campaign demonstrates just how good the cornerstone of rpgs can be when in the right hands and why it has stayed around for so long. Also has the best representation of the Underdark, period.

&#x200B;

*Dungeons & Dragons- Curse of Strahd*: Ravenloft is often held up as the best D&D module, yet this 5E campaign takes its place as the pinnacle of what the venerated system’s lineage can do. 

*Heroquest- Sartyr Kingdom of Heroes*: This is what sword and sorcery campaigns should strive to be, what they can be if they are unashamed of their roots. If you love games that are willing to just be fun, then you owe it to yourself to read this.

&#x200B;

*King Arthur Pendragon- The Pendragon Campaign*: Some say that this is the best that prewritten material has ever been, and it is hard to disagree. With a vision so far above most other works, the magnum opus of Greg Strafford is a venerable classic.

&#x200B;

*Kult- The Black Madonna/ Judas Grail*: These right here are the peak of what horror rpgs can be. Dark, disturbing, sick, and sacrilegious they all cross several lines, yet never feel gratuitous  Read these if  you wish to experience a world where reality itself has gone wrong. With the advent of *Divinity Lost*, *The Black Madonna*  has become even better.

&#x200B;

*Lamentations of the Flame Princess- The Red and Pleasant Land/ Better Than Any Man/ Deep Carbon Observatory*: There is much to be said about LotFP. Criticisms about its edginess and lack of subtly have been risen. Yet there is no way to deny that each of these are so superbly written it is hard to to notice those complaints.

&#x200B;

*Legend of Five Rings- City Of Lies*: This is, hands down, the best location ever created in the history of rpgs. Every part of the city is detailed, and the campaign itself matches that quality. Required reading.

&#x200B;

*Mekton- Operation Rimfire*: Anime as hell, it still packs plenty of heart. If you enjoy all the excesses of classic sci-fi and 90’s anime, then at least give this a cursory glance.

&#x200B;

*Night’s Black Agents- The Zalozhniy Quartet*: Another day, another compilation book that can be strung into an excellent campaign. Features the best heist ever in rpgs, and a fantastic villain. Would be the best improv campaign if not for...

&#x200B;

*Night’s Black Agents- The Dracula Dossier*: Look, this thing, this magnificent thing, is a titan. A veritable behemoth of writing, there is just so much here to unpack. Every page bursts with ideas that could fuel an entire campaign, that could serve as something sessions of fun on their own. The only downside is just how much of a niche styled GM you have to be to run it. If you do the ability though there is nothing else quite like it.

&#x200B;

*The One Ring- The Darkening of Mirkwood*: A smaller, more intimate version of Greg Strafford’s classic, this campaign captures just what is so magical and visionary about the words of J.R.R. Tolkien. Combine with *Heart of the Wild* and *Tales From the Wilderland* for a beast of a work.

&#x200B;

*Orpheus- The Orpheus Campaign*: The forgotten child of WoD, this line of six books deserves more recognition as the fantastically realized world that it creates. A pseudo-sequel to the best WoD material, *Orpheus* is lovely in every way. The most underrated campaign in the entirety of rpgs.

&#x200B;

*OSR- Maze of the Blue Medusa/ Hot Springs Island/ Stonehell*: Another cheat to lump all of these together, but I could not find out any other way to speak of the importance of these three. The apex of the OSR philosophies, these crawlers are packed with puzzles and difficult encounters.

&#x200B;

*Paranoia- Yellow Clearance box Blues*: There is plenty of great modules written for this system, but this stands as the “obvious” best. Melding *Paranoia*’s classic writing with modern design sensibilities and the power of rock, this scenario is a beating blast.

&#x200B;

*Pathfinder- Kingmaker/ Age of Worms/ Curse of the Crimson Throne*: It is hard not to respect Paizo for their efforts in keeping the structured premise campaigns alive when they were near abandoned in the late 00’s. These are their best efforts, the adventures that deserve to stand alongside the classics.

&#x200B;

*Pathfinder- Way of the Wicked*: The second best fan campaign ever made for an rpg, this evil adventure has several issues, but the concept alone is worth checking out. It really captures what it means to be an overlord fighting against the forces of good.

&#x200B;

*Pathfinder/ D&D 4E/ D&D 5E- Zeitgeist*: One of my favorite videos games ever created in an rpg called *Arcanum*. A steampunk fantasy meld it is about the dawning of a new age, the struggle of hierarchies, and the nature of faith. *Zeitgeist* here is the only equivalent I have been able to find. An absolute unit of a campaign, it stands as the greatest fan made campaign ever.

&#x200B;

*Runequest- Griffin Mountain:* An essential ancient campaign that many modern adventures draw their inspiration from. Holds up remarkably well, and still has some surprises hidden inside. 

&#x200B;

*Star Wars (WEG)- Operation Elrood*: “Let’s board a star destroyer, and blow it up!” Demonstrates why this franchise has stuck around for forty-odd years.

&#x200B;

*Trail of Cthulhu- Eternal Lies*: The modern rival to Mister Gnarly’s *Masks*, this campaign is explosively impressive. A fine mystery, a pulp adventure, and plenty of twists. The best campaign of the last decade.

&#x200B;

*Trail of Cthulhu- Cthulhu City*: Much like the campaign books of *Degenesis*, this work is part source book and part adventure. A love letter to the Weird, with more hooks than Lake Champlain in the summer.

&#x200B;

*Traveller- Pirates of Drinax*: This here is the finest, largest, mindboggingly detailed sandbox I have ever encountered. Could supply a decade of content easily.

&#x200B;

*Unknown Armies 2E- TO GO*: My favorite setting, my favorite system, my favorite campaign. A fantastic (road/head/ road head) trip across the American gestalt.

&#x200B;

*WFRP- The Enemy Within*: The fans say this is the finest adventure ever written, and the detractors will grudgingly admit that it is certainly impressive. A wondrous achievement in adventure writing, the promise of it being modernized and bettered looms on the horizon.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a9c6f4a0>,rpg,1546443828.0
7g5xta,Running a campaign with elderly characters.,"I am currently running a Pathfinder campaign for the most creative kids I’ve ever met. A few months ago, my cousin, who is about 13, asked me if I could run an TTRPG for him and his friends. I gave them the regular sales pitch of games and in a unanimous decision they decided Pathfinder was the game for them. 

Little did I know, they would all play elderly characters… I’m talking a 300 hundred year old elf ranger, a 200 year old dwarf barbarian, a 75 year old human cleric, and a 125 year old gnome wizard. 

Being a very lenient gm when it comes to character creations I allowed this with the usual bonuses and penalties; -2 to strength and + 3 on wisdom, that sort of thing. But when I heard their back story I almost died. 
In their own words, it goes like this: 

Nearly 40 years ago now, Tadak the elven ranger led his band of mercenaries on a quest so epic… It would make and enemy for life. After spending nearly 10 years together looting dungeons, protecting villages, and rescuing babes, “Wolf’s Fang Mercenaries for Hire” accepted the job of destroying Madicore the necromancer. Of course, in their prime this was a simple job for the heroes, and luckily this set them up for life following the quests success. They retired to their respected countries of origin and there they lived telling stories of their adventures to the families they soon had. Each lived a happy and peaceful life, they watched their kids grow up and eventually come together into a new group of adventures.

All was well, until one fateful night It first started with Hamon the Cleric having a dream of his son being taken by their old foe, Madicore. The dream trickled down the line to Ganoosh the Gnome(for his daughter), Diado the Dwarf(for his son), and finally Tadak the elf(for his son). Soon they found these dreams to be true, Madicore had returned and he had taken our heroes children, to no one knows where. 
In agreement for one last adventure the heroes 4 decided to band together to save their kids and trully put an end to Madicore the necromancer.  End.

I was so lost in the beauty of this story that I couldn’t help but let it be. I wrote their first campaign around this story as well, in which the magic truly ensued. On several raids to necromancer ruins the players would pretend to be old and frail, in hopes of being taken captive. Once inside the dungeons at the bowels of enemy camps they would break out and wreak havoc upon their enemies. Eventually, word would spread throughout the world, making even the quickest of rogues fear picking the pockets of old people. 

In instances of critical failures, they would attribute them to their old age. For Tadak, failing a ranged attack would be his arthritis kicking in and for Ganoosh he would get sudden dry mouth making it hard to pronounce his spells. The best, in my opinion, was for Diado every time he failed a roll, his waning mind would cause him to forget where he was and what he was doing; which would only send him into a rage. I’m looking forward to see how the end fight goes. 

They're some of the best players roleplay wise I've ever gm'd for, but they're still getting to know the game system.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a9c8b3b0>,rpg,1511891380.0

2t1uuh,Willow is the most accurate cinematic representation of D&D to date,"From [Kalman Farago](https://plus.google.com/114571895564510228306/posts?partnerid=gplp0), and quite witty:

""...Willow, because I love that movie and I maintain it's the most accurate cinematic representation of D&D to date.  It's got:

- A Magic User PC who is so useless at magic as only 1st level D&D M.U.-s can be but knows how to fucking carry it.
- The guy who keeps doing stupid things and getting everyone in trouble for shits and giggles.
- The two guys who picked a completely useless race that can't fight or even keep up with the others, but who amazingly manage to rise to the challenge and be useful on the extremely rare occasion.
- The player who showed up halfway into the campaign so the DM just pulled a heel-face turn and gave her a formerly evil henchwoman.
- An angelic visitation explaining in no uncertain terms that THIS IS YOUR QUEST NOW STOP FAFFING ABOUT AND GO ON IT.

1cc5q9w,Why do players often prefer crunchy rules but rarely learn them?,"I'm wondering if this is a wider phenomenon than people I've played with.

My players typically claim they prefer crunchy rule sets such as DnD, d100 games such as Warhammer , etc. Yet they never actually  learn the rules and rely on the GM to guide all rules resolutions.

However when we have played games that I've wanted to GM such as Black Hack, Mechahack, and other low crunch games they learn all the rules, but claim they're too shallow.

Personally I enjoy both crunchy and simpler games. I just don't understand why my players prefer crunch, but never bother learning all the rules.

Basically the idea is after an extremely raucous celebration the Dwarves have drunk all the beer in the Hold.

I'll have the PCs either realize they drank all the beer and need to find a way to replace it all before the collective hangover kills them.

Or the PCs go full Patrick and go on a whodunnit trying to find the missing beer\theives with evidence constantly pointing to themselves but they just ignore that and keep finding new leads.

For the first one they can either try to figure out a way to brew it all, or using a Dwarven scholars new discovery (30 years ago), realize there's giant space clouds made of beer and beating up some nerds to get a spaceship\get parts to build one.

For help, I'd like any recommendations of paths they could take, any mechanics for being all dwarves (Feats and maybe achievements they can earn to get bonuses), I'm going to have the honor system from the DMG implemented since I feel it makes sense for dwarves.

I'm also wondering if I should throw some Dwarf fortress into the background so they can have some basebuilding\fortress running.

Lastly I want to have a PC for myself to play as it's only the 3 of us.

umo6uu,Hit'em where it hurts: alternatives to character death as a means of raising the stakes,"""*I've done far worse than kill you. I've hurt you. And I wish to go on hurting you. "" - Khan Noonien Singh*

When I started playing D&D in 1979, I was terrified that my character would die. We were all very new to the hobby and character death was the worst thing I could imagine. Then my character died and was resurrected. Death, for many players, became a mini-game like shopping. The impermanence removed the fear and without the fear there were no meaningful stakes.

Within two years RPGs were everywhere. Sci Fi, Superhero, Westerns, and so many D&D imitators. By 1982 almost every game had a way to resurrect characters or mitigate death in most cases. Death had no sting.

It was Superhero games that taught me how to raise the stakes without killing a character. The only way to threaten a Superhuman was to go after the things they loved. Put the things they value at risk and suddenly they are afraid. Tension is built when we hope for one outcome and fear another. Drama is built when we want something, and another person denies it to us.

Here are some real-life examples from play:

Example 1: *The superhero team is roleplaying a Christmas party for their characters. They are alerted to a major crisis. They are joined by a few superhero NPCs that were at their party. They all leave to deal with the crisis. At the end of the battle one of the NPCs has been killed and the other is in a coma. The PCs return to their base and see all of the Christmas decorations.*

This was a scene that left the characters broken. The Christmas party was like ashes in their mouths. Then spent five sessions hunting the villains and had to balance their sense of justice and their need for revenge.

Example 2: *The players are big damn heroes. They have been using a small village as their base of operations for a while. They know the names of 20 or so NPCs. They have the NPCs join their war council as advisors. One of the advisors was turned by their enemy. During the council meeting the betrayer suicide bombs the meeting. The PCs are barely harmed. The Councilor NPCs have less than 8 hit points each. The NPCs are instantly vaporized. Did I mention the PCs are big damn heroes? They are the highest level characters in the world (other than their enemy). The PCs can't Raise Dead or Resurrect. Those NPCs are gone. The players wept.*

This scene drove the players to redouble the efforts in their war on the enemy. Every battle was fought in the name of the fallen victims. They held funerals for the dead. They felt real emotions and they were realized that betrayal was an option.

Example 3: The players were going dungeon crawling into the tomb of a dead god. They were warned that anyone below a certain level of power (\*class level) *would die instantly. The players couldn't risk taking anyone with them. The cleric entered the tomb first. He was unharmed. From within his backpack there was a small \*squeak\* and the remains of the cleric's pet hedgehog sifted out and onto the floor. I picked up the hedgehog toy I had given the player and dropped it in the trash-can.*

This was a real moment for all the players. It changed the way they viewed the world. They realized how frail and impermanent NPCs (and pets) were. The PC went so far as to bargain with the God of Death for the life of the pet.

All of these examples have been called shocking and monstrous by people. That's because they work. My players know that they have to protect what matters to them. They are willing to sacrifice the life of their characters to do it. That's the point. They became heroes because they discovered that there was something worth dying for.

Attack their home base. Kill their favorite NPC. Have a loyal retainer betray them. Make combat challenging.  Make character death meaning and a player's choice. That's how you raise the stakes.

o9lkkm,An Ode to Enthusiastic Players,"You know the kind.

They don't need to know the setting or the system before play. They don't even need to make their own characters. They read the handout at the start of the session. They read their pregen and ask a few questions. They make excited noises at all the right parts and a few you hadn't thought would have an impact.

You set the stage, and you ask them what their character is doing. The character they didn't even make.

They tell you about the little mannerisms that make this fictional person real, tying everything back into the smattering of clues that came with the character sheet. The player melts away when spoken parts begin, their speech patterns and voice replaced with the character's.

They even say, out of character, ""Hey, \[other player / DM\]? I'm playing my character in this way because that's how I interpreted them, but feel free to stop something if it runs counter to what the group wants.""

Here's to you, Enthusiastic Player. You make all the prep and scheduling worth it, every single time. You're the reason GMs, DMs, Keepers, Storytellers and Referees will brave the sea of Flakers, Arguers, and Creeps to find a group to play with. You exist, and you deserve every accolade.

8tg142,"Okay, I'm absolutely hooked on Ironsworn's solo gameplay","As someone with no nerdy friends in real life (well, at least not the type of nerd who would play tabletop games), I have read far more rulebooks than I actually get the chance to play. I'm sure that's a familiar story for a lot of you here. Out of frustration, I have in the past tried to get into solo roleplaying but bounced off it. Being particularly bored this week with most of my friends out of town while I'm home working, I decided to give it another go and really drive myself to get into it. 

After spending a good chunk of yesterday evening reading through the surprisingly high-quality Ironsworn manual (available at https://www.ironswornrpg.com/), I decided I was going to spend a couple hours of my day off today, which is usually video-gaming time, to start up a quick solo run to figure out the mechanics.

Instead, I essentially just finished up a 10-hour solo session, where I only took breaks to stretch and eventually go make dinner. This is by *far* the best game designed with solo play in mind that I have ever come across. I'm a little skeptical about how good it would be in the traditional GM-guided format (mostly due to the lack of GM moves), but I haven't tried it. That said, I think the things that I would anticipate being lost from the guided experience are the exact things that tend to hold solo hacks of other games back. Because Ironsworn's GM does very little other than interpreting the narrative and providing story, it's much more easily simulated through oracles than other games. Some examples of things I particularly like:

* Ironsworn's initiative system is pretty straightforward. Either you have initiative, which means you get to act *proactively*, or your opponent has initiative, which means you have to act *reactively*. What's important, though, is that every single interaction comes with a player move. Where a solo gamer would normally have to choose what ""move"" the NPC made on their turn, Ironsworn's mechanics hold that NPC damage is simply a result of failed dice rolls on the player's reactive moves. That means all the solo player has to do is fill in the narrative framing for what exactly that damage looked like. 

* Because Ironsworn is designed for solo play, it has oracles that are setting-specific. This is a pretty minor thing in the big picture, but it has really substantially improved my immersion and oracle use vs. trying to hack something with Mythic.

* Ironsworn's very explicit quest mechanics constantly drive player action forward. You always have either a goal (in the form of an Iron Vow), or the drive to get a goal (and thus take on a quest), because you can only gain experience through the completion of Vows. This provides the forward pressure on the narrative that is normally provided by a GM -- the main problem I've had in solo before is that the narrative often stalls out. Ironsworn's use of varying ranks of Vows (including a huge Background Vow that you may or may not slowly progress on through your game) provide constant direction for the moments where you get lost. If you've fulfilled all your vows, it's either time to retire or it means you've got to go exploring. 

* This game is actually pretty hard. I was really not expecting this, because usually rules-light games have a tendency to be easier, and solo games further have a tendency to be easier due to the unavoidable effects of first-person bias. Ironsworn is basically always beating up your character, however -- something that really drives home the vibe of the game's setting, which is of a resource-scarce land where life is hard and humanity is barely hanging on for life. Three misses on *Undertake a Journey* in a row and you're going to find yourself carefully planning out how to make it to a waypoint where you can rest up without dying. 

* Assets are a pretty cool implementation of a classless system -- wish there were more, though. Their mechanics seem pretty straightforward, so it should be possible to create new ones rather easily, though. Furthermore, they all follow pretty consistent numeric balancing, meaning it should be a good bit harder to accidentally create underpowered/overpowered customs.

* The rulebook is seriously just great. For a completely free game it's very appealing, and I was unironically invested in the outcome of the several story examples presented throughout.

Alright, done ranting now. Just wanted to share because I'm very excited and I can't mention that I played a tabletop game by myself to any of the people I know IRL without getting weird looks. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2aab515b0>,rpg,1529821505.0
6e8ir3,A friendly reminder to the people who recommend Fate whenever anyone asks for a system...,"While Fate can do most genres, so can GURPS, or FU, any number of other universal systems. So the problem isn't ""Can Fate be used for this genre?"" (yes it can) but ""Is Fate the game to provide the experience that OP is looking for?""

The whole Fate point economy makes the game VERY metagamey, and mechanics like compelling other characters makes the game feel a bit like a brainstorming session in the writers' room of a TV show. Also, the system requires you to have lots of story tags on your characters and the world (often written on note cards) which everyone has to keep track of in order to play optimally.

Obviously these can be selling points for plenty of RPGers, but they can be a very unpleasant surprise for a player like me who was expecting a simple system to run any genre (which is how it's often pitched) rather than a high-narrative, low-immersion storygame (which is what it turned out to be).",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2aac33c80>,rpg,1496162818.0

fxr7ah,[DREAD] I adapted/wrote and ran an adventure called “HORRORSTÖR” about an IKEA of Doom,"Hey everyone!

Last fall, I ran a session of DREAD at a con with an adventure that I adapted from “[Horrorstör](https://www.amazon.com/Horrorstor-A-Novel-Grady-Hendrix/dp/1594745269)”, a novel by [Grady Hendrix](https://www.gradyhendrix.com/). Since the session went well, I thought I’d share my prep for others – both as inspiration as well as to get some additional feedback/new ideas if you got any. There’s also some music at the end. Sorry if I missed some typos etc. in the write-up. 

\-------

**ADVENTURE TL;DR**

Employees of a large-scale furniture store get hunted down by Cronenbergian abominations because Corporate wants to increase quarterly profits. 

**MAIN THEMES**

Entrapment, Hopelessness, Annihilation of the Self, Fear of (Social) Decline, Assimilation

**SETTING INFO & PLOT**

“Horrorstör” takes place in a store called ORSK (basically a knock-off IKEA). It’s set in 2009 in an American flyover state, right after the first big shockwave of the last financial crisis. Characters are tasked with finding out the causes of nightly vandalism, only to uncover they’re trapped in the store with something more sinister. 

**THE STORE**

* The local ORSK should feel like an oppressive vault of niceness. Located well outside the nearest town and framed by a lake of cement, this blue-white megastore offers shoppers everything they need to make a space a home. 
* Shoppers are guided through its showroom, market place and self-serving warehouse by a long and winding path that induces retail hypnosis. Even ORSK employees (or “partners”, as they’re called by Corporate) sometimes need to concentrate in order to not get lost. 
* Within its walls, ORSK has no windows, skylights or clocks. Like a casino, it exists in an eternal now. Of course, there’s also little to no cell phone reception.
* Aside from the retail floors, ORSK has a restaurant (whose meatballs are actually quite good) and a Scandinavian Food Market (where no food actually comes from Scandinavia). 
* Behind the scenes, there’s various break rooms, a larger storage warehouse, a basement and freight elevators. There’s one way to the store manager’s offices upstairs above the showroom. 

**THREATS**

* Whereas the threat in the original novel was a \[spin on the supernatural “haunted house” trope\], my adventure features “Projekt Drön” – an attempt by Corporate to create the perfect worker. 
* Drön are pure cyborg bodyhorror. They seem humanoid from a distance (because they once were humans), but land smack-dab in the uncanny valley the closer you get. When Drön speak, they don’t move their mouths. They unhinge their jaws and play pre-recorded stock phrases (“Thank you for shopping at ORSK”, “The store is closing, please proceed to the exit”, “Do you have an ORSK family card?”). 
* As the night progresses, their appearance should become more horrific, with limbs elongating or shortening, muscles bulging obscenely and flesh peeling off, revealing metallic mesh and sinews beneath. They will hunt the players down – your choice either to kill them or use them as raw material to make more Drön.
* The ORSK store should become more and more deadly as the game progresses. Start by cutting off shortcuts in the floor plan, make furniture shatter and fall, have storage racks squash them…

**QUESTIONNAIRES**

I’ve made the player questionnaires look like job application forms for ORSK. 

As it was a con game for a max of 5 players, I kept it short – 12 questions each. 

I started off with *setting questions* (“Why do you wanna work here? ; “What’s your favorite ORSK piece of furniture” ; “How would you describe your work ethos?”), then ventured into *background questions* (“You’re overqualified for this job. Why do you still need it?” ; “What made you leave your hometown so abruptly?” ; “A part of the store lets you shudder. Which one, and why?”), turned the screw towards the personal (“Why wasn’t your mother proud of you?” ; “Why can’t you let others see the real you?”), and finally cranked up the *unease towards Corporate and the feeling of entrapment* (“Why is true that a person’s worth is based on their efficiency?” ; “If a person is dependent on their job, wouldn’t they be well to follow Corporate’s orders?”). 

At the end, players should feel their character’s *inability to just up and quit* – either because there are no better jobs available, or because the neatness of ORSK provides a security blanket for their neurosis or what have you. 

**NPCs**

* Basil, the supervisor (mandatory). Basil loves his job at ORSK, as his benefits pay for his little sister’s medication (he is her sole guardian). Basil also likes the PCs and wants them to succeed. He might get promoted soon, he heard, and would love for one of them to a rise to a higher position as well. Besides the store manager, Basil is the only one in possession of an Override key that can deactivate a store-wide lockdown.
* Matthew (optional), one of the storehouse workers. Ethnically ambiguous. His beard is the last thing a craft beer sees before it dies. Matt has never encountered a conspiracy theory he didn’t like, so you take his ramblings about “corporate replacing us all with automatons” with a grain of salt.
* Trinity Prendergast (optional), co-worker and resident MySpace goth. Her family is \*really\* into pageants, so her look is aimed squarely at riling her mom up. Her first and last act at work is wiping off and reapplying black lipstick, respectively. 
* Ruth Anne, the good soul of this ORSK (optional). She’s been doing odd jobs all her life, with ORSK being by far her favorite. Kind, communal and protective, but can pack a punch when cornered. If she has a vice, it’s strawberry flavored chapstick. Looks like if your older aunt was cosplaying as Dolly Parton.
* Michael, the drifter (optional). Has lost his home, and his family, during the financial crisis and sleeps in the store. Michael can be used as a red herring to explain the strange things during the night… except he’s been here far shorter than those.
* The raccoon (optional). Another red herring for the player’s to find before they encounter the real threat.
* Tom Perssons, CEO of ORSK North America. All-American sweetheart turned corporate. Pomenade and teeth whitener made human. His picture hangs in every ORSK, but no one has actually seen Tom in real life. 

**ADVENTURE STRUCTURE**

**Part I**

After a mysterious shipment of new prototype furniture is delivered, the store suffers from weird acts of nightly vandalisms. Players are tasked with spending an extra night shift to get to the bottom of it. 

In this part, GMs should introduce characters and a general sense of unease towards Corporate. Mention slogans that seem both cheery and ominous at the same time (“ORSK: A home, forever!” ; (“ORSK partners: Our most valuable resource” etc.), “Employees of the Month” that you’ve never seen in the store (they’re either been “promoted” or switched stores) and that despite the spotless façade, your ORSK is in dire need of some repairs. It should also become apparent that ORSK is cutting costs by firing the cleaning and security staff. 

Of course, the mysterious shipment are DRÖN compartments. After they’ve been put in the basement, this part of the store will become off-limits for employees due to a “leak”. Mention a rotting, electrical stench emanating from behind the doors. 

**Part II**

The store shuts down for a national holiday – which means there’s no shoppers or staff coming for a few days. Perfect time to hunt for vandals. Characters get more than what they’ve bargained for. 

Use the first section of this part to (further) develop a sense of camaraderie between characters and introduce the red herring. Generate a feeling of paranoia and uncanniness. Whereas the ORSK is well-lit and pleasant during the day, at night the scenery – with the lights off and no white noise playing – plays with and confuses your senses. 

When players have encountered the red herring and are ready to call it in, guide them towards the store manager’s office. Shortly before they reach it, have the Drön show up first and claim Basil and additional victims, if applicable. End this part of the adventure with players discovering a case file for “Projekt Drön”. 

**Part III**

After discovering the “Projekt Drön” video, characters need to find Basil (or what’s left of him) so they can get the Override switch and escape the ORSK. To do so, they have to cross the floors of ORSK that the Drön have turned into death traps, get into the basement and survive long enough to make it to the exit. 

\------

**DID YOU USE PROPS?**  
Yeah. As I’ve mentioned, the questionnaires looked like job applications; I’ve photoshopped and printed out an actual IKEA Store map. The original “Horrorstör” novel also provides some nifty and appropriately creepy furniture artwork. A quick Google Image search will help you out.   


**WHAT CHANGES DID YOU MAKE FROM THE ORIGINAL NOVEL?**  
The threat, mainly. The original book is basically a>! fun take on the ""haunted house"" trope!<, I thought I'd play up the callousness of Corporate and invented new villains to match my intent.   


**SO WAIT, IS THE TRUE VILLAIN CAPITALISM?**  
Whatever gave you that idea?  


**IS THERE A SPOTIFY PLAYLIST?**

&#x200B;

**If you don't know my work, here's an explanation about who I am and what's my passion :**

I'm a music composer and DM. I always struggled to find high quality ambiences, so I decided to create my own and make them available for free for everyone to use on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MichaelGhelfi?sub_confirmation=1). I strongly believe we needs more than just words to create the most immersive experience for our dear players. Some of us use miniatures, some have cosplays. Me, I use sounds :)

You can find them here : [Ambiences Playlist (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbHUA-o_5dgJbOXwtdVx--gTnmWfiyyys)

**What to expect :**

* Masterfully mixed and mastered (I got the proficiency bonus :))
* Professional quality sounds
* Standardized volume (the more I could) so you don't have to play the DJ while you DM
* **Three** new ambiences per week. On Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. Sometimes I upload songs or VLOGs, but that's rarer.
* They arrive on Spotify as loads of 50 ambiences at once (can't upload more frequently, it costs a lot to upload there)
* Completely free on my YouTube channel
* If you are a streamer or if you make YouTube videos, you can freely monetize your content using my ambiences. I just ask for proper credits, not more ;)

Feel free to ask if you don't find what you need. I'll add your proposition to my TODO list (if it's doable and is useful for all).

If you prefer to download the ambiences, you can get them [here](https://michaelghelfi.bandcamp.com/), but there's no premium content if you pay since I don't want richer people to have any advantage or bonus.

gvwlg4,GM jealousy,"I have a person in my group who is also in another RPG group. I was pretty sure they prefered the other GMs campaign to mine, which at first I was a tiny bit sore about in my heart of hearts, but I got over it because I realized that it was kind of silly. Of course, you can't be everyone's favourite, and there are some awesome GM's out there with many varied styles.

But more recently they relayed a story about telling a story from my campaign to the other GM (who I should add, I've never even met) and it became obvious that the other GM was jealous of me!

I think it might be a common feeling amongst GM's which we keep to ourselves... So I thought I'd open it up to a discussion here.

What are your thoughts on GM jealousy?

Have you experienced it as a GM or player?

**UPDATE 0.3:** 

Better black & white skin

Offline client for Windows (Mac will probably come later)

Multi-language support is on the way (English & French for now). I'll accept contributions when we'll reach the Beta phase :)

Many UI fixes based on your feedback

You can now contribute if you want to pay me a beer by going to the new Itch.io page: [https://deepnight.itch.io/tabletop-rpg-map-editor](https://deepnight.itch.io/tabletop-rpg-map-editor)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

First time for me posting here, so I really hope it won't be received as self-promo spam.

Some background first: I'm a gamedev (worked on **Dead Cells**) but also a huge fan of tabletop RPGs (mostly DD5, Cthulhu & FFG Star Wars recently). But I've always add the same issue when making scenarios as a GM: it's easy to use stuff like GoogleDocs for the text part, but making maps always was an issue for me. In *my opinion*, most tools have either terrible UI, ergonomics or ugly look and it was hard finding something **light** and **efficient** at the same time.

So years ago I decided to make my own tool which was Flash based.

&#x200B;

Recently, I've release a whole new version of this tool which gets rid of Flash, but also integrates the tons of feedback previous users gave to me, such as special walls, lightings, ground textures and so on.

Here it is: [https://deepnight.net/tools/rpg-map/](https://deepnight.net/tools/rpg-map/)

&#x200B;

**Important**: my goal is to build a **light & simple tool**, for the GM to quickly draw maps for its campaign of *whatever* RPG. That's why you will never see furniture like Beds or Tables, but more generic things like rectangles. I try to stay **RPG agnostic** here.

All your feedback will be super valuable to me :)

&#x200B;

**Note**: it's still an *Alpha*, so expect changes and I can't guarantee the future compatibility of your created maps for now (not before *Beta* phase).

Stuff I plan to implement in the future:

* Downloadable Windows executable (not sure about a downloadable Mac version yet)
* Support for importing TSV files (any other format I should know about?)
* Water/lava/acid pools
* More skins, ground textures, icons & furniture
* Multi-language support (English/French at first)
* Open-source on GitHub",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ab37e4e0>,rpg,1558174305.0
2vehsh,I'm a GM who kicked half his players out of the group... and I couldn't be happier with the results.,"I've been running a GURPS campaign that takes place in a semi-steampunk fantasy world of my own design. It's the first campaign I've ever run as a GM, and I chose GURPS because it seemed like the best choice for what I was trying to do. Most of the time I had six players, but three of them were guilty of being ""that guy"" in three different ways, so I stopped inviting them. Now my campaign is the best it's ever been and we're all happy. Now let me tell you why.



One of the players, who I'll refer to as ""snake girl,"" was really proud of being a sex-addicted warrior woman with a pet snake. That would have been cool, if it weren't for the fact that she never brought anything to the table besides that. She never showed any interest in the game world, quests, or anything beyond wanting to shag every NPC on their airship crew and asking if her snake can bite someone in combat. Even that would have been ok, if not for the fact that she also spent most of the time talking about off topic stuff, singing, yelling out memes, and trying to get the Senpai of the group to notice her. Most of the time she couldn't catch anything that was actually going on with the campaign, because she didn't pay attention until there was combat and it was her character's turn.



The other ""that guy"" was much worse. Imagine having a rules lawyer who isn't particularly good at rules or being a lawyer. Of course, most players understand that phrase ""the GM is always right,"" and GURPS even says that it's ok to change things for the sake of a campaign. This guy didn't seem to get that. He would bring the GURPS rulebook to every session and keep it open, and any time I made a ruling that might not benefit him, he'd say something like ""Oh, let me look that up,"" then turn to the appropriate page in the book to ""check"" and see what I should have done. If I've contradicted the default rules (or if I didn't, but he misread them and thought I did), he'd ""correct"" me and narrate what should have happened instead, which is awfully stupid considering that often times he's looking up rules that I've purposely changed or omitted for the sake of our game. Every time he did this, he'd break the flow of the game and ruin everyone's immersion, in addition to causing further confusion for the rest of the players (even when simplified, GURPS has a lot to it). It got pretty aggravating having someone constantly questioning everything I do and undermining my authority as a GM. He also seemed to get off on frequently interrupting me to ask questions that put me on the spot, like ""What's the name of the preferred dish in this town?"" or ""what does the engine room of their airship look like? I ask them to let me explore it!"" Often times he'd be disrupting actual story content to do this. I had a talk with him, but he didn't seem to get it. He just claimed he was trying to help me ""grow as a GM."" On top of that, his character was a total ripoff of the eels guy from The Mighty Boosh, and his in-character behavior consisted almost entirely of talking about eels and asking for eels while doing that guy's voice. That got old very fast, and his character had no value in the party or the campaign.



Our last ""that guy"" was a stoner who had to be high as a kite every time we played. His character was a ""Nazi scientist"" in a world without Nazis, and he showed little interest in acting like a functional member of the party; he was just one of those ""look at what a character I am"" characters. He wanted to turn people into zombies, so I tried making it fun for him by having him occasionally find devices that would allow him to do that, but he was too high to ever actually pick up on it. The worst, though, was when the players were fighting an epic battle onboard a pirate ship, and an unexpected challenge appeared. Even though everyone else was willing to rise up to the challenge, he got really pissed off and started yelling at me about how that's so unfair, how it's not physically possible (he's a self-proclaimed physicist), and I'm totally trying to get the whole party killed (no...). It was impossible to continue the game at that point; he basically shut it down, and he never apologized for that outburst. He just told me on Facebook later on that what I did was ""fucking retarded.""




So what did I do? I stopped inviting Snake Girl, Rules Lawyer *and* Stoner Boy, and have been continuing the campaign with the three people I have left. The fun factor has improved more than a thousand times over! Now our game sessions are all roleplaying, character development, plot advancement and a splash of fun, easily manageable combat. The three players I have left work as a team, Three Musketeers-style, and have thrilling in-character banter as they make important decisions, execute daring maneuvers, and deal with the situations I present them with in interesting ways. Most importantly, they're having more fun now and are accessing the game world and the game system with greater ease. I no longer have to spend any time fighting to keep everyone's attention; I don't have to worry about narrating something that will remind them of a meme that they have to shout out, and we spend 0 time fussing about the rules or arguing about technicalities. For having fun in a table top RPG, good players are just as important as a good GM.




If you're a GM who suffers from having one or more ""that guy"" in your group making you miserable, you should seriously consider leaving them in the dust, for the sake of your campaign and for the players you like. And if you're a player who's guilty of any of the annoying and disruptive behaviors similar to what I've described (rules lawyering, undermining the GM, or derailing the game just to share dank memes), you may want to change your ways quick - or before you know it, you might just stop being welcome at that table.




TL;DR: Players - don't be That Guy. GMs: Don't tolerate That Guy. Stop inviting him; you'll be happier, and the rest of your players will thank you for it.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ab469790>,rpg,1423560284.0

lzs60b,Is it valid to enjoy RPG without much role-playing?,"When I was much younger than I am now, I used to really enjoy RPGs. Things I remember liking about them include:

* beating the challenges presented by combat encounters;
* creative problem-solving and investigative work in non-combat situations;
* sense of progression as my character levels up and becomes more powerful;
* (as a secondary consideration) witnessing the story-telling and the world-building done by the GM, and possibly doing some of that myself at my own pace.

At the same time, I specifically did not (and do not now) enjoy role-playing and (for lack of a better term) being charismatic. I prefer to have conversations out-of-character, at least at my end (e.g. I'd prefer to say ""I greet the NPC"" as opposed to saying ""I turn to NPC and say *'Hello!'*""; I don't have a strong preference as to whether GM replies ""The NPC greets you back"" or ""The NPC says *'Hello, traveller!'*"".). I like the fact that I can in principle have an elaborate back-story, but it's important to me that I'm allowed to keep it to a bare minimum (""I was orphaned when I was a child, a wizard took me in as his apprentice, now I'm ready to go adventuring.""). I get mildly uncomfortable when GM asks me to describe in detail what my outfit looks like or how I strike the finishing blow in a combat situation, especially when this has no effect on the mechanics of the game.

I've recently been trying to get back into RPGs, and in several unrelated instances in a row I encountered people who emphasise the role-playing/charismatic aspects of the game over the parts that I personally enjoy, and haven't yet had much luck with finding like-minded people. Since my experience with RPGs is limited and mostly set far in the past, this makes me question: *Is my approach to RPGs even valid?* Is it reasonable for me to hope to find a group whose play-style better fits my preferences, or should I just accept that RPGs are fundamentally different than what I enjoy? Are my preferences a matter of a legitimate difference in tastes, or am I simply being unsophisticated and/or misguided?

(In some basic sense, I'm aware that my preferences are obviously valid, in the sense that anything is valid if everyone involved is having fun. An analogy that comes to mind: There is nothing wrong with liking fast-food more than French cuisine, just like there is nothing wrong with liking Indian cuisine more than French cuisine. However, if I expressed these two preferences, I would expect rather different responses. I'm basically asking whether in this analogy I'm a fast-food enthusiast or an Indian food enthusiast.)

Any insight would be very much appreciated!

Also, just to pre-empt the obvious comment: Yes, I am quite aware that ""RP"" in RPG stands for ""role-playing"" ;)

EDIT TO ADD: I'd like to clarify one point in which I might have not expressed myself clearly. While I do enjoy combat, I also very much enjoy non-combat related activities. I'm not specifically looking to hack and slash. Conducting an investigation or solving a riddle or resolving a conflict are also definitely things I like. I'm just more excited about figuring the solution from 3rd person perspective than in role-playing the interactions that are involved in it.

Also, thank you for all the responses!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ab6f7680>,rpg,1615128928.0
bi4e5d,My first game as a GM had 42 players,"I'm a French computer engineering student (I hope, by the way, that my English is not too bad) and I went, in 2017, in Thailand for an internship in a Thai engineering school. I was there with two French friends of mine, whom I will call Lisa and Rachel, and we were the three only French in an 41-people Thai class. Lisa was a GM and was the one person who gave me the passion for tabletop RPG, and Rachel had never played any tabletop RPG game yet.

&#x200B;

One of our classes was an oral expression class, about how to properly speak to an assembly. One of the simple exercises was to explain to the other students our hobbies. During my presentation, I told that I liked tabletop RPGs ; at the end, the teacher asked me what ""RPG"" was. I was like ""Yeah he is about 40, of course he doesn't know!"" and I started explaining (for 20 minutes), when I understood that there wasn't any student who had ever heard about RPGs.

&#x200B;

During the next week, with Lisa and Rachel we were like ""Wow that's funny, RPGs absolutely don't exist here! Maybe we can ask to Thai students if they want to try one day!""

&#x200B;

At the end of the next expression class, we asked the teacher if we could offer students to join us in a RPG initiation. He said of course, and we told the class that we were willing to give to some students an opportunity to try tabletop RPG, so if like 6 people wanted to try, that was the occasion. The teacher immediately asked us if we wanted to take half an hour in the next class to play with the students to show them, as RPG could be considered as an expression exercise. We said that it would be an honor, but half an hour is kinda short. The teacher gave us 1 hour of the next class to play.

&#x200B;

r/WTF is happening right now

&#x200B;

We spent the whole next week to figure out how to make an 1-hour game with 43 people (with Lisa and Rachel among the players, and I as the GM). We came up with a really simple rule system to explain in 5 minutes, with 7 characters played by 6 people each, and the choice between 4 scenarios :

\- The Mansion : an old abandonned mansion filled with monsters and traps contains a princess to free. Very classical, maybe the best to discover tabletop RPG (a very simple scenario, I know, but we had 1 hour including rules teaching)

\- The Arena : the characters are thrown in an arena to fight monsters, then to kill each other in order to win (more fight-oriented)

\- The lighthouse : the players are harpoon fishers whose boat sank near an abandonned lighthouse hiding an old scientific lair with a big monster inside : the goal is to find a radio emitter to call a nearby boat

\- The psychopath : a very dirty game where the players are chased down by a psychopath in his house, have almost no weapon and try to find a way out

&#x200B;

At the beginning of the next class, the teacher said that he wanted to give us the full 4-hours class to play ( r/thatescalatedquickly). The students chose the Mansion scenario and we played for 4 hours maybe the funniest but most tiring game of my life.

&#x200B;

Playing with 42 unexperienced people is VERY hard. The first thing they did was to split in the mansion (so I had to improvise 7 paths in the mansion (one per character instead of one for the group)), so I had to call Lisa to become a second GM to help me, they did some very bad choices (luring a giant spider to close combat when you are a crossbowman, then setting it on fire when it is laying on you, for example), but some outstanding moves (because managing 42 fully-working brains is almost impossible without being outsmarted, even with unexperimented players).

&#x200B;

At the end, they saved the princess but sacrified 3 team members to do so, therefore I think the game was kind of balanced :)

&#x200B;

It was very tiring but I will remember this my whole life ; most of them loved it even if they found that 42 players was a bit too much (very true) and I hope they will remember and spread the concept!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ab70a240>,rpg,1556403885.0

dkvjkv,My space marine killed a hive tyrant during a blood rain,"I just finished the most metal rpg session ever.

We were playing DeathWatch, an RPG set in the warhammer 40k universe, where we played Space Marines  Super Soldiers. We were playing the introduction mission, which was to save a tech-priest from a collonised planet infested by Tyranids (basically aliens from the Aliens franchise) before their hiveships made it to the planet.

The cast is:
Assault Marine (me, melee fighter)
Tactical Marine (gun marine)
Psyker Marine (magic user)

We found the Tech-Priest without too many problems. The Psyker Marine killed a horde of Tyranids while Tactical Marine and me brought the Tech-Priest back, and Tactical Marine killed two Tyranid Warriors by himself. We fought our way up a tower against hordes of Tyranids with Bolters, Grenades and Chainswords. It was going great... Until we got to the top of the tower to wait for our extraction.

The roof of the tower explodes to a milion pieces as a Hive Tyrant erupts from the floor under us. A Hive Tyrant is basically like an Alien Queen, but much more nasty. We fought against it, using all of our strongest abilities from the stsrt to even hope to survive. But it lived. In the next two rounds, it ripped of the arm of the Tactical Marine and almost killed the Psyker Marine. Then the Psyker Marine unleashed all the power of the Warp while the Tactical Marine shot Hellfire rounds at the Hive Tyrant, dealing incredible amounts of damage.

But in unleashing the Warp, the Psyker Marine started a storm, and the storm rained blood down on the top of the tower. Then the Hyve Tyrant attacked me, but I managed to parry it with my Chainsword. At this point, the only thing I could do was to try to charge the beast and roll really high to have any hope to damage it. I do so. I hit.

Righteous Fury. This game version of a critical hit. If you manage to roll max damage, you can roll damage again, and add it to the damage of the attack, which ignores armor. So I roll damage for the basic attack, then for the Righteous Fury... Righteous Fury again. Roll damage... RIGHTEOUS FUCKING FURY. I ended up rolling damage 4 times against the Hive Tyrant, and, thank the Emperor, it was enough to kill it.

Now the GM narrates how I manage to block the strike from the huge claw and chop off the arm of the beast. He narrates as I plunge the Chainsword inside the Hive Tyrant’s abdomen, tearing blood, sinew and gore out of it’s body. He narrates how I activate my Jump Pack, and as the thrusters roar with flames, I charge forward, pushing the Hive Tyrant back to the edge of the tower. He narrates how the Hive Tyrant screams as I rip out my Chainsword out from its guts, and kick him off of the tower. And he narrates how the Hive Tyrant falls down the tower, screaming, and how he crashes down on the ground, as my Battle Brothers and I watch from the top of the tower, being rained down upon by a rain of blood.

We manage to hold off the rest of the Horde while we wait for our extraction to come, and we manage to get in and leave. Our mission accomplished.

You can't even go on r/indierpg anymore. It's nothing but ads. I mean, I'm not trying to get in the way of someone's hustle, but when you literally see more shills than content, it's just too much. Not to mention, most shills only contribute when they are shilling. There's already a specifically RPG promo sub somewhere. Is there a place for RPGs where it's just RPG talk? Or, can I filter out posts by flair? Thanks!

Edit: this has been amusing. I wasn't suggesting that shills be banned. I was just looking for a better way to screen them out to improve my own ux. It only goes to show how the shills dominate the sub when such a question gets so heavily downvoted.

Edit#2: wait, there's an upswing from the community and I'm now at 7 upvotes. Was the first round the shills descending upon me and now the real people are showing up? 😁

Edit #3: Thanks to u/sheldonbunny for keeping me honest. For those of you who want to know how to block the shills and don't want to filter through a crap ton of comments for the answer, right on the sidebar, if you scroll all the way down to ""Hide Topics"" and click ""Product Promotion"", you'll get a new window with the sub but all the Crowdfunding and Self-Promotion content is basically gone. If you would like to read an internet train smash, please proceed to the comments. Thanks and have a great day!

Edit #4: Wow, I just passed 100 upvotes! You all make me feel like a goddamn 'merican hero. Unless you don't like Americans, then I'm Canadian. With that in mind, you only have 24 hours left to fund the final stretch goal for my original RPG, Goddamn American Heroes!

ly8aa6,"The Term ""Roleplay Heavy"" Sucks, and You Probably Mean ""Social Interaction Heavy""","I wrote a blog post called [The Exclusion of Combat from ""Roleplaying""](https://austin-tinkel.com/the-exclusion-of-combat-from-roleplaying/) in which I discussed the use of the term ""roleplay heavy"" in game advertisements on sites like Roll20 and /r/lfg.

In summary, I notice that a lot of people describe their (especially D&D) games as ""roleplay heavy"" when they actually mean ""social interaction heavy"". This has led to a lot of frustration for me that so many people don't consider combat as part of roleplaying.

I personally hate game sessions that involve just sitting around talking in character for 3 hours. I would much rather have swashbuckling action and high stakes danger than a slower, more personal game. However, the current popular definition of roleplay would imply that action-oriented games are lacking in roleplay, to which I very much disagree.

I think a better way to describe game style is with genre descriptions and specific examples from popular media.

What do you think? Am I just an old man yelling at a cloud about meaningless semantics or do others share this frustration?

Edit: Okay, it seems like my clickbait-y title is giving off the wrong impression here. What I really just want is more clear descriptions of what kind of game the GM is going to run. I don't like having to leave games because I get bored, I would rather know up front what kind of game it is so I don't waste anyone's time. I think there are better words and terms for the types of games people play. In my experience, things like ""roleplay heavy"" just don't convey enough information to make an informed decision and lead to more questions than answers about the particulars of the game experience. I think genre descriptions and media examples go a long way in rectifying this. I'm not trying gatekeep what actually counts as ""roleplay"" or anything like that.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ac3530b0>,rpg,1614936517.0

ilx5hn,A List of RPG’s I’d Recommend Everyone to Check Out Once,"I don’t know if I used be proper flair, but couldn’t find a better one to use. Anyways, I made a list on a separate sub to recommend to someone and thought I’d share here. Hope you enjoy!

- The obligatory **DnD** and **Pathfinder**, although I’d note that DnD 4e and 5e are VERY different and so I’d recommend looking into both. Pathfinder also just released a new edition, but both play fairly similarly. If you’re looking for vast character creation options though then Pathfinder 1e is the way to go, an “Arcade-like” or a gaming RPG-like experience would best represent DnD 4e (in terms of powers and gameplay), and then DnD 5e has become a classic yet Pathfinder 2e is seemingly more optimized. 
- **Monster Hearts (1 & 2)** is a Fueled/Powered by the Apocalypse game *(meaning it uses the Apocalypse World engine)*. Very heavily based off of Buffy, this game is about being a teenager (or young adult, your choice) coming to grips with growing up, maybe dealing with hormones, and also dealing with the fact you’re a *literal* monster. Be the territorial Werewolf on the football team, the hive-minded Queen who runs the school, maybe the punk-rock Witch plotting their revenge, or even the love-stuck Mortal who can’t help but be drawn to the dark. *(This game is actually made by Avery Alder, a queer woman who heavily involves LGBTQ themes in most of her work).*
- **The Quiet Year** (also made by Alder, check out Buried Without Ceremony for all of her games) is a game about rebuilding after an apocalypse. Using only a deck of cards, a map, some coloring tools. and your own creativity you’ll watch your settlement grow and develop projects while exploring the devastated area, meanwhile preparing for the Winter ahead when the Harbingers appear. Very open-ended and a variety of levels of play available.
- **Monster of the Week** is heavily reminiscent of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Supernatural, and even in a way Stranger Things. Similar to Monster Hearts, but superior in it’s own ways. This isn’t so much about being the monster as it is *SLAYING* the monster. A great alternative to Monsterhearts if you want to love away from the highschool hormones. 
- The **World/Chronicles of Darkness** games are set in a dark and gritty supernatural world that resembles our own. There is a core book set but also tons of focuses with Vampires, Werewolves, Mages, Giests *(like OP Mediums)*, Changelings *(people taken and warped by the Fae)*, and more. A game about what it means to be human, and what you do when you’re not... *(Note: Older books are under “World of Darkness” and newer ones are under “Chronicles of Darkness”. Feel free to look more into why that is.)*
- **Legacy: Among the Ruins** is a multi-generational game about a struggling society, where you’ll not only control one large family or world-faction but also individual characters of said faction over time as different key players emerge within your campaign’s timeline.
- **Masks** is another game Fueled/Powered by the Apocalypse except this time you’re playing as a young and hopefully hero who has to manage their relationships, ensure their own survival, face the unique drawbacks of their powers, while also “doing the right thing”.
- **City of Mist** asks the question “What if you were secretly the embodiment of some famous figure, real or fake? Like... Arthur Pendragon? Alice in Wonderland? Or maybe even Robinson Crusoe?” and then immediately answers it. You live in a city where most, of not everyone, has forgotten their alternate selves, and where you are among the few who have shaken that fog from your mind and must balance regaining your past self while holding on to who you are now. 
- **Kult: Divinity Lost** takes supernatural horror to an entirely new level. This is a world of blood, darkness, madness, and worse. A game about humanity’s lost divinity and how reality is but a prison. Think Hellraiser, meets Lovecraft, meets the darkest fairy tales and darkest urban legends you’ve ever heard... and then make it worse. 
- **Apocalypse World** is the birthplace and origin of the Apocalypse Engine used in many games today (and many on this list too!) It streamlines the mechanical processes of the game making for faster gameplay, sacrifices no depth, and actually emphasizes the importance of your character’s experiences and relationships in many tangible ways. A great game with a great system to boot.
- **Dungeon World** is a game that skips all the deep mechanical complexity of games like DnD and Pathfinder and instead is Fueled/Powered by the Apocalypse. You make your adventurer, build up your relationships to your party, and dive on in to a world full of potential! 
- **Burning Wheel** is oddly reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings setting, and plays out in a system more complex than any other system I’ve described above. It’s core tenets revolving around a wheel and your character’s symbolic attachment to it. How your character has the core of the wheel, their attributes the spikes that turn, and the outer rim their manifestation upon the world. A great thought process to go through *(if you can get past the combat section!)*
- **FATE** is going to be the final contribution, it’s less of a game and more of an immensely open system for you to use to make nearly any sort of setting for a game you want. It has many books and modules, but it’s biggest asset is just how freeform and adaptable it is, yet still remaining balanced. Truly gets to that age-old idea of role playing games being the embodiment of “playing pretend as kids but actually playing fairly”.
- **Dream Askew** is another Avery Alder game that centers around an enclave of survivors holding out against the forces of a psychic wasteland. With gangs, beasts, and the psychic maelstrom hounding at your doors how will you be able to find love, peace, and hope amongst your fellow misfits?
- **Paranoia** is set in a dystopian sci-fi world where you are a Troublshooter in a futuristic city overseen by The Computer. Do your best to fit into The Computer’s “perfect society” while dealing with the constant threat of The Outdoors, the Communists, Mutants, Secret Societies *(especially... The Communists!)*, and be sure to NEVER disappoint The Computer! It resembles bleak dystopian novels such as 1984, Brave New World, and THX 1138 all the while keeping a tone of dark comedy and tongue-in-cheek humor.
- **Ten Candles** is a game set in a survival horror setting where survival just isn’t an option. A darkness has enveloped the sky, and the faint flickering of light is your only hope. This game is not suited for digital play, as you and your fellow doomed companions will develop your characters and literally burn away your “character sheet” over the course of your game, representing the sacrifices you’ll make just to die in the dark. A unique factor is that 10 candles are lit during the whole play time, and as each scene ends in misfortune a candle will be extinguished, and if your last candle goes out *(by you blowing it out or simply by burning down to the wick)* then it’s game over.
- **Dread** is another game best suited for actual table-top gameplay. Here you and your friends play as the main cast straight out of a horror film, with each move and decision you make being represented by the pull of a block from an ever increasingly unstable Jenga Tower... that’s right, the core mechanic here is a Jenga Tower. An innovative application on the stress inducing family classic, this game has a hard rule in it that if a character knocks over the tower while making their pull... *they’re dead.* 
- **Fiasco** seems to perfectly capture the whacky, zany, and interconnected nature so common in the greatest stories told time and time again. Choose a setting book, get out a BUNCH of D6’s, your index cards, and some pens/pencils because this is a game about acting! You’ll establish your characters traits/connections with an initial partially-random roll of the dice and by using the scene-specific tables provided. You’ll establish the exposition with your fellow cast mates, and then go on to act out scenes with your co-stars hoping to get what you want and to get it good! You’ll start each scene by either determine the outcome of the scene or establish what the scene is about while your fellow players choose the other option for you. Collect a pool of Black and/or White dice throughout the game, survive the TILT TABLE, make it through the climax and... well, you may get out with some of your limbs still attached? *(This game is truly best explained by watching TableTop’s episodes on this game.)*
- **Shadowrun** takes place in a potential future of our own reality where magic reawakens in the modern day, causing the resurgence of otherworldly entities, the use of Magic by mage and shaman alike, with some people transforming *(or “goblinizing”) into Elves, Dwarves, Trolls, and more all while featuring the oppressive forces of a future corporate world structure. Where a company and a government are synonymous to one another, and where the internet is more like “VR, but deadly” with programs that can fry your meat-self if you go hacking in the wrong areas. But here you’ll play as a Shadowrunner, a hired hand among the SINless, CEO’s, and worse. You’ll make enemies everywhere, and be allowed almost nowhere. *Welcome to the Shadow...* 
- **Call of Cthulhu** is LITERALLY a game all about Lovecraftian horror. You’ll have hours of fun watching as your character’s mind skips further into insanity, clinging to all kinds of harmful habits like sex, drugs, and self-destructive behavior before slowly snapping and killing everyone you loved... oh, and that’s a *good* outcome! You don’t even want to know what would happen if you got even a glimpse at Shub-Niggurath’s left pinkie toe! *(.... do abstract cosmic horrors comprised of tentacles even have pinkie toes???)*
- **Little Fears** sees you in the role of a small child being hunted by creatures who want to drag you into Closetland. But this isn’t some David Bowie musical fever dream! This is a world fueled on the eternal torment and fear of children warped and anguishing at the hands of the Seven Kong’s and their ruler, the Demagogue. The only thing that shields them from these horrors *(such as The Monster Under the Bed, Werewolves, Bogeymen, or even Baba Yaga)* is a special form of magic called Belief. And don’t think you can run and tell your parents, they can’t see Closetland anymore, and they can’t remember it either. And some day... neither will you.
- **Ex Novo** is a free print-and-play game (with pdf versions available literally right now) that facilitates the building of a city by drawing its components in a map. It can be played solo, and has just as much use for developing towns for your own settings as it is fun to play with.
- **Microscope** is a game all about making one big picture and then slowly zooming in more and more... what’s this picture of? It’s an image of an entire world and it’s history. You and a few players will start with a general concept and gradually expand it outwards, allowing you to have a world of whatever depth you like and that can be adjusted how you each see fit. What’s even better is that this fun game, beyond serving as a great exercise in creativity and cooperation, can even help you make your own settings for games, books, or whatever else have you!

Last year, I designed an odd little ttrpg called [**FAKE CHESS**](https://spc.itch.io/fakechess).  It's a game *about* playing chess; players of the game *act* like champion players in a fiery chess match.  It's a very silly RPG/LARP/boardgame hybrid, and sneers at the seriousness & pretentious severity that surrounds ""the game of kings.""

This week, I released a sequel, [**FAKE CHESS: BOOK OF CHAMPIONS**](https://spc.itch.io/fakechess2).   Now, players can take on specific roles that play with pop culture's iconic chess players, both historical and fictional.

AND [**DICEBREAKER**](https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/fake-chess/news/fake-chess-book-champions) gave it a write-up!  (For a part-time, one-person, extremely DIY operation, this really felt big & exciting.)

If you're interested in checking out the games, the links are above!

Also: Economic accessibility is *extremely* important to me.  If you're interested but unable to afford the game, please help yourself to a free community copy.  And if community copies are gone, send me a message and I'll shoot you a download key, no questions asked.

Edit: the discord is a great resource for lancer related questions and LFG stuff, here's a link: https://discord.gg/D7YGAV3

From the .IO page:

***Lancer*** **imagines a future where a survivor humanity has spread to the stars** after weathering terrible ecological collapse on Earth - the end of the Anthropocene as a consequence of unrestrained consumption and poor stewardship. Five thousand years later, humanity lives in the wake of a desperate revolution, one where the victorious radicals now manage the galaxy they've won.    


The setting features a mix of gritty, mud-and-lasers military science fiction and mythic science fantasy, where  conscript pilots mix ranks with flying aces, mercenary guns-for-hire brawl with secretive corpro-state agents, and relativistic paladins cross thermal lances with causality-breaking, unknowable beings. *Lancer*'s galaxy is one where utopia exists, but is under threat, and the struggle is not yet entirely won; the revolution is not yet done. 

In *Lancer,* players adopt the roles of mechanized chassis pilots - mech pilots - comrades together in a galaxy of danger and hope. Some groups will fight to rectify the crimes of previous administrations; others will fight for their nation,  pieces in a greater game of hegemony. Others will carry the banner of a corpro-state or mercenary company, working to advance private interests while lining their pockets. Others still will fight for groups acting in opposition to those in power - for the underground, for the forgotten, agents of entropy and agents of yet more radical revolutions. 

*Lancer* offers deep, modular mech customization, a wide range of player backgrounds and hooks to prompt storytelling, and a system and setting with room for any narrative you and your group want to tell. It’s best with a group of 3-5 players, and can be used to run a one-shot session or persistent campaign. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ac5c2990>,rpg,1575060937.0

bn0g4a,Rewrite of Dogs in the Vineyard,"Basically every time anyone in this subreddit asks what rpg to use for a particular game, my suggestion is a hack of **Dogs in the Vineyard**, because it's my favorite system. Years ago, some friends and I used a hack of it to run a JoJo's Bizarre Adventure game, and since then I've used the system to run dozens of games in various copyrighted universes, as well as things of my own creation.

At Gen Con every year I run a new one-shot using my hack, and last year several people asked me if my setting was published. And considering I spent several months writing it, I figured I should look into doing that. So I emailed the guy (Vincent Baker, of Apocalypse World fame) who wrote the game originally, asking for permission to publish my campaign as long as I include a link to purchase DitV. 

He responded more or less immediately, with bad news. Unfortunately, DitV is out of print so I could not do that. However, he told me that the only thing copyrighted are his actual words, and what I *should* do is rewrite the whole thing and publish it as my own.

So that's what I did! Meet **DOGS**, the **D**ice pool and m**O**ral predicament based **G**eneric roleplaying **S**ystem!

tc4d1w,"If you're a player and you're having fun, tell your GM!","I'm a new GM to a party of 4 friends, of which 3 are new players. I've been wanting to play some TTRPG with my friends for literally ages, but it never worked out. I've studied multiple systems but never got to play anything. 

Recently, one of my friends started watching some streams by this famous Brazilian streamer who has his own horror investigation TTRPG system. I saw this as an opportunity to convince her to play something with me and another friend who's a veteran to play with us. We eventually got another 2 friends to join us. They have no idea of what's RPGs actually are, but they both love literature, storytelling, and acting, so I thought they'd be a good fit. I decided City of Mist would be the best game for the party even though it's not one I'm particularly familiar with.

So now I have a player who has only watched professional streams and therefore has expectations, two who have no idea of what they're getting into, and one who has ONLY played D&D before. As a completely new DM, I'm absolutely terrified about running this table, and as an anxious overthinker, it's hard not to think that I'm going to mess up, and they will never want to play again. 

A few minutes ago, the player who watches streams sent me an audio message of her saying she's really excited for the game to start, a picture of a pile of post-its with character ideas and a pinterest link with a bunch of references to her character's appearance. You may call me a crybaby, but that almost made me cry. This is something I've wanted for so long and was terrified I wouldn't be able to play again because players gave up (which has happened the other two times I tried to set up a table). But now I'm so excited to play with them, and it really makes me want to work hard to give them a good game.

Moral of the unnecessarily long story: If you're a player and you're excited about your game, tell your GM so! It feels so rewarding to hear you're entertained and interested. GMing can be a lot of work, and sometimes prepping is not particularly fun, but it really makes it worthy to hear a player saying they are having a good time!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ac81bc80>,rpg,1647045307.0

14eukg9,I dislike ignoring HP,"I've seen this growing trend (particularly in the D&D community) of GMs ignoring hit points. That is, they don't track an enemy's hit points, they simply kill them 'when it makes sense'.


I never liked this from the moment I heard it (as both a GM and player). It leads to two main questions:


1. Do the PCs always win? You decide when the enemy dies, so do they just always die before they can kill off a PC? If so, combat just kinda becomes pointless to me, as well as a great many players who have experienced this exact thing. You have hit points and, in *some* systems, even resurrection. So why bother reducing that health pool if it's never going to reach 0? Or if it'll reach 0 and just bump back up to 100% a few minutes later?


2. Would you just kill off a PC if it 'makes sense'? This, to me, falls **very** hard into railroading. If you aren't tracking hit points, you could just keep the enemy fighting until a PC is killed, all to show how strong BBEG is. It becomes less about friends all telling a story together, with the GM adapting to the crazy ides, successes and failures of the players and more about the GM curating their own narrative.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ac9b5ac0>,rpg,1687313772.0

The set itself was not - almost every die had a sever cosmetic flaw or manufacturing defect (tool-marks/scoring on the metal that did not buff off with optical cloth, etc per their care instructions for grease or fingerprints, or thin/unpainted spots on many of the ampersand-faces). I've posted a few examples here:


https://imgur.com/gallery/wzxOUNg


Trying to get these replaced by Wizards has been like pulling teeth - it would have been faster and easier to demand a refund and order a whole new set. After several emails back and forth with customer service, I got a shipping label for my return and sent them back. I got email notification  that my dice had been received and a new set would be shipped soon and then... nothing. After weeks of waiting and getting no notice or shipping information, I emailed asking for an ETA or info on what was going on, but kept getting cursory responses that I would get shipping information when my replacements were sent. After more than a month, I requested escalation of my issue to a manger (which had to be made twice before I could get a reply)and got the following boilerplate reply a few days after my final request:


""Unfortunately, at this time, we do not have any updates to provide regarding the shipping information for your replacement order. Our team is currently processing a significantly higher number of replacement requests that usual right now, and we are assisting customers in the order that requests were received. Do note that, as soon as your replacement order has been processed and shipped, you will receive an automatic email with tracking information for your replacement"".

*EDIT - I just got a message from Mike Mearls inquiring after this issue. He's indicated he'll be looking into it personally himself when people are in the office Monday. I definitely didn't expect contact from WotC to come from these posts, and I definitely appreciate that this was made visible enough for them to do so. I'll update when I hear more
Further attempts at requesting more information, explanations or escalation have been ignored so far.


As of 11/28/20, I am still without a product I purchased in August or any idea of when I will get a new set (and with some dread a new set will be just as flawed/damaged, putting me back in this same cycle). I understand the current situation means shipping and response times may be slowed in every industry, but this ammout of delay in turnaround (while the company still has my money), without being able to provide estimated fulfillment dates  or even an idea of where a request is in the queue... it's appallingly poor customer service to say the least, especially when Wizards seems to be having no issue fulfilling other orders (new books and the like seem to be shipping out at a normal pace, despite Covid). As Wizards refuses to be forthcoming with anything further, I'm forced to spread my experience to every public forum possible and warn others away from buying these while I look into other avenues of complaint (eg, with Hasbro).",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ac9e7f20>,rpg,1606617213.0

A couple months ago we realized just how expensive it is to order delivery pizza or run to a fast food joint during the game for dinner. 

One of my players suggested bringing a dish instead, and we started taking turns each bringing an easy crock-pot dish or casserole and the rest of the group provides sides and dessert. 

We are saving so much money, eating healthier, and all learning to expand our cooking knowledge. It brings us together, and there is something so special about eating a meal that a friend prepared for you. 

Another odd practical note is that as the GM I've noticed that after eating a meal that isn't full of bread and sugar my whole party seems more alert and engaged. No one is in a food coma.

kx95gh,Hero Quest inspired RPG designed for introducing RPGs to your family (And It's free),"10 years ago, I wanted to play D&D with my nephews but they were only 6, so I made my own lightweight RPG using spell cards and item cards like hero quest. The Quickstart is just 2 pages.

**The Story**:A world made of 10 elements is entering the renaissance era, driven by magic and technology. As a wielder of one of those elements, explore the world of Alterra, fight off dragons, or discover forgotten relics.

**The core combat mechanics**: Spells always hit but the damage is rolled.Weapons roll 10+ to hit, but always deal a flat amount of damage. And players roll to dodge instead of enemies rolling to hit. There are no modifiers which means we're doing about 1/4 of the computations per action.

akjt7z,How have I never heard of this before?,"One of my players in my play-by-post game messaged me today with a link to [Kanka](https://kanka.io/en-US), an online bookkeeping program for RPGs. It immediately struck me as the missing link between our Roll20 maps and our Discord chat server.

&#x200B;

Here are a few highlights:

* It organizes everything into categories that are as detailed as you need them. Want a generic location? Ok, that works. Want a location with a profile pic, map, parent location, associated relations and calendars, notes, and more? Ok, that works too. Organizations, families, quests, items; these are some more examples of categories each with their own details and options.
* Everything is interconnected with tags if you choose to use them. Visited a town two years ago that you can't remember much about? That's cool, just select the town's tag and you'll see everything in a nice little list. Even better? You can nest tags within tags, so looking up the town's region will also show the town's stuff.
* You can assign different roles to users. Want to set it up so players are able to edit the item lists but not see stuff you've marked private (like the note stating which NPC is the actual BBEG)? Done, in like 20 seconds. You can make the game public too, so users can view the stuff without logging in as long as they have the link (good for paranoid players using public computers).
* Speaking of paranoia, you can export pretty much everything as a PDF so you've got a backup of your hard work saved in case something apocalyptic happens that's strong enough to kill the Internet but not strong enough to snuff your desire for raiding Lich King tombs.
* It's FREE. As in no purchase price, no monthly subscription, and no ads. There is a Patreon that unlocks larger image uploads for $1 a month, but that's not required since you can still upload smaller images with a 2mb max file size.

&#x200B;

I'm a music composer and DM. I always struggled to find high quality ambiences, so I decided to create my own and make them available for free for everyone on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MichaelGhelfi?sub_confirmation=1) (we are 12'500). I strongly believe we need more than just words to create the most immersive experience for our dear players. Some of us use miniatures, some have cosplays. Me, I use sounds :)

You can find them here : [Ambiences Playlist (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbHUA-o_5dgJbOXwtdVx--gTnmWfiyyys)

&#x200B;

**What to expect :**

* Masterfully mixed and mastered
* Professional quality sounds
* Standardized volume (the more I could) so you don't have to play the DJ while you DM
* **Three** new ambiences per week (Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays). You can even vote for what you want to see next in the ""community"" tab of my channel.
* One of the most active YouTube community in this sector. Hundreds of people are voting for the next ambiences, sharing their opinion, proposing new ambiences, and shaping the channel they want for the soon-to-be biggest ambiences library on YouTube (see the community tab)
* Immersive texts written by the community under the videos to boost your creativity (that's a very recent project but we created a Discord server with 20+ writers and we create stories to go with the ambiences :))
* Completely free on my YouTube channel
* If you are a streamer, podcaster or if you make YouTube videos, you can freely monetize your content using my ambiences. I just ask for a link to my YouTube channel. For other inquiries, contact me.

&#x200B;

Feel free to make suggestions if you don't find what you need. I'll add your proposition to my TODO list if it's doable and useful for all.

&#x200B;

If you prefer to download the ambiences, you can get them [here](https://michaelghelfi.bandcamp.com/), but there's no premium content if you pay since I don't want richer people to have any advantage or bonus.

&#x200B;

I hope that will be useful :)

twxwqw,WotC has an incredible opportunity right now to do a last-hurrah re-release of 4th edition.,"**The lead, lest I not bury it:** Compile and re-release 4th edition Essentials, errata, and fixes from books like DMG2 and MM3 as one big book, ""D&D Tactics"". Make it clear that it is 4e compatible, usable with 4e campaign setting books, and is targeted at people who want crunchier mechanics and combat than 5e.

# Why

D&D 4e was an extremely cool product that stumbled out of the gate. It was D&D with tactical skirmish wargame combat, and could have been a hit. WotC made two fatal mistakes with its release:

1. They did not make it clear exactly what it was. Players expected a loose system, instead they got a tight one. WotC did not control the branding or message, so players took over. The narrative became that it was an MMO in tabletop form.
2. It was not well-balanced in the core rulebook. Combats were a slog and new additions like skill challenges made little sense as written. Items were plentiful and weak. It didn't quite land as was intended by the designers.

These were corrected quite a bit late in the game. Essentials released as somewhat of a ""4.5e"" errata and rebalancing, alongside lots of ""2"" and ""3"" core rulebooks, all too late and split between too many products.

Only now, many years later, D&D players who have dipped their toes in wargaming have finally come to realize what the designers at WotC were intending. Especially now that 5e is so light on crunch that alternative RPG systems are experiencing a renaissance from tabletop diehards, even as 5e reaches its mainstream peak.

The disadvantage to this late-blooming realization is that players who wish to pursue 4e inevitably encounter the fact that they need several extra books to play 4e ""the way it was meant to be played"". A stack of 6 books on the table isn't an appealing prospect.

# How

Compile everything that might be considered ""4.5e"" together. The core classes, a few of the best alternate classes from PHB2/3, cleaned up mechanics, balanced monsters, and the highest-quality alternate rules and tweaks such as DMG2/Dark Sun ""Fixed Enhancement Bonus"".

Release it all as a single book. Alternative systems are well-known for publishing PC creation, DM rules, and enemy lists into a single hardcover book. This is a great opportunity for WotC to give this a try with D&D.

They must make it *very clear* what this product is. Call it ""D&D Tactics"" because it's D&D with tactical combat and balanced class kits. Also make it clear that it is fully 4e compatible, and players can pull out their old campaign setting books. The ""Tactics"" label also makes it clear that it is a ""spin-off"" product that does not take attention away from 5e product lines, and does not need to be considered by 5e players. But it *must* be made clear that it is *not* 5e-compatible. This probably means using the 4e D&D logo and the 4e art and cover styling, so there's no confusion. Stay away from 5e cover styling.

---

And yeah, that's all. I want to see 4e given a fair shake. It was a cool system, I want to play it again without a stack of errata on the table, so it needs some love. A lot of people are waking up to the fact that it was top notch when pursued correctly.

9oi757,"I DM'd a game where combat was 100% arena based, and it was liberating.","As a DM, I have always had trouble with getting combat 'right.' I seem to alternate between combats that are too easy and a bit boring, or murderous near TPK's with no in-between. 

Recently i started a game that completely switched the emphasis. Instead of adventuring around normally, the players were part of a mercenary group who slay monsters in an arena for entertainment (I got the idea from a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35052265-bloody-rose)).

Suddenly, It didn't matter in the slightest if the combat was too easy. Sure the players could go slaughter a bunch of goblins without breaking a sweat, but that isn't going to get the crowd going. When the 'point' of combat shifted away from loot-nabbing and survival and into entertaining a crowd,  players started thinking of cool ways to approach the battle and interesting combinatorial use of spells and abilities. They did all the things I'd been trying to encourage them to do since *forever* without the slightest prompting. 

And I felt a lot of pressure to get combat 'right' lift from me as a DM -- it didn't matter if things were a bit easy because the players still had to impress the crowd, and everyone had a lot of fun figuring out cool/awesome ways to do that, and i found myself having a lot more fun with it too. 

Obviously this approach doesn't work for all campaigns/scenarios, but I'd highly recommend throwing some arena combat against your players. Just make sure the condition for victory isn't necessarily just winning the fight, but impressing judges. In my tournament, several teams take turns fighting monsters and are given a score based on how well they do, with bonus points for flashiness. 

On their own, players decided they wanted to try sabotage the other teams by drugging the monsters they were going to fight so they couldn't fight back. It's hard to give a flashy performance when the ogre is asleep. 

It's been a really fun, if weird, campaign so far and I just wanted to bring it up -- because hey, you might have some fun with it, too and it's been a good antidote to something I've always struggled with as a DM - getting combat *just so*.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2aced0200>,rpg,1539647146.0

jxb4xb,You don't need to stay in a game that isn't fun.,"Hi all, a few years ago I played in a game that was probably one of the worst I ever joined. It made me remember a really important lesson as a player.

You don't need to stay in a game that isn't fun. If you tried to advocate for yourself and nothing is changing it may be time to leave.

You don’t need to do that. If you’re playing in a game with other players or a GM that are stopping you from having fun there is no reason to stay. You know what is fun for you.

Fear is a big reason a lot of players stay with games that aren’t fun anymore. They may be afraid they’ll hurt someone’s feelings if they leave. Or they may be afraid they won’t find another game. 

That makes sense. If you find a game after looking for a long time it can be a tough thing to walk away. RPGs scratch a lot of itches for people, and it can be scary to leave a group if you don’t know who your next GM will be. 

I've chosen to return to a bad game before because I had that fear. I didn’t think I’d be able to find another game.

After playing for most of my life I can tell you this with certainty. The next game will happen. You may need to wait a little while, and you may need to meet some new people, but if you look you’ll be able to find it.

Its hard to put into words the massive influence David was having on the Brit roleplaying scene, and indeed on pretty much everyone priveleged to collide with one of David's many worlds. I'm in no doubt that had he managed to hold the line for a few more years his name would have become synonymous with Call of Cthulhu with the international scene as it already was for us.

Depression is the modern plague, stripping its victims of themselves and denying the rest of us the uniqueness that every victim so often has and desperately wants to offer. Nobody makes charity runs for victims of depression. There is no empathy ribbon.

yrc10f,The case for playing with yourself,"No, I haven't got the wrong subreddit :)

Now is the best time to get into solo roleplaying. There's been a huge surge in new games and resources for playing on your own, and there are thriving communities dedicated to sharing knowledge and experiences.

**Consider this an open invitation to the world of solo** (and a brief induction).

*Full disclosure: I am a designer who specialises in solo but I will promoting exactly zero of my games and resources in this post.*

So you've stepped into the club, but you're hovering awkwardly near the entrance. Let's run down some things.

**1. Why solo?**

If you answer yes to any of these, then solo could be for you:

* do you want to create a world or story that's completely, uniquely yours?
* do you want to scratch that adventuring itch at a time and pace that suits you?
* do you want to feel that childlike sense of wonder you used to get when you'd make up tales by yourself with your toys, delighting in letting your imagination run free?
* do you want to improve your storytelling?
* do you want a restful, introspective activity to fill your time?
* do you want to embark on a journey without knowing where it will take you?
* do you want inspiration for your big group campaign?
* do you want to get use out of the games in your collection you can never normally get to the table?

**2. But I like playing with my friends**

There's something singularly special about spending time with other people, carving out a shared story and experience. Solo play is not a like-for-like replacement, it is its own thing. Crucially the two ways of playing are not mutually exclusive. You can enjoy both.

**3. Where would I start?**

Now there's a question! Let me walk you over to the club's recommendation board...

Games that are often peoples' first solo experience:

* [**Thousand Year Old Vampire**](https://thousandyearoldvampire.com/) \- a simple, intuitive, beautiful game about chronicling the many centuries of a vampire's existence (this [illustrated playthrough on twitter](https://twitter.com/olddoggames/status/1377786943962902529) will make you want to play)
* [**Ironsworn**](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/) \- a robust, quest-driven FREE game about undertaking perilous quests in a dark fantasy setting (the [Me, Myself and Die series on YouTube with Trevor Devall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVxJ3exjfgI) perfectly captures the agony and ecstasy of playing solo)
* [**Four Against Darkness**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/180588/Four-Against-Darkness) \- a dungeon-delving, dice-chucking procedural game that straddles the line between board game and roleplaying game

Games that are slightly off the beaten track:

* [**The Machine**](https://adira.itch.io/the-machine) \- a serial, journalling game about a cursed machine, involving filling out a notebook and passing it on to the next player
* [**Alone Among The Stars**](https://noroadhome.itch.io/alone-among-the-stars) \- a simple game about exploring space and experiencing wondrous sights
* [**The Wretched**](https://loottheroom.itch.io/wretched) \- a sci-fi horror journalling game about being the sole remaining crew member on a salvage ship, trying to survive. Cleverly makes use of a Jenga tower to represent the ship's ailing structural integrity
* [**The Portal at Hill House**](https://presspotgames.itch.io/the-portal-at-hill-house) \- a cosmic horror game using dice and playing cards about navigating a cursed house

*There are so many to mention, so I will add a separate comment below with some others!*

The non-solo games that you already know and love:

* **Call of Cthulhu** \- Chaosium publish a series of solo gamebooks for CoC, e.g. the introductory solitaire adventure [**Alone Against the Flames**](https://www.chaosium.com/alone-against-the-flames/)
* **Mörk Borg** \- [**Sölitary Defilement**](https://1d105.itch.io/solitary-defilement) is a supplement for the main game that introduces ""comprehensive rules for exploring the dying lands solitary""
* **Mausritter** \- [**Einzelmaus**](https://manarampmatt.itch.io/einzelmaus-solo-mausritter) is another solo tool you can bolt onto the core game to allow solo play
* **DnD** \- believe it or not you can play DnD single-player using a variety of tools. One of the most commonly used is called the [**Mythic Games Master Emulator (Mythic GME)**](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/20798/Mythic-Game-Master-Emulator). This a universal tool that helps replace the traditional GM role. Which brings me onto...

**4. What are things I should know?**

Some games are made for solo, some games are made for group but can be adapted for solo. In the latter case, often you can get by with what's called an *oracle*.

It's easy enough to answer yes/no questions with dice rolls or coin flips, but when you have an open question, like ""what do I see in this room?"", that's where an oracle comes in. Essentially it's a random table that will steer you in an unexpected, but not entirely untenable direction. Mythic GME, which I mentioned above, is just one example of a comprehensive tool along these lines (others are available). Using something like this, suddenly a lot of the games on your shelf are opened up to solo play.

r/Solo_Roleplaying is a friendly community that can help you out with suggestions or if you're stuck. In their About section there are a load of great resources for getting started.

Let me take this moment to formally welcome you to the club. **If you have questions about playing solo, leave a comment** and hopefully the more experienced soloers can give you a hand.

**If you're already part of the solo club, leave a comment and tell us about your favourite experience playing solitaire.**",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ad0d6690>,rpg,1668079536.0

1d8325h,Learning RPGs really isn’t that hard,"I know I’m preaching to the choir here, but whenever I look at other communities I always see this sentiment “Modifying D&D is easier than learning a new game,” but like that’s bullshit?? Games like Blades in the Dark, Powered by the Apocalypse, Dungeon World, ect. Are designed to be easy to learn and fun to play. Modifying D&D to be like those games is a monumental effort when you can learn them in like 30 mins. I was genuinely confused when I learned BitD cause it was so easy, I actually thought “wait that’s it?” Cause PF and D&D had ruined my brain. 

It’s even worse for other crunch games, turning D&D into PF is way harder than learning PF, trust me I’ve done both. I’m floored by the idea that someone could turn D&D into a mecha game and that it would be easier than learning Lancer or even fucking Cthulhu tech for that matter (and Cthulhu tech is a fucking hard system). The worse example is Shadowrun, which is so steeped in nonsense mechanics that even trying to motion at the setting without them is like an entirely different game.

I’m fine with people doing what they love, and I think 5e is a good base to build stuff off of, I do it. But by no means is it easier, or more enjoyable than learning a new game. Learning games is fun and helps you as a designer grow. If you’re scared of other systems, don’t just lie and say it’s easier to bend D&D into a pretzel, cause it’s not.

1czm1a2,Unpopular Opinion: ANY Miniature Will Work,"I work part-time at my FLGS and I (Me) had a very usual interaction with a customer (C) the other night.

C: Do you have any other centaur miniatures? The Nolzur's one is too buff.

Me: {thinking she was going for a dad-bod centaur, fantastic idea, be different!} Let me see what else we have in the system... okay, the only other centaurs we have are for the Kings of War games by Mantic. {walk her over to wargames aisle} Here... and here.

C: Oh, they have horns, my character doesn't have horns. {proceeds to do the thing every FLGS employee dreads, tell me about her character's 15 page backstory}

Me: {nodding and smiling while the elevator Muzak plays between my ears} Okay, that sounds interesting! But I'm sorry, these are what we have. 

C: {thinking it will help} Here, I built him in Hero Forge, this is what he looks like. {proceeds to show me fairly generic centaur fighter character, that looks just as buff as the Nolzur's one we have on a peg, no dad-bod to be seen}

Brief interlude, because my brain is screaming at this point - even if you don't have your own 3d printer, you can create a character to your specifications in Hero Forge and pay them to print it for you. Even if you can't afford the $20 for the cheapest, unpainted, ""not premium"" plastic, for a mere $13, they'll make you a colored plastic standee that looks pretty good and is easier to store and transport. 

Me: You know they will print those for you and sell them to you, right?

C: Oh yeah, but that's too expensive.

Me: {more grinning and nodding and gritting of teeth}

Look folks, we all want to put a miniature out onto the table that looks EXACTLY like how we picture our PCs look like in our heads, but it's not going to happen. Unless you go to the trouble of rebuilding them in Hero Forge every time they have a change of gear and pay for the expense of reprinting them, which most of us can't afford or be bothered to do. Which now begs the question of what you're doing with the old mini when you've replaced it, but that's a different conversation. So what miniature will work for us? The miniature that you can afford, whether it's a generic Nolzur's/Bones/Deep Cuts plastic, or a wargame metal/resin, or a plastic standee, or even a paper tent mini you've downloaded from the internet and printed on your employer's color printer when no one was looking, as long as you can recognize it from across the table and differentiate it from all the other miniatures on the table. That's it. This isn't tournament level WH40K where everything has to be WYSIWYG, close enough is all we're looking for. And if you can't afford the string of self or professionally printed Hero Forge or similar minis, ""good enough"" will just have to work for you.

Sorry folks, rant over. What are your experiences with miniatures at the table? And yes, I struggle with this in games other than D&D, any system that allows use of miniatures has seen this issue come up at one time or another.

10rztmf,"The OSR, Lonely Fun, and why I believe many D&D alternatives entirely miss the point of why people will never leave 5th Edition","After \~recent events\~ it's an exciting time to evangelize new games for your table, especially if you want to get your D&D 5e group to try out some great new stuff. But looking at some of the discourse, I think when we talk about what makes certain TTRPGs appealing, we need to have a more sober look at why many of our friends, loved ones, and favorite fellow D&D addicts play the game.

For many, maybe even *most* D&D players, one of the essential, load-bearing pillars of the hobby to them has nothing to do with how the game plays, but rather, the **Lonely Fun**.

# Lonely Fun

The Lonely Fun is all of the stuff you do as a part of your hobby away from the table, in any way you might engage. For D&D 5e players, this is usually building complicated and elaborate characters on the page, pouring over the books for new races and subclasses, figuring out fun new combinations, and carefully crafting characters. It's also watching the livestreams and YouTube, shopping for accessories that will match a particular character, checking in on hobby news sources in order to anticipate upcoming releases. When WotC/Hasbro says it wants D&D to be a ""lifestyle brand"" it is exactly this pre-existing behavior that they are talking about -- they get made fun of for this, but they are really just observing something that is already happening. (It's worth noting that the recent D&D renaissance was sparked by a livestream that doesn't just get you interested in playing but, possibly more vitally, gives you hundreds and hundreds of hours of content to watch.)

Many of the things that are described as ""problems"" of D&D, like its lack of balance, its arcane subsystems, the things it attempts to simulate or not, actually *support* Lonely Fun the same way that video game metas support e-sports. Ever-changing balances around character builds, power creep in new releases -- these things are ***toyetic***. They give you something to play with in your free time when you wanna get away from work or school. They give you something to chat with other players about.

Yes, of course these players like playing at the table, but a huge part of the play experience is that it's an opportunity to try out all of the stuff they imagine and think about all week. The social experience *justifies and supports* the Lonely Fun. We can imagine that many people who didn't have an actual game group could still engage with D&D regularly -- this basically *was* the business model for 3rd Edition, and the reason that every 3rd party product needs to be chock full of player options even when it doesn't make any initial sense.

# Solutions for GMs that just create vacuums for players

Though most people might nod their heads at everything before, I think this is tough to *deeply* sympathize for forever DMs and GMs, and those of us who build worlds and run games, because when it comes to D&D alternatives and OSR games, *our* Lonely Fun remains untouched. If I want to run Mausritter, I could still spend my week paging through 3rd party supplements, randomly generating my hexes, preparing my sessions, and chatting with other DMs about it. But if my players switched over from Mausritter, a game where you can generate a full character in literally two minutes, what are they going to do between sessions? Re-watch The Secret of NIMH every week? I'm running more Call of Cthulhu each week, and even there we have similar issues.

For this reason, other RPGs, and particularly OSR games, are incredibly ill-suited to hobbyist players. Even D&D's biggest competitors have vastly fewer Lonely Fun opportunities.

All of this is key to keep in mind when debates rage about why people can't get players to stick, and the odd conspiracy theories about what happens in the industry or in the community in order to lock people into 5e. So many people advertise elegant rules sets, better tools for smoother sessions, simpler character creation, and better at-the-table play experiences, but these are often things that solve problems for GMs, not players. For *players*, overhearing them complaining about certain imbalances is akin to a sports fan complaining about their favorite players getting drafted to another team, because the opportunity to gab on a barstool and demonstrate niche knowledge is *why* they're a sports fan. \[EDIT: in other words, the complaint isn't a bug that needs solving, it is the fun that they're there for, it's the point.\]

But there's a better analogy here to work with...

# Wargaming has the same ""problem""

To use an analogy, there's a parallel problem in tabletop wargaming hobby, where the dominant player is Games Workshop and Warhammer 40,000, specifically, a game with punishingly expensive models and rulebooks, a draconian ruleset with a meta focused on monotonous competitive play, lore so arcane you could never hope to learn it all, and a community with a persistent Nazi incel problem. It's a money pit and a time sink so profound that many of you are probably having PTSD flashbacks just being reminded of your times painting or playing.

And for decades, there's been a vanguard of wargamers saying ""Stop giving them your money! There are better games with cheaper models, even minis-agnostic games! Play Frostgrave, it's so fun! Play OnePageRules! Why won't you all exit the vampire's castle of Games Workshop!? Wake up sheeple!!!"" But what they fail to realize is that for many, the above problems or bugs in the Warhammer 40,000 hobby are its *actual* biggest features. For a certain kind of person (let's say, for example, an escapist who is also a problem spender), the fact that it's a hobby that will eat all of your spare time, attention, and money is *exactly what they like about it*. In the same way that certain former drug addicts describe scoring dope each day as being a daily mission that gave them an immediate sense of urgency or purpose, the 40K hobbyist checks for the new limited-release Warbands and command boxes filled with plastic crack from Games Workshop, new YouTube meta videos and battle reports, the latest 4-hour lore video to put on in the background while painting. To make cheap models and simple rules is to *take the core experience out of the hobby*.

((Before I close here, I have to say to you, the guy about to comment ""Well that's not what MY players are like,"" that no, I do not believe this applies to every single player or table. In fact, the more likely your players are beer&pretzels types who think of TTRPGs only while they're at the table, and identify with it less as a hobby and more as just what-they-do-when-they-hang-out, the more foreign the Lonely Fun aspects will seem to them.))

Evangelizing certain TTRPGs requires this kind of recognition about D&D players. Many of them -- maybe a VAST swathe -- don't want a procedurally generated world, they don't want ""player skill,"" they have no interest in a character generation process that takes place at the table. They don't want a game where the ""answer is not on your character sheet,"" because the character sheet is the *primary item of interest* for their experience. The Lonely Fun is the point.

***tl;dr:*** It is possible that the TTRPG you want your players to get into might be much better for you as a GM, and might even lead to better sessions, but would ruin all of the fun that your D&D players are having *away* from the table out of your sight, and therefore will never meet their hobby-ing needs.

\[EDIT\] I want to clarify, I don't think this is ***the*** reason that D&D is so ubiquitous, or why it's The Big Game, but particularly why a certain type of player who is drawn to D&D 5e won't be drawn to other types of games, or at least why other types of games won't stick to them. I only add this because there are ppl in the comments going ""No, the reason D&D 5e is so popular is actually one reason, and it's very simple, and it's \[...\]"" but I'm not sure it's really constructive.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ad564320>,rpg,1675369429.0

___
Hi! Where to begin? 

For those of you unfamiliar with Hunter x Hunter's Greed Island, it's an mmo-like world that famous mangaka (HxH's author) Yoshihiro Togashi created for one of the serie's arcs, but what sets it apart is what I consider to be the highly novel card system he designed at its core, a system connected to every aspect of the game's world and inhabitants in a clever and satisfying way.

Part of what makes is special is that it's set up to allow for some really creative uses when it comes to its features— pretty much encouraging it by its very nature— and these features always have something valuable to contribute to every single one of the primary aspects of role playing games. And what's more is that it actually does this without it being an overly complex system at a surface level, which means it can be picked up with relative ease (in fact, slowly learning ""the system"" and to what extent it can be taken advantage of to achieve one's goals is an intended part of the in-game experience itself, something the PCs and potential rivals alike all have to go through).

But to be honest, I wouldn't be able to capture its true charm and mechanical novelty here with just a few words, so instead I urge you to just take a look at the PDF yourselves; check out the card system's mechanics, and especially the cards themselves— their artwork, their properties, to what extent can the players find unexpected things to do with them, etc.

As for the PDF itself, it gives you all the rules, details, and resources needed to run the game, and functions as a guide to craft your very own version of Greed Island for the type of setting you want to host or might already be hosting, so that it fits within the scope, lore, and aesthetics of the campaign. I made sure to add hyperlinks that take you to the different sections mentioned throughout it, so you can access each one pretty conveniently too.
Aside from the PDF, I also made tons of generators and charts to assist the GM in preparing the sort of content that is unique to a game like Greed Island, helping especially with the improv side of things. Ah, and I do intend to continue adding to those as I generate content for my very own Greed Island campaigns. All of that will always be accessible in the subreddit's wiki, along with the PDF and the character sheets.

So, those of you who are already familiar with Greed Island and have always wanted to experience it, your chance is finally here. And for those of you exploring it for the first time, I hope you come to enjoy the unique things it offers.

1g3ozcb,Does anyone else feel like rules-lite systems aren't actually easier. they just shift much more of the work onto the GM,"This is a thought I recently had when I jumped in for a friend as a GM for one of his games. It was a custom setting using fate accelerated as the system. 

I feel like keeping lore and rules straight is one thing. I only play with nice people who help me out when I make mistakes. However there is always a certain expectation on the GM to keep things fair. Things should be fun and creative, but shouldn't go completely off the rails. That's why there are rules. Having a rule for jumping and falling for example cuts down a lot of the work when having to decide if a character can jump over a chasm or plummet to their death. Ideally the players should have done their homework and know what their character is capable of and if they want to do something they should know the rules for that action.

Now even with my favorite systems there are moments when you have to make judgment calls as the GM. You have to decide if it is fun for the table if they can tunnel through the dungeon walls and circumvent your puzzles and encounters or not.

But, and I realize this might be a pretty unpopular opinion, I think in a lot of rules-lite systems just completely shift the responsibility of keeping the game fun in that sense onto the GM. Does this attack kill the enemies? Up to the GM. Does this PC die? Up to the GM. Does the party fail or succeed? Completely at the whims of the GM. 

And at first this kind of sounds like this is less work for both the players and the Gm both, because no one has to remember or look up any rules, but I feel like it kinda just piles more responsibility and work onto the GM. It kinda forces you into the role of fun police more often than not. And if you just let whatever happen then you inevitably end up in a situation where you have to improv everything. 

And like some improv is great. That’s what keeps roleplaying fun, but pulling fun encounters, characters and a plot out of your hat, that is only fun for so long and inevitably it ends up kinda exhausting.

I often hear that rules lite systems are more collaborative when it comes to storytelling, but so far both as the player and the GM I feel like this is less of the case. Sure the players have technically more input, but… If I have to describe it it just feels like the input is less filtered so there is more work on the GM to make something coherent out of it. When there are more rules it feels like the workload is divided more fairly across the table.

Do you understand what I mean, or do you have a different take on this? With how popular rules lite systems are on this sub, I kinda feel like I do something wrong with my groups. What do you think?

  
EDIT: Just to clarify I don't hate on rules-lite systems. I actually find many of them pretty great and creative. I'm just saying that they shift more of the workload onto the GM instead of spreading it out more evenly amonst the players.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ad7b0890>,rpg,1728935478.0

ijxauc,Try my free solo worldbuilding RPG,"Hi  all - hope this is ok to post! A few weeks back I shared an early  prototype for a worldbuilding game/tool I was working on called Foundations. Based on the feedback I received I've made a few changes - and have opened up the current work-in-progress to anyone who's interested.

Foundations is a solo worldbuilding game where players create the long history of a fantasy world. All you need is a standard deck of cards and some pens and paper. I'm pretty happy with the results and have got some really good feedback already. 

If you wanna try the current version yourself please check it out below. There's also links there on how you can leave feedback and other things.

1sj29d,"Sorry, I need to gush","So my co-worker and I were chatting about a month ago, turns out she and her four closest friends have been looking to get their D&D on for some time. Funny enough, I've been looking to DM again for even longer. I used to, many years ago, but I had big problems with my players getting 'bored' with their characters (ie: they saw the mage get a cool magic item, so they wanted to play a mage. And on...).

So I roll in that Sunday with my books in hand and they were kind enough to have character sheets and dice. Only problem is, just one of them has ever played D&D. One dude has never played an RPG before! I quickly steer that fellow away from the idea of playing a Druid or a Sorcerer (complex classes with a lot of restrictions and little short-term pay-off. Let's be honest, it's true), so I suggested fighter. Of course, he wanted to be a Dwarf. Excellent! He seemed a bit grumbly at the idea of being 'the tank' (oh how much they have to learn...), but I assured him he would have fun.

The rest of the group rolled up and seemed pretty happy with their characters. Human bard, elf ranger, dwarf wizard (who grew up with the fighter, parentless, in a 'dwarfanage'), and human cleric of St. Cuthbert. HORRAY! I managed to get a balanced party without people pulling knives on one another. I was almost salivating, ready to play.

First adventure they investigate a town where some kids have gone missing. Along they way they get attacked by a praying mantis the size of a draft horse. The dwarf fighter swoops in, saves the day, and takes it's head off like it was in mating season with a natural 20. Suddenly, the player is a lot less grumbly, he is over-the-top thrilled with his character. The party succeeds in killing goblins, an ettercap, and rescuing some of the villagers. They receive a few rewards, but the town is poor so they just promise to offer them cheap weapon and armor repair whenever they come to visit. Pays off in my world, as it's basically dark-age technology prices on everything (dwarves are in a state of isolationism, so no fancy metals!). They seem really enthusiastic about this, and feel quite attached to the tiny hamlet they helped save. Oh, be still my DM heart!

They go back to town, get another job. Turns out the local mages have had some books go missing from their library. They investigate, go down into the catacombs, and find a bugbear prowling around at night! But it's wearing robes and seems to be wearing cobbled together glasses... So instead of killing it, they knock it out, tie it up, and decide to question it. In quite a posh, scholarly tone, the bugbear explains how cross it is with the party! Turns out he is a previous chief librarian who was cursed, and just continues his research on the mating habits of Carrion Crawlers when nobody is around to bother him. Missing books? Why he's always returned the books he borrowed before morning. Uh oh, turns out the head librarian set this whole thing up to try and get the bugbear killed and get access to the Black Archive of the library (the bugbear had a key). Epic battle in the Black Archive follows, with the bugbear nearly killed by a summoned dire ape of fiendish quality. The party flips their shit. They really liked Bartholomew! No way he was gonna die on their watch. The cleric burns healing spells, taking some heavy hits for his trouble, but saves my NPC. The ranger manages to not be stunned by a spell and takes the no-good, villainous librarian in the eye with an arrow before he teleports away.

The emotional attachment my players are exhibiting to the world, their characters, AND the NPCs around them is like a breath of fresh air. They really care about the game, and the little rewards for them are just as good as the occasional magic item that falls into their hands. I have so many wonderful, horrible stories in mind for them as they level up. What makes it even more of an honour for me is that this is, for some of them, their first ever game of table top. I'm so proud of this group, and I can't wait to see what stories we tell together next.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2af2c8530>,rpg,1386655161.0
1hfhfwb,"Why did the ""mainstreamification"" of RPGs take such a different turn than it did for board games?","Designer board games have enjoyed an meteoric rise in popularity in basically the same time frame as TTRPGs but the way its manifested is so different.

Your average casual board gamer is unlikely to own a copy of Root or Terraforming Mars. Hell they might not even know those games exist, but you can safely bet that they:

1. Have a handful of games they've played and enjoyed multiple times

2. Have an understanding that different genres of games are better suited for certain players

3. Will be willing to give a new, potentially complicated board game a shot even if they know they might not love it in the end.

4. Are actually aware that other board games exist

Yet on the other side of the ""nerds sit around a table with snacks"" hobby none of these things seem to be true for the average D&D 5e player. Why?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2af3b7e60>,rpg,1734350003.0

&#x200B;

I love your dedication to the game. I love your roleplay. I love that you put up with me for years, and that you try out new ideas.

I love that you keep your inner murderhobo in check and do not attempt to derail the campaign given the slightest possibility. I love that you do not go psycho (at least, completely psycho). I love that you use some clever solutions.

I love that you play the game in earnest and don't troll all your way through.

I love that you rarely argue with my judgements, because that also means that when you argue, I likely did something wrong.

But, gods dammit, players! How the hell do you not know basic mechanics after a year of weekly playing? Why do I must explain to you every turn that you can't do certain actions? Why am I always the one to blame if you forgot some rule and it bites you? Why do you need about five minutes to decide what to do?

There must be some way for you. I know that as gamemaster I read much more of the rules, but can't you even read what you can and what you can't do in a round? What skills and abilities regulate? How and in which circumstances your powers apply?

And why do I need to constantly remind you of what you did? Make some notes, people.

I love you, guys, but read the f---g rules.

We know more about RPGs than creating videos, but we're working very hard on this!","Without giving away too much personal information -- over the years my co-host, Conrad, found that the world of tabletop RPG gaming can be very therapeutic to those who may need it. In some not-so-great times it's uplifted not only himself, but he's personally seen it uplift others as well. 

To give back to the community, we are developing a channel to show just how social, therapeutic and rewarding this type of gaming can be! 

He's the Veteran GM and I'm the novice adventurer that the audience will learn through. 

For each game we cover we'll introduce an abridged version of the rules and how to create a character, actual gameplay with our rotating cast of fellow degenerates, and provide each player's individual feedback about the system. What their favorite parts of the game were down to what was the most challenging. 

We've been planning this for over a year now and the show has constantly evolved as we have gotten closer to this point in time. We'd love to hear your comments on what you may like to see in a channel devoted to teaching our favorite past time to those who are itching to learn. Help us mold the show into the best it can be!

Any feedback, questions or comments are more than welcome! We have improved our audio setup after not being overly happy with the audio quality of the teaser and will be tweaking our chromakey setup so everything looks as crisp as we can make it. We're doing the best we can to put on a professional quality show with what we have at our disposal (and what our wives will let us spend on equipment, haha).

Thanks for your time, and we look forward to gaming with you in 2020!

gp4yzl,Ever Wanted A Fully Functioning Village? I Made One For You.," Hey Guys,

Here is a handy campaign setting handout I made for my players, based around a Yorkshire Estate set in 800AD. However, this could easily be transferred into any fantasy setting.

[https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M7rRi-g8xLilmQNvHEH](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M7rRi-g8xLilmQNvHEH)

It was made for a RuneQuest campaign that I've been GMing for the last year and a half, and as such had an awful amount of stats and figures piling up that no one really wanted to interact with. As an example - ( 📷[https://gyazo.com/fa1ee998c8c56a439182bf1978d11ce8](https://gyazo.com/fa1ee998c8c56a439182bf1978d11ce8) ) - although this is the result of a couple of hours clean up. So I figured I needed to engage the players in the stake that they have, especially with about 6 months/ 1 year in game downtime approaching.

**Within the handout you can find:**

\- A brief history of the Estate.

\- An easy to understand description of the ruling system.

\- A layout of the key buildings both within the Manor and on the Outlying Hides (1 Hide = 120 Acres), and the nearby bandit village that has entered the service of the party (the Ealdormen).

\- A breakdown of the local economy (Income Vs Expenditure).

\- A breakdown of how the monetary system works (Pounds/Shillings/Pence) and some modern day equivalents.

I hope you all enjoy, and if you have any questions please ask away!

gft9oj,"I made an app for rolling symbol-based dice, and you can use your own symbols.","I made an app to create & roll symbol-based dice and I'm looking for feedback. If a game doesn't have enough dice, you lost some, or just prefer rolling on your phone then you may find this useful!

You can make dice with any number of sides, colour them and set values/symbols per side from a built-in library or import your own. When you roll dice, results are totalled at the bottom for convenience and you can fudge or explode dice as needed. Dice are grouped into bags so they can be organised per game and shared with friends, and it's been tested to ensure true randomness.

I hope you find it useful. The aim has been to keep things simple and easy to use, but you should be able to make any dice you need from your collection or your imagination. Had some great feedback last time I posted this with many of those requests now in the app, so let me know what you think.

egdfzs,Why it pays to be picky about the people you play with,"Video where I discuss the topic title [here.](https://youtu.be/D0bsVdWDFcg)

If you're like me, you enjoy RPG Horror Stories as a bit of a guilty pleasure. I'm an avid reader of /r/rpghorrorstories and have a few of my own. It's almost a rite of passage to have your sneak attack taken away by a neophyte GM who thinks they know more than the entire design team at Wizards, or to play with a player who conveniently forgot to tell the party that their pet dire wolf is somehow a multiclassed barbarian artificer. 

As much as I love these stories, there's something I see in a lot of these accounts that upsets me. The OP, after describing absolutely horrifying RPG sessions, then explains that they continued to play for another 5 or 10 sessions before quitting, or even worse, that they are *still playing* in the offending campaign. 

The above is a symptom of something I've noticed across our hobby: people playing with other people they don't especially like, or with people who actively disrespect them or their boundaries. For some reason, RPG fans are way too tolerant of jerks. Sometimes I'll hear a person describe the game they are playing in a tone dripping with either exasperation or derision, and I'll wonder: ""If you're so miserable, why the hell are you still playing?""

Roleplaying games are not like basketball. Let me explain: roleplaying games are experiences where one's personality is central to the experience (unless you're playing a game that is almost more board-game than traditional RPG). If someone is mean-spirited, condescending, or interesting in explored messed up impulses without consulting the boundaries of others -- that stuff *comes out in game* in a way that wouldn't be possible in other games like basketball. If I play a pick-up game with a jerk, yes, they can be a jerk in the game, but for the most part the mechanics of basketball (or most sports) don't give that person conduits to express that without violating the rules of the game. You can play with hundreds of strangers and get away with having mostly good times.

This is why folks should be incredibly picky with who they play games with or run games for. I'm not saying you shouldn't play with new folks -- in fact you can use RPGs to make new friends, it's an awesome hobby for that. But the operative idea is that you should be playing with friends or folks you would like to be friends with. If you're in a game with people you wouldn't like associating with in any other context, **that's a massive red flag.** Get out of there!

What do you guys think?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2af5ea540>,rpg,1577465236.0
