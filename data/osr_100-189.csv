The Hole in the Oak: 7 deaths in 7 hours (play report),"Today I ran [The Hole in the Oak](https://necroticgnome.com/products/the-hole-in-the-oak) with 4 level 1 players. In 7 hours, there were 7 deaths. Yet they weren't totally inexperienced. I'd already played them a dozen OSE sessions, with perhaps 6 deaths, but I guess they weren't ready to tackle such a dangerous dungeon.

*(Spoiler alert do not read on if you intend to play the module)*

After visiting several very quiet rooms and killing a crab spider, they met the mutant ogre. After initiating dialogue, the orgre began to get angry and threatened to devour the group's elf. When the elf tried to flee, a fight broke out, which obviously went very badly (it's a 6+1\*HD creature). Two players made the mistake of fleeing to an undiscovered location. They came face to face with the 3 troglodytes who slaughtered them. The other two lured the ogre to the teleporter, who found himself transported to the bat cave.

**2 deaths**

Later, they discovered the bronze idol. Rushing to steal the chalice, they were attacked by 7 baby trees and, instead of fleeing, tried to hold on. That was really suicidal : they killed 7 of the 24 opponents, but only one PC survived by running away.

**3 deaths**

Then they approached the beach where the ghouls are. They killed the ghoul cut in two, then fled in a boat (there are 7 other ghouls, which is *a lot* for level 1s). But one of them was paralyzed and devoured on the beach. Bad luck.

**1 death**

A little further down the river, they climbed the bridge that led them to the Wight. They stole his sword and fled, but due to a random encounter they were sandwiched by fire beetles. One of them lost his life while the others managed to escape.

**1 death**

In 7 hours, they had lost 7 characters and found the dungeon not very balanced for level 1s. I thought they were tired of dying so often, but they enjoyed the game and are keen to continue.

They had certainly been overconfident in killing the crab spider during their 1st encounter, and were relying too much on their 19\~20 AC to get through. I explained to them that they were far too quick to resort to combat and that they needed to be much more careful. For the next session, they'll go back to town to rest, equip themselves and come back with multiple retainers.

They've already explored 27 of the 60 locations, wounded the Ogre and eliminated the fauns, but only found \~1000 gp. They still have to visit the lair of the giant lizards and meet the gnomes. Then, perhaps, if they survive, they'll look for a way to get rid of the enemies they've already encountered: the 7 ghouls, the shadow, the wight and the mutant ogre. Or maybe they'll all be killed by the gnomes and their magical tree stump.

Overall, it was a good game, but perhaps a little too action-oriented. Hard to argue with an ogre or man-eating fauns. I think it was a bit frustrating for them, but players will be all the prouder ***if*** they manage to finish the dungeon next time with fewer deaths.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fa660c0>,osr,1735414427.0
A Cairn2e Play Report - By Gnomestones,"

[tavern sign, Year 880 B](https://preview.redd.it/lh2vt5fjgqme1.jpg?width=3008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47f03c0d31d3cff0d9bef07fd9c2deb1f894ff0e)

Hey everybody, I'm excited to share the newest piece of a project I've been working on recently. The story linked below is a direct adaptation of a live session of Cairn, with a player who was new to the system.

As you read the story, you;ll see how a TTRPG session inspired the text. You might even be able to pick out some of the dice rolls. I hope you like it, and any feedback is much appreciated. Thank you!

TotSK first session report!,"Excited to get an OSR game rolling but a little worried about my slightly dusty GM skills coming down off the shelf, I elected to dip into to shallow end of the pool last night with Tomb of the Serpent Kings.

The system was WB:FMAG which was just as easy to play as it was to read. I wanted something rules light so the system would get out of the way and it did exactly that. Character creation was a snap (although a pre-game printer malfunction meant that players had to draw their own character sheets) with two characters per player and the only point where it grated at all was with stocking up on items. Even with the option of preset item bundles, writing everything down and calculating Inventory weights took as long as generating the party's stats had and felt annoyingly fiddly.

After about an hour, we were ready. The party set their standard marching order, worked out who would carry the torch, and headed into the dungeon.

The players smashed the first statue they came across by accident and (despite making the poison save) this freaked them out something proper. They almost skipped past the first four rooms before one of them twigged that they could just break the statues from a distance and the gang gleefully got a-lootin'. 

Their solution to the stone door at the end of the hall was to remove the stone bar while two PCs held down the iron pegs, for everyone else to get clear, and then for the two PCs to let go of the pegs and run for it.

I'd picked out some songs beforehand to play when specific events were occuring (Bad Moon Rising for the open of the session, I'd Love to Change the World for the close) and When the Morning Comes by Hall & Oates was the perfect song to have chosen for the death theme. I described the action in slow-motion (one of the characters making it to the party safely, the other turning into a fine mist as the hammer squashed them against the door) while the tune played and the players absolutely loved it.

They woke a skeleton in the next room and combat spilled out across the whole space which was interesting. The location of torches were becoming an issue as points. There was a tense moment where a character spent a round carefully placing a torch on the ground so they could draw their bow, not wanting to drop it as a free action as the 1-in-6 chance it'd go out when it hit the floor would have plunged the melee into darkness. After the second skeleton, they worked out how to hit them with oil and set them alight and cleared the room pretty easily after that. We handed out gold star stickers for clutch kills during the battle.

The session ended at the mouth to the tunnel. The players deliberately caved in the floor, dropping the large statue that had been concealing the tunnel down into the thing so they could climb down it (they'd all forgotten to bring rope).

It was great! All the players have played DND before but they're new to the OSR playstyle and they took to it like ducks to water. The things that seemed to get them most in the headspace that this would be a different style game were:
1) Running two PCs each. This had them grinning and cracking a lot of jokes about who was going to die.
2) Tracking time with glass beads in a bowl. Every turn I dropped a glass bead in and when there were six, the torches burned down. This really got them thinking about light and time as a resource.
3) Placing a focus on light and how far they could see. Often they'd ask what was ahead and I'd say something like ""the corridor stretches beyond the edge of the light cast by your torch"" and it really put them in a sense of place. We ended up using gold coins on character sheets to indicate who was holding torches which really worked as they passed them around the group to keep everyone in light while different characters tried different strategies to solve their problems. It gave the dungeon a real sense of space and the torches felt important.

I've made it clear this is a dungeon crawl campaign (after this, we're going to Stonehell) so town is going to be largely abstracted as a menu of places they can go. I'm using downtime turns between adventures and a mini game for selling treasure / restocking which should keep the focus squarely on the dungeon. I've got a hexmap to the region which I'm filling out whenever I get fun ideas (just so it's there if they want it later on) but this session felt so more-ish and fun that I doubt they're going to tire of dungeoneering any time soon.

Thank you all for your wonderful posts, your wonderful blogs, your brilliant ideas. I don't post here often but I'm a chronic lurker and the more I learn about OSR play the more I understand how and why the best DND of my youth worked so well. It's so good getting back that feeling. I'm absolutely buzzing and cannot wait for the next game.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fa67ce0>,osr,1731403493.0

The Continued Seek of Sanrath [solo odnd play report],"https://sean-f-smith.medium.com/the-continued-seek-of-sanrath-solo-trpg-play-report-1921055c6263

# The WHO

- Sanrath, lv1 fighting dwarf, hammer + plate [AC1, 6hp, 600xp]

- Xakhaz, lv1 human channeller, leather + sling, spell: hold portal «wary hero» [AC3, 4hp]

Last session, Sanrath was beset by bandits as he was travelling alone and they feared a doppelganger. What better way to prove against shapeshifters than by travelling in groups? Thus, Sanrath tempted Xakhaz with stories of arcane archaeology.

> There’s something in the solo water these days. Skullboy has just started season two of DELVERS and there’s excellent content from Castle Grief

# The WHAT

- enter mausoleum — “I don’t recognise this place” — that’s because I’m randomly generating each delve heheh — except that you DO recognise it, because against all odds I pulled the exact same starting room. From here on out, I’ll lock these two opening rooms in as a pair.

- contents 3: monster. CUR for undead, beast, weird: it’s undead. Are they recent? Yes — this must be the remains of the bandit team from last time

- No surprise on either side and the two teams are 70FT apart, which is enough for a couple of rounds of attack volleys from our party — in the first round Sanrath hits with a headshot, taking one of the zombies out; in the second round Xakhaz does the very same. They search the bodies and salvage 4gp in coinage

- from here, west into a flowstone cavern (flowstone = fantasy concrete)

- then north to a room with shallow bridges — contents 6: trap! CUR for maim, capture, alarm: it’s alarm. The party briefly explore the room and set off the alarm! CUR for monster type again: it’s beast. From above, a slavering tombwoerm sluices from its borehole. Initiative is a tie, ie. simultaneous. However, Xakhaz’ spell is a flighty sort who wants to save the day and so he looses hold portal, sealing over the borehole as the woerm drops out. The worm has a save to avoid being trapped, but gets caught halfway out and the party makes short work of shooting tombwoerms in a puckered ceiling.
- next west, to an old cairn. Where once there was treasure, now there is none

- back to the shallow bridges then north to a sharp turn — contents 3: monster; CUR: undead, again recent; how many? NINE?! The party manage to avoid being seen and decide to make their way safely away the way they came

> 1:6 chance for new developments in each room they return to — none come up

- from the bridged junction to the north, to some genuine graves. There’s minor treasure here — 160gp of dwarfen grave goods. Sanrath recovers them. They belong in a museum, for his culture’s sake.

- back to the bridges, then east to a vast dwarfen memorial; it’s enough to move even the stoic Sanrath. Not for long though, as they climb up a cliff at the back into a naturally bored tunnel, following that east then south. No idea what made these tunnels — for they are impossibly old in their cyclopean anonymitie

- south to some priestly chambers where they recover 9gp of religious miscellany

- once more south — this time to a treasure card!

> I’m ruling these are where the major treasures are. It’s also too much of a letdown to have the other contents be the result of a single roll, so I roll twice and combine.

- Today it’s a 2 and a 3: empty and monster. What makes most sense from this point? We’ve just been through priestly rooms and we know there’s ancient undead in this complex, so clearly this must be the location of an undead priest.

- The priest is determined to be intelligent so I also roll reaction and he’s curious. Interested to see one of his kind working with a chaos wizzerd (Xakhaz will end up in a very bad place decades down the line — if you can tell me where and why, you win a prizes!) but also here to protect the dragon-dwarf statue, he’s willing to trade the statue for a favour

- As a token of his willingness, he gives over artefacts worth 360gp and asks that the party investigates the truth of the profesy he’s been meditating upon —

## The Wary Traveller Migrates

> I generated this the same way I tend to generate most rumours, but phrased it more mysticallye — adjective (as reaction roll), noun (as one of my standard oracles), verb (as room contents)

- Sanrath and Xakhaz are stumped and the undead priest explains: the Wary Traveller is the name of a constellation, and here migrates doesn’t mean moves but instead changes or alters

- They agree to help and leave with their spoils — and complete lack of wounds!

# The WHEWARDS

- Bested 4HD of monsters = 400xp

- Gained 533gp of treasure = 5330xp

- Hit major milestone = 1000xp

That’s 3365xp each, enough to level both party members:

- Sanrath, lv2 fighting dwarf, hammer + plate [AC1, 11hp, 3965xp]

- Xakhaz, lv2 human channeller, leather + sling, spell: hold portal «wary hero» [AC3, 5hp, 3365xp]

That’s a tantalising 35xp to level three ha!

Looking for a specific play report,"Hi friends!

Odd request today. A while back, maybe a year ago, something led me to a play report of a campaign that was detailed on a forum (message board). It was pretty old; as in the messages dating from the early 2000s. It was some early D&D, some like OD&D, 1st edition or B/X.

All I remember is that it was very advanced, I read a few of the last entries. They were in a dungeon or room and trying to fight a lich. They had henchmen and there was at least one use of Power Word: Kill.

I know it's not much. But if I recall, it was a pretty famous play report. I must have been looking for play examples of old-school when someone referred that.

Deep Carbon Observatory - Play Report,"Hi all, 

A few weeks back I posted about me having started DCO with my buddies, 5e players. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/10bti5f/started\_deep\_carbon\_observatory\_in\_ose\_with\_5e/](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/10bti5f/started_deep_carbon_observatory_in_ose_with_5e/)

&#x200B;

Some of you asked for updates, so here it goes :). 

Obvious spoilers!

For the ones who haven't read DCO many things might not make sense as I explain them. Ask and I will clarify more if you want :).

&#x200B;

All in all, the players are extremely careful and cautious. They choose to not really interact with much, as most of the things I describe to them seem able to kill them. They also wanted to make it to the dam as fast as possible, so they thought everything else is a waste of time in that regard. Following are the encounters they had in the flooded zone.

1. They were attacked by Ghar who killed one retainer. Could have been a PC, I let the dice decide. 
2. Fool's Duel: They manage to save both by throwing the body of the retainer to the giant fish in the water as bait.
3. Sacrophagous of Amrahatoranana: They wanted nothing to do with it, but saved the children. They wanted to send the children to the church, but then decided to first see what's there. Good so, for they would have been a snack for the giant toads. 
4. Church of the optical god: Cleared the toads with ranged weapons and found a canoe. Sent the children back to town.
5. The windmill: One of the magic-users from the encounter Fool's Duel can cast fly. So they convince him to cast it on a PC so that they can fly to jam the mechanism of the mill. After doing so, the crabs dispersed. They basically wanted to use the mill to rest since it was getting dark. They didn't care so much about the hostages inside. 
6. During the night, Echo showed up as a ""I seek refuge"" woman. She fished for information and left before the party woke up.
7. What followed was many golem and other battle encounters that the players wanted to do nothing about until they reached the tall cypress and the lifesaving library. Between these, they try to scout for the dwarf with the crossbow. They are paranoid about him.
8. Tall cypress: Thief player climbed to get the treasure. Zombies awoke, and in the battle that occurred, the Elf died by a critical hit. Rolled another PC while the battle played on. I LOVE THIS!
9. After battle, a group of the Optical god caught up, and the new PC was a member of that group. He joined up and the travel continued.
10. What followed was the Witch encounter and the eagle. Again, the players were like ""We're out of here"" and continued to the dam. One more set-up by the crows, which the players avoided in the same manner. Just go on to the dam!
11. We stopped right before the Canoptic Guards.

&#x200B;

The players are good at: avoiding battle

Bad at: fleeing from battle

Style of play so far:

They think of their own interests. They don't care about the surrounding people so much. So what if a town is demolished by a golem? What are WE supposed to do about this? We want to get to the dam. This has the benefit of not getting in danger, but the con is, exploring situations like these can get one to information or treasure. 

Excited about Friday. Dam completion and some Profundal Zone!

Play Report of Whispers in Winters Wake,"I promised u/gammlernoob I'd let him know how this went. I think the players will come back to this location because they escaped after half of them died, and they didn't even get to the boss encounter.

So I run a bi-weekly game of Knave 2e with various people at my work. I like Knave 2e in particular because its really fast and easy to get new players into. 

Because I'm using Knave 2e, I altered some of the stats to be more in line with this game's conventions. Primarily just changing HP to LVLx4 where LVL is HD. Also I changed attack rolls to match LVL. The Cultists I changed to be LVL 2, which meant they only had a +2 to hit and 8 hp rather than the +3 with 10 hp each. I had a feeling it would be dangerous, but some of my players were experienced with my GMing style, so I was sure they'd cut and run when outnumbered.

Additionally, this is probably where I fucked up, was I added a vampire antagonist to the scenario. This is one of six vampires that one of my players unleashed on the world by accident. She has been tasked by a goddess to wipe them out, but she has an undead smiting warhammer to help her with the task. So I felt like it would balance out. His goal was to steal Klaus' Cleavaxe and another magic item beneath the tree in area 6.

Onto the actual play-by-play:

They entered using the boat on the lake to enter through Area 5 after astutely asking the villagers what the best way to the cultist's hideout was. The villagers offered that they had seen smoke rising from the forest near the lakeside, meaning it was likely that was where the cultists' camp was.

They entered through area 5. The Whispers dealt 2 cold damage to 3 of the 4 PCs. After discovering the bodies in the sacks, they decided to leave them where they were. The bodies were desecrated enough and the PCs didn't have enough information on what to do with them.  The sack containing the cultists hoods immediately stood out to them as useful disguises. There were 4 PCs but only 3 hoods though, so one of them had to go without. 

They head towards area 6 straight away. The Whispers dealt another 2 damage to 2 of the PCs who had already taken damage. They were getting concerned, especially because I rolled 6 cultists in area 6. They had gotten the drop on the cultists but the Vampire was in the room with them, helping them with instructions on completing the ritual. They were getting ready to sacrifice the last villager when the PCs walked in, pretending to be cultists. 2 PCs stayed back in the ""hallway"" behind trees with crossbows. The disguised PCs were sussed out by the vampire after failing a charisma check, but were able to get close enough to separate the villager from the cultists and the vampire. The ensuing battle was bloody but the cultists failed morale after 3 of them were killed and the vampire was smote losing half of his health. Cultists and vampire fled to Area 10 through Area 8. 

The PCs considered trying to complete the ritual to get under the tree, but decided it was too evil to decapitate someone to do so. 

They ran headlong into area 8 where they were attacked by 8 cultists in waiting. this is where 2 of the 4 PCs died. The PCs understood that the cultists were waiting for them and that they were outnumbered but decided to fight anyway. One PC died basically because of the Whispers. I was a little surprised they didn't try to look for another way or to try to negotiate with them or something, but they just charged in. 

At this point, one of the dead players leaves because he had to go to work in the morning anyway. The other player who died took over the villager they just rescued, and just took her slain character's gear. The two living original PCs were badly beat up with just a handful of wound/inventory slots left each. They looked for a way out instead of trying to track the vampire further. 

The 3 of them fled south to the Chapel, in area 4. They set the chapel door on fire and squeezed around to the other side while the cultists tried to put the fire out. They found the healing Potion from the Whispers in here and took the book and knocked over the santa skeleton for good measure before fleeing south to area 3. They were fleeing quickly so they didn't have time to explore and properly lay the skeleton to rest.

In Area 3, they kept their hoods on and tried to blend in with the 5 cultists in this area. They try to be  cool and figure out a way to exit towards area 1, but as they leave they set a pile of boxes on fire and knock it over into the path of their escape. 

In Area 1, they consider how to destroy the calendar before they hear shouting behind them as the cultists pursue them. They leave through the south exit hastily so as not to be caught in another deadly fight. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In conclusion:

I think the PCs will be back. I'm considering how to further develop the area now that the PCs have kicked the beehive. I'm thinking they'll have kidnapped more victims in the meantime. I'll give Krampus and the Vampire some timers to see if they can both complete their goals by the time my players come back.

The scenario was pretty deadly just on account of the number of cultists. I'm not sure if I read the numbers correctly. My reading initially was that \[2x\] or \[3x\] indicated that number times the number of PCs, but maybe the author's intention was just that number of cultists. Fire is really deadly as a weapon, something my players are sure to take advantage of in the future.

The Statue of Ashburn - Session Report,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1f8uw15bmu9c1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=787274cf47973b19118f520165a79cde5acce9a5

(Session report running a fantasy adventure game for a group of rpg newbies with a wide variety of ages i.e. kids to grandparents).

**The Statue of Ashburn** 

**Introduction**

*Our party of adventurers entered the village of Ashburn on a sunny summers day to find the place quiet and deserted. Our group consisted of Lady Nova and Lady Sky, the daughters of Lord Jameson ruler of the local lands who have been sent on a mission to visit the local villagers whom they are sworn to protect as part of their education. Accompanying them is their bodyguard, the young noble knight Sir Gallant along with the expert hunter and tracker Aurora and finally making up the group is the ladies tutor Friar Hugh, their educator and advisor.*

* *Lady Sky, Level 1 Human Mage*
* *Lady Nova, Level 1 Human Mage*
* *Sir Gallant, Level 1 Human Knight*
* *Aurora, Level 1 Human Ranger*
* *Friar Hugh, Level 1 Human Cleric*

This was the first face to face session I was running in a long time and I was running the game for a group of rpg newbies with a broad age range (from 6yrs old to teenagers to someone in their 70’s) and I was using my home-brew system (Heroes of Adventure). In view of the age range I was going to keep the tone fairly light (i.e. avoiding graphic detail and heavy violence for example).

To keep things nice and simple, I had pre-generated the characters and matched the heroes roles with the profile of the players (i.e. the youngest two played the two daughters and the eldest player portrayed Friar Hugh). With little to no rpg playing experience in the group the rules were broken down into the following two points.

1. This is a ‘story’ game where you each portray a character (like a part in a play). You play most of the game by telling me what you would like your character to do and I will then explain what happens next.
2. Sometimes, I may ask you to roll a dice to determine the outcome of an action. You roll the d20 die and the higher result the better.

Each player was given a character sheet and their own set of dice (which they could keep afterwards as a momento of their first ever game) and I made sure to give each person a couple of interesting pieces of equipment (potions, scrolls etc) they could use in the game and then we jumped into the first scene.

In addition, I had hand drawn a map of the rooms (on A3 paper) which I could piece together or replace as they moved from room to room. I had created some 2D miniatures to help the group visualise their characters exploring the adventure location. During the exploration phase I simply asked them to move and position their characters where they wanted and would ‘pause’ them somewhere if this led to a clue, hazard or encounter.

**The Adventure**

*The group made their way to the centre of the village to see a woman kneeling down and sobbing next to a stone statue. Some gentle questioning and interaction revealed some ruffians had broken the hand of the statue and stolen it away and were last seen heading towards the abandoned temple at the edge of the forest. The stone statue was said to bring good fortune and fertile lands to the village and the missing piece must be returned otherwise some corruption may befall the village. To emphasise the point, the grass near the foot of the statue had started to darken and turn to ash.*

This was the players first NPC interaction with the visibly upset villager (Merelle) and was intended to set the scene and give them a clear objection (return the missing piece of the statue) and a destination (the abandoned temple). The party wanted to make sure Merelle was safe and I gently fast-forwarded her safe return home and moved them onto the front of the temple where the adventure started.

*The party arrived at an old abandoned template forgotten by time on the edge of the forest, its moss covered stone features suggesting it has been abandoned for centuries. A large twisting gnarled tree seems to have grown through the building from the inside with its roots and branches weaving around and through crumbling walls. As you approach the sturdy oaken entrance door you hear a voice snapping at you from behind the door.*

*The words were unclear to most of the party however, Lady Nova and Friar Hugh understand the darkling tongue, the language spoken by Goblins, Wretches and other underground dwelling creatures. The words were translated to ‘I am King Snotweezle and you have trespassed on my lands. You are not welcome here, go away!”. From further behind the door, the party could also hear the deep growling sounds of some sort of beast inside the temple.*

This encounter introducted the main protagonist King Snotweezle, a dastardly, cunning but cowardly Goblin and sign-posted a potential danger (the beasts) inside the first room. After a brief interaction, King Snotweezle closed the door and ran away, the chase was on.

*Sir Gallant bravely sprinted forward and opened the door followed by the rest of the group which revealed a room with crumbling pillars either side and a set of steps ahead leading to another room. Next to the steps were two very large makeshift kennels from which the group could hear some deep growls and the clanking of chains, there was no sign of King Snotweezle. As they entered the room from within the shadows of the kennel they could make out the movement of two very large wolves (Direwolves) within the shadows of the kennels.*

This was the players first challenge, two powerful creatures potentially blocking the party’s advance although the clanking of chains suggested they were locked up. The youngest player of the group (6 years old!) cleverly identified her sleeping potion as an option and they poured the potion over some fresh meat carried by the Ranger and threw two slabs of doctored meet into the kennels. I made a check to see how this would affect each of the wolves with one falling asleep and one resisting.

I had some printed pictures of any monsters and adversaries and displayed the picture of the fearsome Direwolf to help the players visualise the beast.

The group scoured their equipment and found one carried some wolfsbane (which I indicated was a toxic plant wolves do not like) and allowed then to throw it near the kennel so the remaining Direwolf so it retreated back and the party continued onwards having overcome the first challenge.

*The party entered a long wide hallway in a darkened room, to the right a stair case covered in thick cobwebs led up to an attic level and ahead stood a closed wooden door.*

There was some brief debate about which direction to head and the group correctly decided that King Snotweezle didn’t go upstairs otherwise he would have damaged the cobwebs leaving a trail. They searched the hallway and identified some scuff marks on the floor which they found was caused by a shifting wall leading to a secret chamber to the left.

*The party peered into the secret chamber which was covered in loose rocks and debris fallen from an unstable ceiling. In the centre of the room lay a large wooden table and chairs and a wooden hatch leading downwards. However, their eyes were drawn to an open wooden chest full of sparking gems and jewels which sparkled and glistened lighting up the room.*

The chest was an illusion created by the crafty King Snotweezle as a diversion and the group resisted the temptation to interact with a seemingly obvious trap/distraction. They searched the room and opened the hatch which led down to a deeper level in the darkness. They sent one of the players familiars (a cat named Midnight) into the tunnel and after a few minutes of waiting and then gently calling for its return it sprinted back covered in sweat and seemingly startled (signposting a potential danger in the deeper level).

*Friar Hugh cautioned the group as to the potential dangers below and they made their way out of the chamber back into the hallway and through the wooden door which led to a room where the structural integrity of the floor had succumbed to the advance of nature as roots and branches had ripped up the floor causing it to warp and break leaving loose earth, dust, debris, holes and unstable flagstones. The party could see another wooden door at the far end of the room.*

This room was a trap due to the instability of the floor. However, on the physical map I had drawn some faint footsteps in the dust which successfully led them to the door. No checks or dice rolls were required this was simply a ‘player’ test to see if they could work out the (fairly obvious) clue. The group successfully navigated the correct route to the next room.

I had been making random encounter checks every turn but so far the party had been careful with their approach and hadn’t encountered any denizens.

*Opening the wooden door led to a dimly lit room where the stone walls and ceiling were buckling under the weight of large tree roots growing through the ceiling. The wall and ceiling has collapsed on one side of the room leaving rocks, stones and boulders although this was now covered in thick cobwebs. In the centre of the room stood a large statue of a man formed of rock who stands in front of an impressive looking portcullis leading to a room beyond. Two additional passageways lead north and south.*

This room gave the party a few options (i.e. which way to explore). However, hidden amongst the collapsed wall and ceiling were a couple of dormant Giant Spiders which could be awoken. The party examined the statue but found no way to activate it (the solution was elsewhere) and tried to open the portcullis which was sealed shut due to a rusted chain. Sir Gallant started to smash the chain with his mace which echoed loudly around the room and awoke the Giant Spiders which moved to attack. Aurora the Ranger had the highest senses skill and I allowed a check to see if she heard their approach. A low roll meant the party were surprised the Giant Spiders tore into the group biting both Sir Gallant and Aurora causing minor wounds before the party rallied and defeated the spiders.

I usually run an ‘individual initiative’ approach (i.e. everyone rolls individually with group rolls for similar monsters and we take it in turns from highest to lowest). However, at the table with several excited players each wanting to do something I found it easier to control the combat turn from a ‘side initiative’ (monsters act then players act in turn) along with a ‘left to right’ approach around the table. Having established this approach people then knew when it would be their turn and everyone had a chance to act in the spotlight.

The combat encounter wasn’t difficult with strength of numbers leading to a quick victory with a few minor wounds.

*Sir Gallant decided that whilst he could break the chain eventually the noise was likely to attract more creatures and the party took the northern passageway through a door to a large room which unfolded like a vibrant tapestry of life with an array o lush greenery and plants covering the room from floor to ceiling. In the heart of the room lay a raised well adorned with soft moss and delicate vines connecting the plants. A wooden door stood closed at the far side of the room.*

The group examined and tested the waters (dipping a staff then tasting a mouthful) in the well which had healing properties (the lush foliage all around being the clue) and those people with wounds healed themselves. No dice rolls were used at all here, this was simply determined by player descriptions of their actions.

*Moving through the exit of the garden room led to a large unstable room, the ceiling above had collapsed leaving piles of rock and rubble on the floor next to thick roots which had grown upwards from below making travel potentially hazardous. In the centre of the room lay a marble statue of a cloaked woman, it had fallen and lay broken in two pieces on the floor. A further passageway led south ahead of the group.*

The group searched the room and found a gold rimmed key hung on a small chain on the neck of the statue and cautiously navigated the hazardous terrain. If a combat situation was to take place this may have presented a danger of slipping or tripping but with sufficient time and care the group moved on.

*The passageway led to a flight of stairs leading down and a locked door. Using the gold rimmed key from the previous room they opened the door to reveal a dust filled library, the musty air and dust causing the party to cough and sneeze. Within the room were shelves full of books, scrolls and parchments in various condition from readable to tattered fragments. From the amount of dust in the room, no-one had been in here for quite some time.*

The group searched the room, Lady Sky using her magic lodestone to feel the vibration of magic leading her to finding two scrolls (Sleep and Animation). The remaining party members searched for useful books and particular any reference to King Snotweezle. This was a reasonable idea but the temple had been built centuries before King Snotweezle had lived so flawed idea but I did allow a random roll (d20, high good, low bad) to see if they could find anything useful which led to one character finding a book on the biology and ecology of monsters.

*Putting away the books and scrolls from the library, the group cautiously made their way down the flight of steps lighting a lantern to illuminate their path ahead. A winding set of steps led to an underground room which was dominated by a large tree trunk growing in the centre of the room with various roots and branches extending outwards. Surrounding the walls of the room were different suits of armour on stands and hanging on the walls were shields and an assortment of old, dusty and rusted weapons. Lying next to the tree was the form of a green skinned humanoid leaving over the inert form of another of its species laid upon a bed of leaves but firmly held in place by a tree root.*

This was the final encounter room where the story outcome would be revealed. Through a series of interactions and discussions the party identified the humanoid as King Snotweezle and the unconscious goblin as Griselda his Queen who was suffering some curse or sickness for which he required the hand of the statue (which contained a healing gem). This left the party with a simple dilemma of how to approach this situation and to complicate matters as they approached the tree, the form of a Wood Weird revealed itself as the source of the tree growth and curse.

A scene of chaos unfolded which was manic but good fun with some of the group trying to fight off the powerful and intimidating Wood Weird, some of the group trying to revive Griselda, one member of the party trying to steal back the statue hand from King Snotweezle and then trying to assassinate him with another member of the party trying to prevent harm coming to him. 

Having got a feel for their skills and abilities we had a series of illusions being created, the animate scroll being used to animate tree roots to crush King Snotweezle and then backfiring (natural 1) and causing the roots to start to crush the caster, the lantern and oil being thrown at the Wood Weird, the Knight stoutly defending his ground and losing his shield under a powerful attack by the Wood Weird.

Eventually, the group cut the roots away from Griselda and Friar Hugh used his healing hands to help Griselda recover. Lady Nova stole the statue hand from Snotweezle who then escaped with Griselda through a portal he cast. Friar Hugh led Lady Sky and Lady Nova away having recovered the statue hand leaving Aurora the Ranger and Sir Gallant the Knight to defend their retreat and fight off the Wood Weird which was narrowly defeated with both suffering serious wounds (down to a few health points left each). 

We fast forwarded to the epilogue to finish off the story. The statue hand was returned and resealed to the statue allowing the lands to once again grow to the thanks of the villagers of Ashburn. The party rested and recovered from their wounds having gained some valuable knowledge and experience of potential threats and dangers in then lands. Alas, King Snotweezle had escaped but his card was marked by members of the party although there was some healthy tension concerning his motives (to save Griselda) and the extent of his punishment should he be captured in the future.

**Post Adventure Notes**

Everyone enjoyed the game and participated and contributed to the story so I hope it was a success. I even received a message the next day to say the youngsters had still been talking about the adventure a day later and were looking forward to part 2 at some point in the future. 

A few things that I think worked well considered I was running the game for a group of newcomers with a wide variety of ages.

* We broke a 3-4 hour session into two parts with a lunch break which kept everyone’s concentration levels up.
* All I asked of the players was ‘tell me what you want to do/what’s your intent’ and I translated these into options with an idea of success/consequence (there’s a good chance this will work, you can try it but this might happen). The players could then make informed decisions over their actions and didn’t need to learn any rules to play the game.
* Giving a set of dice the players could keep was a nice token to remember the game by.
* We used pre-generated characters and dived straight into the game and only referred to the character sheet when needed. The only thing the players needed to track was their health score (hit points) and each player had a yellow ‘post it’ note they used to do this.
* I played a fast and flexible with the rules to keep the story moving forward which was mainly narration (i.e. 80%) with some (i.e. 20%) dice rolling.
* Using maps and miniatures gave the players visual references and something tangible to interact with (i.e. moving their character around the map).
* I kept the story simple and clear and introduced the dilemma (i.e. the protagonists motive) towards the end.
* I gave the players lots of things they could use (scrolls, potions etc) and interact with and encouraged lateral thinking (i.e. the sleeping potion on the meat to put the Direwolves to sleep).
* From a personal perspective, I don’t run a lot of games and have only really play with the same group of players (for many many years) but running a game with youngsters I felt more comfortable embellishing the NPC’s and monsters actions and behaviours (voices, sound effects, interactions etc) which (I hope) they enjoyed.

A few things which I’ve taken away as potential refinements for my home-brew system.

* ‘Side initiative’ and players acting in a clear sequence (left to right around the table) was quicker and much clearer to players and easier to follow then individual initiative.
* I have an idea on how I can streamline the limits on ability use (i.e. feats) even further to make this even easier for players to follow.
* I use a slot based inventory system but would like to design equipment tokens to provide some more tangible components the players can interact with.
* We didn’t track XP (as it was a one-shot) but this did make we think about the merits of a milestone vs. Individual XP award approach.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fa0a990>,osr,1704123668.0

By Demons Driven: Session 1 of my play report of Demon-Bone Sarcophagus,"Hello! As I have discussed doing in the past, I am running Demon-Bone sarcophagus for one player.

We playedthe other day, and here’s the report about how I set up the game and how it’s going! 

Cade Vivente is a thief who works on commission for the wealthy and powerful to take down other wealthy and powerful people on their behalf.

He does this because he was betrayed by the elite, and he takes the opportunity to hurt them whenever he can. He gave some of his ill-gotten go to the poor, but he justifies it as taking down the system.  He is in fact something of a softy, but denies it to everyone, including himself.

In Azag, ( the system I am running the module in) players start with a randomly rolled up magic item.

He ended up with a luminous dagger of the past.

It is a dagger that close with a light that spells invisibility and delusions, and the special quality of the dagger is that it allows him to use psychometry they doing a luck test. ( in this game even if you are successful testing your luck, lowers it by one.)

He has been hired by mysterious figure, known only as the gray man .

These were his instructions .

“ you must go to this place, at this time.”

(The starting location and time of the adventure .)

“You were looking for a certain person. You will obtain a set of papers from them. They are not expecting you and they will not want to part with them. How you get them is up to you.”

“ this person is probably a woman, but it is unclear. They will have a permanent blue mocking somewhere on the exposed upper portion of the body. So either their hands, Arms or face.”

“ they will be carrying two sets of papers. One is a set of plans for a very intricate highest of a very dangerous location that would produce enormous amounts of wealth and gain is one could do it successfully and survive.”

“ the other is a set of travel brochures. I want the brochures. You may do with the plans as you wish.”

( unbeknownst to my player. The gray man is a Ven. A time traveler, from the very end of Time. His impressive, but vague knowledge is due to the vagaries of records in the far far future.)

So Kate shows up right after the desert is briefly turned into Hell by a whole bunch of desperate people, somebody into each other at once, and then killing the F out of each other .

He chooses not to haul ass when he sees the disemboweled woman attempting to stab a teenage boy to death so the teenager does get stabbed a bit but cade manages to  patch him up.

He manages to get the prepackaged information for both of them and I’m actually really satisfied with it. Reading it initially I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to improv it without sounding like I was giving cans text which in fact I was but it really came out natural in my player afterwards that he liked the interactions. 

She dies after pretty much spilling her side of the plot and how the clerk Bonvive set them up as disappeared into the dungeon with the plans. Along with their leader, Drusilla.

Teenage boy talked about his side of the story with the company, security force, and how his Sergeant has disappeared into the dungeon.

My player had a reason to investigate all of the corpses because he had to be sure that  Bonvive wasn’t actually dead in the Melee. And since he hadn’t come prepared to explore a dungeon, he did not have rope with him, and it gave him a reason to check everyone for survival gear.

Then, when he started investigating the best entrance to go into the dungeon, he found Tooth -Tooth.

This is where my player surprise me. Using incredibly adept verbal judo he managed to convince both of these rival faction aligned individuals that he was on their side and then he was only using the other one as muscle temporarily.

I legitimately had to take my head off to him. He did it really convincingly so it worked!

No, the shit is really gotta hit the fan when he runs into the sergeant or the smuggler because he’s not gonna be able to keep them from fighting no matter how good his role is.

The company forces killed several of his baboons, and Wensley will not take that lightly.

So this took some real game time, and we actually ended with my player, deciding that he was going to descend into the sloth whole, possibly because of the ruby glints because he is a treasure seeker .

This is great! Because we stop there this is going to give me the ability to make sure I’m super familiar with all of the rooms attached to that entrance.

Also, now he has been introduced to all the above ground factions when he runs into them he’s gonna have some kind of idea how the interaction might go although of course, he might be surprised . ( I am using a random disposition table to make it surprising even for me and then I’ll come up with a justification for any weird result. I love random tables because he keeps it interesting and unpredictable even for me the GM.)

So the great thing about the fact that he is going to go into the dungeon with both of these figures that are in fact, opposed to each other is that this creates immediate drama when they run into certain figures that are already in the dungeon .

In my other post, I had talked about my concern about the cheap instant kill abilities of two of the monsters  Reductor and Boreala. I mean, technically the Fall Witch doesn’t instantly kill you.

She picks you up, cuts all your armor and equipment off you and rapidly flies through the dungeon to her apartments where she sticks you on a magic iron torture tree with one hit point , half conscious in agony .

Refuctor removes your soul if she can get to attacks and then one round .

So the fact that there will be at least two NPC’s accompany him for at least the wild means that if they show up, I can use them is Canon fodder to demonstrate the awful nature of these opponents .

Depending on some random dice road, probably the teenage boy because that will be extra traumatizing. I’m playing him as appealingly, naïve and stupid. So semi useless, but in a way that I think I already has gotten my player attached to him to protect him. 

Cade is not nearly the feeling less bad ass that he pretends to be.

Anyway, thank you so much for reading this giant wall of text! 

If anyone has any questions, comments or criticism or advice, I would love to hear it! 

We are probably going to start right with him about to enter the dungeon  this coming week. 

I will keep my campaign journals to once a week to keep from be being monotonous in the feed.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11faaa2a0>,osr,1677852214.0
"Hot spring Island with WNN, first session play report and thought","This is a recap of my first session of Hot spring Island, using WWN. I felt that the island was maybe a little too dangerous for starting characters, so I went halfway between standard and heroic rule to give them some safety net. 3 partial class for everyone and 6 bonus hit point. If you are playing hot spring island or plan to at some time as a player, you probably should not read this because spoiler. Tldr at the end.

Character :

Albincourt : Full Expert + partial warrior. Mercenary, he have seen war, he have seen places, he have seen everything. Whatever you’ve seen he have a story like yours but better. He’s here for the money.

Hari sala Maomedi : Full warrior + blood priest : The god lives in the blood inside and outside of you. He’s here to find unholy thing to kill and spread the word of blood.

Chabadi Wapu: Full necromancer + bard. (Ex?)Slave, “Member of the great Wapu Familly. You probably already heard about them, but never saw one of them”. He’s here to make money to pay student dept, also want to make some skeleton dance. Not completely clear if he was sold to Martel or if he’s here of his own will.

Robert Ducorbeau: Full warrior + beastmaster : fortyish years old rugged woodsman, he came the swordfish islands with his giant doberman after being chased away by the petty king of the land where he poached for the last decade.

Veim-mar Creuset : Full highmage + partial warrior. Weird dwarven mage. He look like he’s cool and charismatic until you speak to him. Then you realize he’s neither cool nor charismatic. He’s been sent to the Swordfish Islands to make an internship to complete his mage training.  My guess is that his master sent him here to die.

The game start and they are on a supply ship on it’s way to HS09. They’ve been given a oiled leather tube filled with rolled parchment page (the field guide). They already got the first hint of the riches if these islands when they realised the few silver pieces they had could not buy them anything since Rand’s retreat deal’s are made with gold. They are going to be paid 50 piece of gold for every location they can map that’s not already in the field guide and more if they can locate the den of the giant beast roaming the island.

On their way to the island, after asking a few questions to the supply ship captain (nobody looked at the field guide for the moment), they learned that :

\- There is no human settlement on the island, but there are ogre living in the north and Fuegonauts that are likely living near the volcano.

\- The giant beast is some king of giant boar and has mostly been seen in the north of the island.

The ship make its way to HS09 from the south, they see the southern cliffs and large ruins. After asking if there are less sea bird at some specific place(looking for hint of the beast?) They notice that there are a lot more sea birds on HS14 (Feasting on crab remain).

&#x200B;

Day 1 

AM watch : They beach on the alabaster stair(HS09-01) and debate for some time on if they should built a camp or start exploring. The supply ship will be back in three days

After some deliberation, they decided to follow the beach north. Robert, leading the party, spotted something glowing orange in the foliage on the ground. Upon inspection, it was snake with scales seemingly made of copper. It was watching them warily. Veim-mar and Albincourt wanted to catch the snake but while they where deliberating, Robert decided to shoot it with his bow. The snake, scratched but still full of vigour, bolted in the undergrowth and disappeared. They resume their trek along the coast to non numbered beach hex west of HS-05

PM watch : 

They hear fighting nearby. An earth imp fighting is fighting a water elemental they watch the fight, asking themselves what to do. The imp make the elemental retreat and find them. He start speaking to them and he speaks a lot. In this, he find a friend in Albincourt, who loves to tell his stories.

The Imp (Named Dwayne) tell them he can lead them to the cave they are searching for it’s just north of the volcano. They follow him east toward HS05 while he speaks non-stop.

Dusk watch :

They fing a haggard man walking in the wood alone. He’s called Ivann Blackhand and he's carrying a small keg. (Wow, first day on the island and they already found some Sipopa, this is gonna be wild)

He tell them he’s been alone for a few days after his squad was ambushed by salamanders. He lost track of time and was hiding in a ruin. He don’t remember about the location of the ruin (lie) and he is trying to find his way back to the next supply ship. He look lost when he’s told that the next ship is in 3 days.

The party notice the black vein going up Ivann arm from his hands. He doesn’t know what it is and after being if he touched weird plant he respond that they are surrounded by weird plant and he can’t tell. The party ask Dwayne if know about a safe place or cave to rest nearby. Dwaynes points them toward the northern slave quarter entrance but Ivann tells them that the place is heavily guarded by salamanders.

Reflecting on the danger Dwayne’s naiveness pose on them, they witness him petrifying a dying hare to protect him. Terrified, they decide to ask Dwayne to go ask for entry to the salamanders and use the opportunity to ghost him.

Early night watch:

Albincourt takes the first guard and he see Ivann taking a chug of orange liquid from keg. Thinking it’s alcohol Albincourt ask some but Ivann seems reticent, He tell he can share, but there is not enough for everyone. Albin tell him that he can always buy more alcohol later and he should share now. When Ivann tell him that it’s not alcohol, but a special drink that he found in the ruin. Albincourt change his mind.

Second is taken by Robert and everything is clear.

Late Night watch:

Chabadi takes the third guard but since he doesn’t need to sleep he decide to keep up until the morning, not waking up Hari sala and Veim-mar, as he is supposed too.

As the night sky begin to lighten, Chabadi hear noise from something big coming their direction. He wake up Robert, who wake up the rest of the party. Chabadi goes on recon to see what is approaching. His fine dress get stuck in branches and he his immediately spotted by the approaching band of night axe ogres (4 warriors, 2 edgesworn and a bonebinder). The party is terrified and they try to parlay with ogres. They offer their services and help to get on the good side of the ogre before things go south. 

Day 2

AM Watch

As the sun rise, they find themselves hesitantly assisting a night axe raid on the Slave quarter north entrance.

Robert and one edgesworn go on recon but the salamander hear noise in the wood. They are now on alert. Dwayne is still there speaking with a bored salamander.

Albincourt is afraid that they will be used as mercenary cannon fodder. The Bonebinder gives a busy bone bone to Chabadi and tells the ogre and the party that the plan is to strike fast and hard and retreat after, don’t be stupid and die on this. 

Session ends

Tldr : Party land on HS09, they are searching for dire boar lair. Go north meet earth imp who propose to guide them. They meet a lost martel marine carrying a keg of orange liquid. They ghost the eart imp. They camp foe the night and encounter a night axe party. They find themselves dragged in a raid party against the slave quarter north entrance.

&#x200B;

Tought on all of this :

* Improvisation in general and especially getting in the head of different npc with different motivation is definitively where I struggle the most. Hotspring island does a great job to help with this with all the information about character, faction and everything on the island. It will still be a big challenge give life to all of this while not kicking myself too much.
* Until the encounter with the earth imp and elemental, they asked a lot of questions about if their character knew about this thing or this thing. When I reminded them that they info they were searching was probably in the field guide thing started to get into place.
* My players (and my) experience mainly comes from pathfinder and dnd 3/3.5/5. I still need to shift from paradigm and ask more about what and how the character are doing thing instead of skill roll.
* I'm really surprised and curious about their early encounter with sipopa and how will this evolve.
* I will pre-prep few encounter (and the slave quarter) for next sessions, I had a hard time wrapping my head around some encounters on the fly.
* I made this report to take notes, tool to think about what I liked or not with my GMing and to practice my english. I took way longer than I though so I will probably change the form if I continue this.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11faa9700>,osr,1671041359.0

Death In Space play report pt. 1,"Me and my group finally got around to playing Death In Space last night. Our randomly generated player characters were:

A cranky Solpod named Sakura

A tired Velocity Cursed named Marshal

An energetic Void named “Jo”

And a straightforward Punk named Lovi

We started in my homebrew system of Moose Space, on the blue-sands planet of Fry. Fry is a major exporter of ice as frozen water which can be heated into drinking water across the system. 

Sakura and Jo had just crash landed on Fry after some poor driving decisions that we didn’t flesh out, while Marshal and Lovi chewed ice in a space bar (disgusting but appropriate for locals of Fry). The two stranded made their way to the gates of the city, but when the guards on the walls denied them access due to the city curfew, Sakura activated a void point that she received from failed negotiation and used a Cosmic Mutation: tech-talker. She told the metallic gates to “open,” and sure enough they let the Solpod and the Void in for a short time.

With Jo and Sakura quickly running into a space bar to recuperate, the two halves of the party finally ran into each other. Sakura immediately criticized Marshal for crunching ice in his mouth, but Lovi managed to temporarily convince her otherwise.

A couple guards ran into the bar to look for Sakura and Jo, but after two rounds of initiative Jo had hurt them both with an empty bottle. After Marshal got a notification from the spaceport to move his ship, Jo and Sakura begged Lovi and Marshal to get them off of Fry.

Reluctant but looking forward to a potential adventure, Marshal and Lovi led the party to their spacecraft: the Frymobile, a bright yellow spacecraft in the shape of a singular French fry.

What do you all think so far? Let me know. I will write the other half when I can.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11faa8da0>,osr,1678626199.0
Ongoing play report and questions from a new GM (OSE / B/X) *Spoilers for The Tower of Shadow Silveraxe*,"My solo/duo campaign continues with my partner who is running a party of six characters at the moment. They started with *The Tomb of the Serpent Kings* and are currently exploring the Gemthrone Wilderness from *The Shadow of Tower Silveraxe* using the OSE ruleset. I've been trying to keep track of situations that made me realize I wasn't sure what the RAW was supposed to be and had to improvise a ruling and just go with it. Though I'm still curious to find out.  


Some highlights:

&#x200B;

* Last session we cleared the Shrine on the Lake dungeon. The party took the boat to the shore of the isle (3-4 at a time since I figured a fishing boat couldn't hold all 6). I rolled a check for an encounter each trip across the lake to or from the shore. The only dice which rolled an encounter was some Giant Bass but I noticed the Monster entry for them says they are shy and will only attack halflings or smaller creatures (none in the party) so I ruled they could just see them circling in the water.
* The party distracted the water termites inside the cave entrance by throwing an unused or spent torch into the water away from the direction they wanted to go. Made sense to me. 
* Rather than fight the sleeping stirges perched from a statue holding the key, my player had one character reach with their 10' pole to carefully push the key out of the hands of the statue while another party member made a Dexterity check to catch the falling key without missing it and it making noise that would awaken the stirges. Was this too easy? I haven't used many Ability checks but that seemed like the right way to model the challenge. I didn't call for a surprise check since the text specified that the stirges were asleep unless disturbed and the player noted the two characters were trying to go slow and be very quiet.
* I said every closed door was stuck because I assume that is part of the balance of the dungeon exploration rules. So, with opening stuck doors, I assume the first roll (which determines if entities on the other side of the door can be surprised or not) is the one that matters since they or other characters can just try to force the door open again. I thought of the house rule that party members can cooperate to all try to force the door open at the same time and increase their X-in-6 chance by combining each partner's bonus. Equal to or greater than 6 is an automatic success therefore. Doors are supposed to be stuck right?
* In a fight with skeletons in a small room, the Cleric turned undead again and (justlike in *TotSK*) all I could think of was describing the skeleton fleeing by turning around and clawing desperately against the stone walls so furiously that its bones are slowly grinding against the stone into dust. And that's all it ends up doing each turn because what else could it do? I also ruled the Thief could get in a backstab because of that.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11faaa2d0>,osr,1677388978.0
Death In Space play report pt. 3,"When last we left Team Fry (we got a party name!), the party of Sakura the solpod, Marshal the velocity cursed, ""Mo"" the Void, and Lovi the punk had met up for the first time. They fought some guards, took off into space on Marshal's *Frymobile*, noticed some strange steel spheres, and Lovi had a near-death incident involving suffocating and quickly losing oxygen while exploring a ship that looked eerily similar to Marshal's-- and housed cryogenically frozen clones of the party members, too.

Somehow, Lovi gained a new power in this incident: he received a Cosmic Mutation which allowed him to temporarily go without a spacesuit in space...

Now, we return to our party, disturbed but willing to move on.

## Recap

The next session began right where the previous one left off. As Lovi recovered while Sakura and Mo kept watch, Marshal locked himself in the control room and kept on trucking, eventually coming across a massive space station with decals of the smiling and frowning play masks on the hull.

Over the radio, a booming voice said, ""DO YOU WANT TO SEE A CABARET?"" Marshal immediately disagreed, but Sakura decided to say ""sure, I'd like to do that!""

The massive space station began using a tractor beam, drawing the *Frymobile* closer and closer to it, but Sakura changed her mind and used her Cosmic Mutation: Tech-Talker. Sakura beckoned the tractor beam to stop, and it did so.

Clearly angered, a smaller vessel flew out of the Floating Cabaret's port and began firing on the *Frymobile*. Now is an important time to mention an important fact: the *Frymobile* has no laser cannons. Marshal nimbly dodges the cannons, but the spaceship launches a warrior dressed in a metallic suit at the *Frymobile*. Using a laser pistol, Lovi fires a round at the cord the warrior is attached to.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11faa83e0>,osr,1679090767.0
One Year of Session Reports,"This coming Sunday will be the one year anniversary of my current ACKS game. I thought that makes a fine time to mention my ongoing session reports over on the RPG Pub, for anyone who is interested.

So far, it's mostly been dungeoneering, in Dwimmermount and my own Mazen Kurz, with a few sessions of hexcrawling.

Death In Space play report pt. 4,"The adventures over the next few days are… complicated.

After flying through space for a while (time is honestly quite hard to quantify in space), a wave of temporal energy passes over the ship, and all of the members of the party age by different amounts of years. Notably, Sakura becomes much, *much* taller.

The party trudges on through space, eventually coming across a gruesome sight: a line of corpses floating through open space, which leads to an abandoned space station. The station is named the *Piano-Man*, and idle piano lobby music plays as the party enters, while Marshal blasts “Funkytown” from the ship to annoy the rest of the party and keep himself sane.

Following the piano music over the intercom to its source, the party finds a tech room littered with buttons. Clearly enjoying the amount of buttons inside this room, Sakura creates a smiley face out of lit buttons and then wipes the entire button board with her hands. In the process, Sakura bumps a random button, which opens up a part of the hull that wasn’t affected by whatever caused the wreck of the *Piano-Man*, and a briefcase preserved in the hull. Inside there are:

* 20 holos.
* A photo of a happy couple on a beachfront, the mustachioed husband being in pilot regalia. Sakura determines the photo was taken on Crayon.
* Two AA batteries.

Sakura quickly snags the 20 holos and the photo, too, saying that she will track down whoever this photo belongs to if she goes to Crayon. If anything else she wants to return the photo so a ceremony can be held. The party goes back to the *Frymobile*

On the way out of the radius of the *Piano Man*, the party notices a group of bandits dismantling a ship, piece by piece, and adding the scrap to their own vessel. The party decides not to intervene.

A couple days later, the party arrives at a roadside attraction: the Split Ends Asteroid Bar. Deciding to stop for some well-earned alcohol, the crew of the *Frymobile* makes their way into the hollow asteroid hangar below the bar. As the party gets out of the vehicle, they are immediately approached by two Voids: one absolutely jacked and the other one wearing robes and making loud crunching noises out of their mask.

The ripped one introduces the two as Reaper and Crunch, and that they are hitchhikers in need of a transport to “anywhere that isn’t the bar.” Reaper promises to pay for any drinks the party takes at the bar, on the condition that they have to take him and Crunch to the *Frymobile*‘s next stop as a favor.

Eager to get some free asteroid whiskey, Marshal agrees.

The party walks into the asteroid bar as a group, noticing a man who looks like a clone of David Bowie and a small child following him. Sakura talks to the two, learning that the man is in fact a failed clone of David Bowie and the child is named Lincolnlog- apparently thanks to a prize contest on Durf. Disturbed, Sakura slowly walks away.

A shadow appears in the hall as two sharpshooters with deer heads walk into the bar. Bamb and Wilkes are their names, and Sakura immediately asks them about everything they have, while Mo keeps watch and asks them about their most dangerous mission. After revealing that they work for the Antlers, a bandit gang run by the infamous Headhunting Moose Man, Wilkes explains that their hardest mission involved an ambush on Crayon, a fake correspondent, and a lot of battle robots in a battle robot factory.

After talking to Bamb and Wilkes, Mo joins Marshal in hitting the booze, but Marshal hits the booze the hardest, downing more than ten shots. After shot eleven, Marshal finally falls to the ground, and he discovers the heavy drinking actually brought him down to 0 hit points…

In his near death experience Marshal sees a tree. This tree is floating in space, yet the tree isn’t dying; on the contrary, its leaves are green and full of life. Marshal debates passing on, but he realizes that perhaps there isn’t ice to chew in the afterlife…

In the waking world, it’s a very frantic situation. Reaper explains he has syringes, but he doesn’t know if they heal or harm. Team Fry keeps hitting Marshal with syringes, and they turn out to be healing syringes, but every time they remove one, they inexpertly do so and leave a wound on Marshal’s shoulder, bringing him back to 0 hit points…

Reaper is on his last syringe, which he reluctantly gives to the party. The party carefully places it in and gently removes it, finally bringing Marshal back into stable condition.

Sakura tries to get Reaper a drink, but Marshal wakes up to tell Sakura “no.” Reaper immediately gets angry at Marshal, telling him how many holos Marshal made him pay with, telling him how Marshal wasted all of his syringes, and finally ordering him at laser pistol-point to “keep driving…”

Knaves of Illmire - Session zero and introductory funnel report.,"I've been recruiting players so that I can run Evils of Illmire, and we recently started. I've decided to try Knave, with some house rules. 


Most of my players have only played 5e, so I decided to run a Session zero with a short funnel-style lead-in to Illmire. For this, I reskinned the one-page dungeon ""The Burial Mound of Gilliard Wolfclan,"" by Josh Burnett, replacing the goblins with militia and a priest searching the crypt for a cursed sword. 


FYI, we are playing in-person in Toronto, so if you're interested in joining, let me know!


Here's how it went: 


Hearing rumours of treasure in the swamp of Illmire, the group decides to leave their peasant lives behind, gather what meager possession they can, and spend the last of their silver travelling to the little-known region. 

While still outside the swamp, the group investigates a burial mound rumored to hold a banished king of the Rackoo clan, who once populated Illmire. Legend says this king took to the dark arts and was laid to rest with his powerful sword outside of his Clan's area. 

Finding a tree next to a well and a rope leading down, most of the group decides to go descend, except for the eldest of three brothers, Bill, and two others. Suddenly, they are attacked by giant spiders lurking in the tree, and killed while others climb back up the well to help, eventually defeating the spiders.

Back down the well, Conner and Stanley bury their brother Bill. Bosco, starts searching a shelf for beer, and discovers a hidden door behind it! The group goes through to find a small group of militia drinking and saying something about a cult, but they can't make out more details before going back through the secret entrance to avoid being seen. 

Conner recalls that a cult killed his parents, so he decides to risk contact with the militia to find out more. He claims to be alone, but the militia's leader, Hogor, quickly orders a search of nearby rooms and the group is discovered. After some tense moments, the two sides decide not to fight, and sit down for drinks to discuss how they can help each other. 

Two more people, Yasha, a priestess from temple of the Luminol Star in Illmire, and her bodyguard, Jahlin, enter, and explain that they have enlisted the help of the militia to find the cursed sword buried here and take it back to the temple, where it will be safe from falling into the wrong hands, and destroyed if possible. She admits that they are having trouble proceeding, and believe there to be a secret entrance somewhere hiding the true crypt. 

Hogor offers the group spots in the militia if the can help find the entrance and retrieve the sword. Without much difficulty, the group located a trap door hidden beneath sacks of old rations. The wooden door is decorated with a carved racoon face, the mouth slightly protruding from the otherwise flat floor. Joo tries prying the door open by inserting his crowbar in the racoon mouth, but it suddenly animates and spits out the piece of iron! This gives Joo an idea, and he puts a small piece of food from his rations into the racoon mouth - it again animates, eats the ration, and the door opens!

The group climbs down the ladder and finds two rooms - one with a barred double door decorated again with a racoon face, and another room with an alter, silver racoon statue, and plate. The group offers a few coins and incense to the shrine and a ethereal racoon takes place, offering to answer one question about the burial mound. The group asks how to retrieve the sword, and the spirit tells them it must be taken from the bearer in the next room, but to beware of him and his minions. 
The group convinces the militia to un-barr the door, which releases a huge claw trap from the ceiling which they all manage to avoid. The door opens and they see the remains of the fallen Rackoo king lumbering toward them wielding a two-handed sword with a charcoal-black blade, followed by six skeletons. Shrikant thinks quickly to use his spell and causes the air around the undead to become thick and difficult for the them to move through. The militia form a wall blocking their exit, and a second line attacks with their spears, quickly dispatching the undead king and his skeletons. 

The group searches the room and find a silver crown and coins. Yasha cautions anyone against touching the evil king's crown and sword, and orders the militia to wrap them carefully so that she can take them to her temple. 

Hogor tells the group that he is impressed with their abilities, and invites them back to the militia's headquarters in the Old Watchtower to be initiated. ",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fabb0e0>,osr,1635356730.0
death in space play report pt. 2," 

The Frymobile is actually quite spacious: there’s normal spaceship things like a bridge, life support, bedding, and a meeting room, but there’s also a meat locker and a greenhouse towards the back of the ship… along with an airlock which will be important later.

The ship takes off while Sakura once again argues with Marshal about the hygiene of chewing ice instead of drinking water. Sakura is even more dumbfounded as Marshal and Lovi refer to water and water vapor as “liquid ice” and “gaseous ice,” declaring to herself “I’m on a ship of fools. Mostly fools.”

The newly formed party decides to set the ship on course to the nearby planet Durf, but they run into two obstacles: one, the ship doesn’t have the capacity to bridge (in other words it can’t use hyperspeed travel), and two, the ship is unarmed.

As the ship exits the atmosphere, Marshal quickly veers the Frymobile out of the way of two metallic spheres each the size of a car, which turn on their red singular robotic eyes to look at the ship but otherwise do nothing. Marshal takes the controls from Lovi after this incident and locks himself in the control room.

As the party starts their trip, they realize just how long it will take to get to Durf: it’ll take at least two weeks barring stops. They rolled the minimum time, but it’s still a lot of time in space.

The party rests until the ship slows to a screeching halt. Confused, the party looks out the reinforced bay windows to see another similarly designed black shuttle to the right of the ship. Initially Jo and Lovi volunteer to investigate the parked ship in spacesuits while Marshal and Sakura stay aboard the Frymobile.

The party opens up the hatch and finds a horrific sight within the ship: held in cryogenic tanks inside this ship are perfect clones of the party. They wear white jumpsuits and appear to be sleeping inside the tanks. Jo uses her transceiver Cosmic Mutation to contact the people inside the Frymobile, but is intentionally vague about the situation, only saying “something weird is on this ship.”

As Lovi and Jo attempt to enter the ship, Jo trips on a wire. Without an electrical charge, the clone of Jo’s tank opens and the unprotected clone floats out into space, bumping into the windshield of the Frymobile and transforming Sakura’s face into a pale so pale that she might as well have seen a ghost. Whatever pulse that clone may have had is gone now. Marshal somehow doesn’t notice the clone hit his windshield and Sakura says nothing about it.

Jo and Lovi raid the ship to find the pilots are long-dead skeletons, and manage to grab a couple audio files and about 32 holos overall. On the way out, Lovi trips on another wire and Sakura’s clone floats out into open space.

After trying to deny what just happened to Marshal, Sakura reluctantly explains the situation. Marshal justifiably wants to take a look, so he grabs the spare spacesuit and tries to yank Lovi back to the ship using the wire that connects him to the ship.

On a failed dexterity attempt, Marshal disconnects the wire from Lovi. That was Lovi’s life support.

Lovi frantically tries to get his magnetic boots off of the ship and succeeds in that. Marshal tries to grab him and misses again.

When it seems like Lovi might suffocate in space, Jo grabs him and manages to pull him back onto the Frymobile as the last of his oxygen runs out.

A couple slow minutes later, Lovi awakens alive on the ship. But he isn’t the same: he had a near-death experience watching the end of the universe, and now he has a Cosmic Mutation of his own…",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fa0b2c0>,osr,1678652586.0

**DND Notes** **Opening Narration:**

You are from the tiny village of Myr, nestled in the northern tip of the great Rieuwood. It is unlikely that you have ever traveled further than the next nearest village of Gulluvia. Living out your days helping your family's farm, as a woodcutter in the aforementioned Rieuwood, or as one of the few artisans who assist the rest of the village.

On the day of the dove, during the Harvest moon, Tinner, The trader for your small village has come stumbling through the tree-line. His face is covered in blood and dirt, his tunic in tatters. He is cradling something in his arms, that you can't see. As he reaches the center of the village a crowd begins forming around him.

As you approach the commotion, a woman lets out a sharp gasp and faints into the arms of the nearby baker. Pushing past a group of youths, you finally lay eyes on what Tinner is holding. You can't quite grasp what you're looking at until a village elder whispers in a low rasping voice, “Gold.” 8 oddly shaped circular pieces of tarnished metal fill Tinner's hands.

In your village 8 pieces of gold could feed a family for years. The village turns itself over in excitement  hellbent on acquiring more. Tinner has promised to lead a small expedition to the location of where he found this treasure.

You have been chosen (Or volunteered) by your family to represent them in this expedition. The village has pooled all their resources and has given you all the equipment that they can, to get you started on your journey and keep you safe.

**Day Zero – Notes**

Party Composition:

**Tropheluss** –  Human. The town runner. He delivered letters and goods from home to home. Worked as Tinner's apprentice. He is capable of casting Translocation magic and has a strong sense of adventure. He is also the party's Mapper, in charge of dungeon maps and interesting locations.

**Tuffs –** Dwelf. The Village groundskeeper/gravedigger. They dream of becoming a great cook and is good friends with Reed the baker. They have a gambeson and a sword. Tuffs is the party Campmaster, in charge of setting watches and campfire connections.

**Lorenza –**  Human. Village councilman. Has stated everyone in the village knows who he is. Has brigandine armor and carries a spear. Lorenza is the party Scout, traveling ahead of the party as they travel.

**Bael –** Dark Elf. Iona's Brother. Worked on the family farm. The farmhouse burnt down a few months ago, killing both of his parents. Has brigandine armor and carries a 2-handed axe. Bael is the party deputy, in charge of hirelings.

**Iona –** Dark Elf. Bael's Sister. An aspiring necromancer, who performed the burial rites for her parents, who perished in a fire some months back. She also has a pet goat named mono. Iona is the party's stockman, keeping track of any equipment not being carried by a party member.

**Tinner –** **NPC** Human. Village trader. Agreed to take the party to the location where he found the gold. He drives a goat led cart that holds the parties gear. Has leather armor and a sword.

**Goken – NPC** Human. Criminal. Arrested by Tuffs for grave-robbing. The village has sentenced him to work as the parties hireling until he has earned the party 100 copper. Owns a sword, but is currently disarmed and handcuffed to Bael.

**Day 1 – Hawk**

A cold, cloudy, and nippy day. Autumn is in full swing. The crops have been harvested, the leaves are changing, and the winter winds are starting to blow in. The Party leave the village traveling west down a trail, led by Tinner. They meet a group of teenagers high on drugs along the trail, staring at the clouds above. Lorenza accosts the youths for being no good stoners. Bael teaches the teenagers the “Hang ten” Surfer sign, which blows all of their minds. This hand sign becomes a party signal in the affirmative. Bael and Tuffs are given drugs for being cool with the youths. One of the teenagers tells anyone in the party who talks to him about what day he thinks they were born on. The days of the month are called by a different animal. It is believed by some, that people take on the traits of the animal they were born on.  Bael and Tuffs are squirrels, Lorenza is a fox, and Iona is a skunk. Tropheluss was not told his animal.

Later Goken requests to be uncuffed from Bael – promises he'll stick around till he pays the group back. Bael says nothing to Goken.

Campfire Connection – Tropheluss and Iona talk about Mono the goat, Iona's Necromancy, Tropheluss' Translocation, reading books on magic, and other various bits.

**Day 2 - Falcon**

Another Cold and nippy day. The Party encounter a fork in the road, with a signpost that reads: ""South to Gulluvia, west to Liwil, east to Myr."" At the base of the signpost is  “Brock” the severely homeless beggar with a tin cup, asking for money.  Tinner states that their destination lies to the west. Lorenza immediately departs west. Bael notices that Goken is getting jittery the longer they stay at the crossroad. Tuffs gives the beggar the drugs they got from the teenagers the previous day.

Campfire Connections – Tuffs asks Bael about what he will do if they get rich and also asks why Bael is so quiet all the time. Bael says his/Iona's parents died in a house fire 6 months ago and he doesn't talk to people as much, because words/rumors spread too quickly. Bael asks about Tuffs arresting of Goken. Tuffs was the groundskeeper/gravedigger of Myr. They found Goken stuck inside the village burial mound a few nights ago, trying to rob it. Goken states that his cousin died recently and that he was just trying to get the 100 copper that his cousin owed him.

Bael eventually confides to Tuffs that he knows his parent's remains were removed from the burial mound the night after their burial ceremony. Tuffs and Bael both don't know what happened to the bones, but Bael has been keeping this a secret from Iona. Iona is a necromancer, and thus is the one who performed the burial rites for her parents.

Goken tells Bael in confidence that his \[dead\] cousin told him where they can find a ton of treasure. If Bael lets Goken free, Goken will tell the party where to find the treasure. Everyone is rather confused by these statements and choose to simply ignore Goken.

Lorenza questions Tinner about where he is taking the party. Tinner confides in Lorenza that he was hired to take another party to a cliff side. This party excavated a hole in the rock and went inside searching for loot. After two days no one came out, he went in to look for them. Just inside the opening, Tinner saw one of the party members dead on the ground and 8 gold pieces. He did not stop to check if the man was alive, he just grabbed the 8 gold and ran away. Tinner advises Lorenza at this time, that Lorenza should think of naming his spear. That any traveler “worth their salt” names their weapon. Tinner says his swords name is “Talon” and he used to own a dagger called “beak” but has since lost it. Lorenza says he will need to think on this.

Goken and Bael come to an arrangement. Goken will be freed from his shackles, but Bael will hold onto Goken's sword “Palehell.” Bael states that Goken is free to leave the party after he pays back the 100 copper that he owes the village.

**Day 3- Dog**

Heavy rain and mud slows the group down considerably. The party finds an altar along the road to the nature God Sylvanus. Etched into the large oak tree are 3 faces, one old man, an adult woman, and a small child of no gender. The god is always represented as all 3. People leave handmade natural offerings such as leaf crowns and wicker baskets, worshiping the God for good harvests and growth. The party camps under the tree.

Campfire Connection: Everyone questions Bael on why he chose to release Goken. Bael states that he trusts Goken enough to release him from his handcuffs and states that they have come to an arrangement on Goken's service to the party. Goken gives the hang ten sign reaffirming his commitment to the party.

**Day 4- Skunk**

Light drizzles and muggy weather. The Party travel much farther on this day than previously.  As the sun sets, a bounty hunter on horseback approaches Lorenza and shows him a wanted poster for Goken. The bounty hunter states he will offer anyone 10 copper for information leading to the arrest of Goken. Lorenza points the BH in the direction of the Party a couple hundred yards back.

As the Bounty Hunter approaches the party, Goken recognizes him and runs into the woods. The BH shows the party the poster and offers the 10 copper. Iona then tells the Bounty Hunter that Goken ran into the woods. The Bounty Hunter enters the woods and comes back shortly with Goken tied up and being dragged along the ground. The Hunter gives Iona 10 copper. The party start to regret giving up Goken and asks the bounty hunter how much the bounty is. The Hunter says that Goken is worth 50 copper. Bael gives the Bounty Hunter 5 \[fake\] gems to release Goken and give up the bounty. The Bounty Hunter agrees to this arrangement. Bael lets slip that the party is on an expedition to recover more gems and gold. The BH takes the 5 gems, releases Goken, and offers his services to the rest of the party when he learns they are going after more treasure. He is rebuked by the party, but states he will be in Liwil if they change their mind. He then rides off.

The party accosts Goken, and shave his head to make him look different than his wanted poster. Goken reveals that he owes some people 80 copper in Gulluvia for gambling debts. This means he is currently in debt 100 copper to Myr and 80 to Gulluvia. The party ask if he is wanted anywhere else, to which he affirms he is not.

Campfire Connection – Lorenza connects with Tinner to find out more about Reed the Baker, who lives in Myr. However, Tinner knows nothing about him as the very rarely is in the village. Lorenza and Tuffs have a conversation about Reed the baker and try to learn more about Reed's family.

The Party talk about all the gear that they have, as they have not taken stock of what each party member is carrying. They determine that they have 2 bear traps, 2 tents, and some other odds and ends. The Party consider taking a downtime day from traveling to hunt in the woods. They started the expedition with 50 rations and are down to 22.

**Day 5- Worm**

A cloudy, humid, muggy day.  The Party encounter a cheese monger by the name of Minerva. Excited to increase their rations they happily do some trading. A harmonica, tinderbox, and 10 copper are traded for 11 small wheels of goat cheese and spicy cheese. Tuffs advises Minerva to see Reed in Myr and tell him that Tuffs sent her. As Minerva departs, she starts playing the harmonica and waving to the party.

Campfire Connection – Tuffs talks to Lorenza about Minerva the cheese monger. Tuffs asks if Lorenza was scared of  leaving the village. Lorenza confesses that he never felt like he was really part of the village. Says things can seem one way in the village, but really be another. Lorenza asks Tuffs if they think Tinner can be trusted, Tuffs thinks that he can.

**Day 6 – Butterfly**

Another humid, muggy, unseasonably warm autumn day. Lorenza comes to another fork in the road. Standing in the road are two men pointing rapiers at each other. One man is wearing a very long white flowing headband, the other is wearing very nice looking clothing. They begin a duel and the man wearing the headband, eventually prevails stabbing the other through the heart. Lorenza quickly backtracks to the party before being seen, telling them what he just saw. When the party reaches the fork, the white head-banded man is gone and the body of the slain man has been placed in a position of repose underneath the Cross-roads signpost. The sign post reads: West to Fourtower, North to Liwil, East to Gulluvia. Iona searches the dead man, his rapier is gone, but she finds a quill, inkpot, and a sealed letter. She takes all the items and does not open the letter. The party get antsy about standing around a dead body and decide to camp in the woods south of the cross-roads.

Campfire Connection – The party wonder if they should bury the body. Tinner states that a group called the Basilik knights patrol the area around Liwil and should be able to take care of it for them. Considering the party has no means of actually burying him.

The group turn to Iona to ask what is involved in burying someone. Iona states that the 3 steps to burying someone are as follows: The individual performing the rites must perform a dance around the body, a goat is to pee on the body, and then the body is buried in the ground. When asked why a goat has to pee on the body, Iona states that goats are holy and it purifies the body, helping release the soul. It also draws worms to the body, speeding up the process of decomposing the corpse.

Tuffs confides in Iona privately that her parents bodies were removed from their burial site (but no one knows by whom) and that Bael has been keeping this a secret from her. Tuffs asks Iona if she might have accidentally resurrected her parents during the rites. Iona is unsure, but is shocked and angry about this revelation. She doesn't want to talk to Bael about it at this time.

**Day 7 – Mouse**

A hot humid day. The party wake up to two Basilisk knights inspecting the dead body under the sign post. Tinner states that someone should go talk to them, before they are spotted, so they don't look suspicious. Lorenza volunteers and approaches the knights. He recalls to the knights the duel of the previous day.

The knights confer with each other and then advise Lorenza that what he witnessed was a duel of a “banded swordsman.” There are two such people in all of the region. A banded swordsman is marked by the long head-band they wear. It is a status symbol that shows they are either the greatest or second greatest swordsman in all the region. A banded swordsman cannot turn down a duel for their headband. While these duels are technically legal – any person may gamble their life in a fair and honest fight, it has been causing problems whenever one of these individuals shows up in a town. As people come from all around to challenge this fighter for fame and glory, and the bodies start piling up. They state that this swordsman's name is Everild and he should be very cautious should he see him.

The party then depart west towards Fourtower. When getting close to the village, Tinner states that the party should try to draw as little attention to themselves as possible, as they don't want to paint a target on their back or give anymore information away about their expedition.

**The party immediately do the exact opposite of what Tinner asks, as follows**:

**Lorenza**\- Entering the Moorland Magpie Inn, Lorenza sees the Banded Swordsman (2nd rank), Everild, sitting by the fireplace drinking ale. He is carrying both his rapier and the rapier of the dead man. Lorenza strikes up a conversation with Everild, stating he does not wish to duel him. Everild buys him a few beers. Lorenza finds out that Everild never meant to become banded and did so by accident. While a teenager, Everild got drunk at an inn and insulted a man. The man challenged Everild to a duel, in which Everild won. He then found out the man was banded and the title was thrust onto him. He has since killed 3 people defending his life and title, the last being the man he killed yesterday. He says he isn't proud of what he's done, but is powerless against it now, as he cannot simply give up the title. After a brief pause, Lorenza asks Everild if his rapier has a name. Everild states that his rapier indeed has a name, “The Lost Soul.”

\*\*Tuffs -\*\*Entering the Moorland Magpie Inn, Tuffs notices two merchants arguing loudly over which cheese is better, Spicy or Goat. Tuffs buys the men a bottle of wine which they state will pair well with the cheeses. The men try the wine and cheese together, coming to the conclusion that Goat is indeed the better cheese. Having settled the debate, The two merchants named Harold and Gord pay Tuffs for the wine and then offer them a seat. All 3 start a wine and cheese club where they get loudly drunk and eat a shit ton of cheese.

**Bael**  \- Goes to Cleric Madjken's House of the Morning Sky. A temple dedicated to the Sun, which she worships like a God. Bael asks Madjken about some old ruins on the south side of the village. Madjken states the ruins are an old sunken watchtower from the days of the Nightingale war between Queen Ehlissa and the Lich Acererak. She states that she would actually like for someone to go down and clear out the old watchtower, so that she may cleanse and purify it of evils past. However, she is too old now and her party has no desire to go down there. She offers Bael a gold piece to each of his party members, should they go down into the ruins and clear it out. Bringing back an artifact of Queen Ehlissa's as proof. Madjken also advises Bael of the principles and tenets of the Morning Sky and states that should he meditate for a week, naked and alone, in the light of the morning sky and be blessed by its rays, he will be immune to all diseases and may even be able to call upon its light.

**Tropheluss and Iona –** Knocking on the door to Bal's Grammarye, the door creaks open. Entering the room, Tropheluss lights a lantern. The room is almost completely empty, save for a well made bed, a writing desk with a note that says, “Gone a reading.”, and a very large chest at the foot of the bed. Opening the chest, the pair realize that the chest goes down into a another chamber. A large circular room. Tropheluss draws his personal sigil above the door to Bal's Grammarye. With Iona's help, they tie a makeshift rope of sheets and blankets and toss it down the chests opening.

Scaling down, Tropheluss' feet touch the worked stone floor of the chamber. As they do, he is assaulted by a constant and deafening ringing of a gong. He is unable to hear Iona calling down to him from above. Taking the lantern he ventures further into the underground structure. Iona begins pacing frantically with her goat mono inside the bedroom, as the lantern light disappears from view.

Searching the lair Tropheluss finds a jail cell with a dead body that he cannot reach. As well as a room with blue feminine statue, a chrome dagger in one hand, and a severed head held by the hair in the other. Approaching to inspect the statue further, the head swings out at Tropheluss biting and tearing off a piece of his cheek. With blood spilling down his chin and neck, Tropheluss makes a hasty retreat.

Drawing his sigil on a doorway inside the underground lair, he casts the spell “Portal” Connecting the two doors. Traveling through the door he finds himself standing on Fourtower bridge, just outside Bal's Grammarye. His sigils dissolve from above the doorways. Iona, seeing Tropheluss, grabs him from behind, spinning him around and seeing his terrible wound. She rips part of the makeshift sheet rope and bandages his face. The pair both notice that Athalgrim, the warrior and guardian of Fourtower bridge has been staring at them from a second story window in one of Fourtower bridge's...well...towers. They both run from the bridge back toward the Moorland Magpie.

There was a post here that I responded to recently. It was very straight forward, and it was simply “[Tell me about your campaign](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/1006jbh/tell_me_about_your_campaign/)”. In contrast to the post, my [response](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/1006jbh/tell_me_about_your_campaign/j2fyh42/) was a bit of a read, at least compared to what I normally see on Reddit. Well, even though my comment was rather hefty, it still leaves out a lot of information, and, more importantly, it got me thinking that I might benefit from maintaining an ongoing journal of the campaign’s sessions. Of course, I have many notes, so what I really mean by journal is a “pretty” version that is fun to read. This “Entry Zero” covers everything that went into the game before it actually started. It sets the stage with all the context for how I am running the game, what I’m using, and what my plan was for the start.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fa47bf0>,osr,1672948990.0
Lyric Sands: Vaarn play report 1,"Hello allHere is a report from my first game of Vaarn. I use [https://perchance.org/travelinvaarn](https://perchance.org/travelinvaarn) to generate travel days (some copy taken from it), and the dice drop from the zines for the larger point crawl. Map forthcoming in a future post. Italics are verbatim from my intro to the session - apologies to all fans of brevity for my homage to the styles of book of the new sun & caves of qud. This is the our first OSE style game and it has been an absolute blast so far.

Cast: Mockbridge - a mycomorph with the visage of a nun; Lask - a mutant clone dedicated to the cult of the dead titan HYPERION; Dolor Est, synth of the torturer's guild; Typhon - a New-Axolotl with a fondness for drugs; Darling - a cacklemaw of surprising friendliness.

*You wake wishing you had never been born. Several weeks now have been spent in the guts of a prison transport as it collects its ill-fortuned cargo to face their fate someday soon in the capital of Hegemon. So far you have been granted the gift of only half dying of thirst as the transport rattles along the Vaarnish desert. Your cell dispenses meagre rations as a part of its automatic functions. The irregular trot of the transport's mostly functional locomotion has been a kind of friend to you. Certainly more dependable than the disembodied voices of your fellow prisoner, fettered by guilts you can only guess at.* 

*But at some point in the night the rumbling stopped.* 

*Then by late day the winking lights of your cell stopped their winking.* 

*By this time thirst had replaced your cowardice and you tentatively pushed the cell door open. Without power, the cell charitably swings open.*

*You and your fellow prisoners scavenged the transport for what vittle you could find, about three days’ worth each. After, of course some only mildly rash thirst slaking that is. Alongside these rations you found the items you were captured with, and some others you weren’t.* 

*Your once-home looks from the outside like nothing so much as the mosquitoid shape of a giant stinging insect with rumbling tracks for feet. Its plasteel carapace flashing blackly under the sun. In place of translucent wings, the many fins and sails of the ersatz creature are zagged by what you have been assured is camouflage for the blue desert against the red sun. Its lines force you to fondly recollect your last migraine.*

*Now as the sun sets on your new dusk of freedom, the heaping task of free-will is upon you once again.* 

*What do you do?*

The group make their claims: travel by day! Travel by night! But as dusk falls the weary do too. Only the slip of shade that is Dolor Est keeps watch, clicking all the while. 

In the deep of night the group is set on by a troupe of yurlings, hoping to scour the silent machinery under which the group sleeps. The fungal-monkeys get a couple of swipes in before Darling fucking demolishes them and slurps one down for good measure. At least the Hyena-kin need not bother for rations that night. 

The first day of travel dawns, the group pray for rain, but know they will be disappointed. In the morning they encounter 4 Faa nomads. The nomads travel by skiff, alongside their healthy Yurlings. Their mood is warlike. They have surplus water and want revenge on other Faa nomads who stole their livestock. The Faa follow the Pale Faith of Amun-Oh.

Uninterested, Typhon reaches out across the distance both real and numinous to set blood afire, turning two yurlings inside out and blasting their own mind into unconsciousness. The nomads round on the group, bearing weapons, their Pale Faith dispensed with for the moment. 

Mockbridge stands alone on what passes for a road, summoning a fuligin bolt from the blue, blinding two of the Faa in the process. This tips the balance, and soon the sortie is closed. The ledger stands thus: all but one of the Faa are dead, the survivor a psychic thrall to Mockbridge’s delicious and mind-slaving flesh. The skiff is spoil, as is the surplus water it carried in its bowls and a parasitic shotgun that Typhon has claimed. As dusk approaches there is some solace in the fact that the owl of wisdom flies only at night, and the consequence of today’s adventure is sure to come on swift wings.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11faba7e0>,osr,1648723974.0
Session Four Part One - Lohilan - A Knave Hack Actual Play Report,"**Part 1 of Session 4 of the Lohilan Campaign!**  
 

 **My apologies for how long it is taking to get this session complete. We met over Labor Day weekend and played for about 9 hours! On top of that, I am recovering from surgery. It has taken me a long time to get a decent summary together. I've decided, instead of trying to post the ENTIRE session in one go. I will post this session in two parts. Below is part one of Session 4! Hopefully I will have part 2 posted later this week.**   
 

 **This session contains spoilers for Tomb of the Serpent King!**   
 

 **Day 9 Cat – Noon (Sunny Clear Day)**   
  We begin the session with the entire party readying Bren's goat cart to head out to Tinner's Treasure location. They have all arrived at the designated noon meeting time. Tinner has also loaded his cart with any items that were overflowing from the party's cart to help them setup camp. Emery arrives looking ready to adventure. He has brought his own rations for four days, a shovel, and 4 hours of lantern oil. Maban di Morton has come much less prepared carrying a small flask, a small fishing net, 5 candles, and a single bell.   
  

**Mid-day while traveling** and rounding the bend on a large hill, the party scout **Lorenza** is “ambushed” by five large pig-faced men leaning on large two handed axes. The leader of the Pigmen takes a few steps forward and addresses Lorenza in a low gnarling, snorting voice, “You see any guys about this tall.” Gesturing with his hand about 3 feet off the ground. “Got flat faces, tiny hooked noses.” Lorenza says this doesn't ring a bell. The Pigman asks where Lorenza is coming from and Lorenza responds, Fourtower. The Pigmen seem to generally only be interested in meat and small men who hang out in trees and taste like chicken. They ask if Lorenza has anything else to trade, but they can't seem to come to any deals. The rest of the party arrive shortly thereafter. The piggmen offer to make camp and spend the night eating and drinking with the party. However, upon finding out that the Piggmen eat other little people, they quickly but respectfully decline and state that they are going to keep traveling. The two groups then depart in opposite directions.   
  

As the sun sets, the party encounter 3 deer along the edge of a natural treeline. None of the party members carry ranged weapons to hunt them. Tropheluss however, uses his maleficence (A spell can be expended to perform a magical attack that has a unique descriptor to that character) to fell the deer. Tropheluss' maleficence manifests in the form of force energy. Using his force attack, he propels his dagger with frightening speed, felling one of the deer as the other two flee. The party make camp, eating the deer Tropheluss killed for dinner.   
  

**Campfire Connection:** Tuffs asks Emery about his story. Emery advises Tuffs that his son Kellan was a traveler, who was taken on an expedition and never returned. He has since vowed to travel with parties and make sure that no other sons are lost on their travels. Emery believes him to be killed by fire elementals. Emery has a rectangular box shape burn in box of his hands. He states that he possesses a box to the plane of fire and that he has made a deal to destroy the box, should the fire elementals he was dealing with go back to their home plane. As the elementals were forced into Emery and Tuff's world by humans that thought they could control fire and were very wrong.   
 

 **Day 10 Swan – Sunny but chilly**   
 

 **About mid-day, Cresting a small hill**, Lorenza spots a pack of wolves on the other side, five strong and just 40 feet away. He quickly moves back down the hill the way he came and signals his party to come closer. The party approach and ask what is going on. Lorenza explains there are 7 wolves on the other side of the hill. A howl bounces off of the nearby hills, as the pack of wolves round the hill to engage the party. The party tells Tinner, Maban, and Emery to flee with the carts. Tinner attempts to take off with his cart when the wolves charge.   
  

**COMBAT ROUND ONE** 

**3 wolves charge Tinner, Maban (pounces 2 damage), and Emery. 1 wolf charges Tropheluss (2 damage) and the final wolf attacks Lorenza (no damage).**   


 **Lorenza – Stab the wolf that bit him** 

**Tuffs – Attacks with Phil the quarterstaff** 

**Tropheluss – Assists Tuffs with attacking the wolf** 

**Iona – Runs towards cart and casts Death Ray on the wolf on Tinner** 

**Bael – Rushes to assist the wolf that pounced on Maban** 

**Emery- hammering his wolf** 

**Tinner – attacking wolf that's attacking him.**   


  **Combat Narration:**   The first wolf rushes upon Lorenza snapping its jaws at him, however Lorenza is quicker, his spear pierces the beast through the top of the skull killing it instantly. The second wolf snaps at Tropheluss attempting to get his thick juicy calves. Tuffs turns towards the wolf biting Tropheluss and with a mighty swing of their quaterstaff Phil, destroys the jaw of the wolf sending teeth flying. The third wolf pounces Maban nipping and biting her arms. Bael rushes in and with one fell swoop beheads the wolf pestering Maban. The fourth wolf snaps at Tinner up in the seat of his cart. Iona turns towards the wolf and begins making various hand gestures (Ala Doctor Strange) as the red gem in her circlet glows, a thin red light pierces the wolf killing it instantly (death ray.) Emery raising his hammer, bonks an almighty bonk on the final wolf, killing it with ease.   
 

 **END OF COMBAT**   
  

The party, now surrounded by dead wolves and a bit startled, take stock of their situation. They decide that it would be better to stop early for the day and harvest what they can from the wolves. They are able to get 12 rations and  4 wolf pelts.   
  

**Campfire Connection:**   **Iona to Maban –** Maban immediately asks Iona if them getting attacked by wolves is going to happen a lot and if she was supposed to do something during the fight. She states that she can yell really loud. Iona says that attacks don't happen a lot, but that she should get used to them. Iona says that is totally OK for Maban to run and hide if she gets in trouble.   
 

 **Iona to Tropheluss –** Iona gives Tropheluss the worn golden key with his sigil on it, that she got from the dead duelist's letter. Tropheluss examines the key and has no idea what it is or how his sigil got on it. He recognizes it as his own handwriting and knows he put the sigil on the key, but has no recollection of doing so. Maban, who is still loitering, points to the key and says that it is magical.  Iona thinks they should go to Gulluvia and seek out the duelist's lover to get more answers. Tropheluss holds onto the key.   
 

 **Day 11  Mole – Sunny but chilly**   
   

The party have just a short distance to travel to Tinner's treasure location. Set in a beautiful verdant vale between two mountains (https://imgur.com/a/EcdQOxd). However, while hiking the last few miles, storm clouds roll in as the weather turns gusty, rainy, and cold. The party arrive at their destination and Tinner immediately starts unpacking his things as quick as he can. He seems quite ready to leave, having just arrived. When questioned about this, he says he never planned to stay more than exactly necessary to show them the location and leave. Tinner motions to where the entrance to this treasure was found.     
  

When the party move forward to take a better look they see a large boulder that has been split down the middle with mining supplies. The mining supplies have been set aside and have rusted over from the elements. There is a large hole in the side of one mountain, no longer being blocked by the boulder that two people could fit into side by side.     
 

 DUNGEON DIVE – HOUR ONE – TURN ONE   
 

 **Hallway 1 Description: (Imgur:** [**https://imgur.com/a/fnVAyqG**](https://imgur.com/a/fnVAyqG)) The hole in the side of the mountain connects to a corridor that is 8 feet wide and tall. The corridor has been cut from the rock of the mountain and shaped by man. It is musty, cool, and damp inside. The corridor continues far down to a wall with a stone bar set in metal holders. There are 4 entryways, 2 on either side of the corridor, about halfway down. Each of the entryways leads to an identical rectangular room with a large stone container inside.   
  

**Bael and Lorenza** enter the hole at the same time. Lorenza carrying a lantern for light. As they enter, Lorenza must avoid a dead body lying face down, covered in crawling with rotgrubs and flies. Using his spear, Lorenza rolls the body over onto his side and against the wall. There is a rusted bloody dagger in the man's abdomen. Bael reaches down and with a flash, yanks the dagger from the dead man, as grubs squirm outward and attempt to latch onto bael's hand. The rotgrubs having failed, go back to eating the dead man. The bronze dagger has a blade like a bird's beak. It is rusted from blood and in need of repair. The pair move forward towards the first set of entryways.   
  

**DUNGEON DIVE – HOUR ONE – TURN TWO**   


  **Bael and Lorenza –** Looking into the two entryways, they see identical rectangular rooms with very large stone containers. Bael enters the first room on the North side and finds a stone container with its lid partially opened.     
  On the floor of the room are two more dead bodies. One body has been decayed to the bone from the top of the head, down to the shoulders. His hands are around his neck in the universal sign of choking. The other body is sprawled on his back in the entryway, and has been decayed/eaten completely to the bone. Lorenza enters to give Bael more light as Bael decides to search the container.   
  Inside the container, Bael finds a clay statue of a snake-man warrior. The statue has been smashed with a large rock. Inside the destroyed statue is the skeleton of a small snake.   
 

 **Iona, Maban, and Tropheluss** enter the corridor next. Maban is holding a lantern in one hand, and grabbing Iona's tunic tightly with the other. They skirt passed the dead body and go further down the hall to catch up with Bael and Lorenza. They fill the corridor around the entryways and discuss who is going to check out the room that Bael and Lorenza didn't enter.   
 

 **Tuffs** enters the corridor and quickly moves up to the rest of the group, deciding to take the initiative and enter the first room on the South side. Using Phillium the quarterstaff, they stand as far back as they can and shove the lid of the container open. It slowly scrapes open, revealing an unbroken clay statue of a snake man warrior. The body of the statue is that of a human, but has the head of a large cobra.   
 

 **Emery** guards the entrance.   
  

**DUNGEON DIVE – HOUR ONE – TURN THREE**   


  **Lorenza** getting impatient that the searching is taking too long, walks further down the hall, his lantern reveals a cracked wall with a large stone slab set into metal holders in the wall. (image provided to party: [https://imgur.com/a/rRJtLcU](https://imgur.com/a/rRJtLcU))   


  **Maban** is instructed to stand in the corridor and provide light to those who want to search the two rooms currently being occupied.   


  **Bael** kneels down searching the two corpses in the room he is currently in. He finds a small clay snake idol with peridot earrings.   


  **Iona** enters the South room that Tuffs opened the container in. They search for any kind of inscription or drawings on the walls, but is unable to find any information of value.   


  **Tuffs** leaves the room the and heads to the next set of entryways. However, both lanterns are too far away to search either of the next set of rooms.   


  **Tropheluss** grabs the large rock from the smashed snake man statue. He takes it into the room that Iona is actively searching and with all his might smashes the clay warrior statue.     


  A large cloud of  dark green smokes billows out from the destroyed clay statue. Iona whirls around and quickly dives out of the room, evading any of the poisonous gas. Tropheluss however, takes the entire cloud of smoke directly to the face, stumbling back as he coughs and chokes on the gas cloud (8 poison damage.) He is somehow miraculously not killed outright by this and is able to catch his breath as the cloud dissipates.      


  **DUNGEON DIVE HOUR ONE TURN FOUR**   


  **Tropheluss** after catching his breath, quickly leaves the dungeon to gather writing supplies, so that he can create a magic sigil. **Emery** follows behind to make sure Tropheluss doesn't collapse outside by himself.   


  **Iona** curses at Tropheluss as he walks by her. She stands up, dusting herself off and heads back into the room to search the now destroyed warrior statue.   


  **Tuffs** seeing Tropheluss flea the dungeon, runs back to Iona and asks what the hell is going on. Iona explains that Tropheluss in his haste, set off a trap. And that anyone who smashes a clay statue is going to be met with a cloud of poison gas. Iona advises against smashing the clay statues. Tuffs then assists Iona in searching the stone container. Together they find two oval shaped gold pieces.   
  

**Bael** leaves the northern room he's been searching and takes up Emery's guard duties, watching Iona search the stone container in the other room.   
 

 **Lorenza,** realizing that the party isn't coming to him any faster, moves back towards the pair of rooms that hasn't been searched yet. He enters the second Northern room. Using the butt-end of his spear, he forces the lid of the container open. He finds a clay statue of a thin and sly looking snake man scholar wearing robes and holding scrolls.   
  

**DUNGEON DIVE HOUR ONE TURN FIVE**   
  

**Tropheluss** reenters the dungeon carrying a quill and ink pot. He begins inscribing  his personal sigil on his arm, casting the spell *Transmit Breath* (This spells basically fills Tropheluss' lungs with air, without having to breath. Protecting him from all airborne threats...)     
 

 **Lorenza** steps back out into the hallway as he sees Tropheluss coming back into the dungeon. Exasperated he shouts, “Why are you coming back in from there?! Man, it takes this party forever to do anything!”     


  **The Party** meet back up in the middle of the corridor. They all begin discussing their next steps and whether or not they should keep looting these stone tombs. Lorenza argues the party is moving too damn slow and wants to continue further in. Bael says Lorenza is being impatient and thinks that Tropheluss should smash anymore statues they find. Maban examines Tropheluss, letting him know he inhaled an asphyxiation gas and he should warn anyone if he has trouble breathing.     


  **Lorenza** moves back to the stone slab and begins examining it in more detail. He determines that the wall behind the slab is somewhat brittle and he can feel a draft coming from a crack in it. Above him, he sees a large square seam in the ceiling and is able to deduce that it is some kind of trap attached to the metal bars holding the stone slab.   
 

 **The rest of the Party** wait in the corridor as they watch 

**Tuffs** go into the second southern room, where they use *Phil* to open the final stone container. Inside is the clay statue of a snake man sorcerer. On the sorcerer's right hand is a silver ring that looks like a snack biting its own tail.   
 

 **DUNGEON DIVE - HOUR ONE - TURN SIX**     
 

**Lorenza** begins physically manipulating the stone slab. Lifting up one end slightly, he notices the metal bar also rises. He is unable to lift the slab any further by himself as it is too heavy.   


  **Tuffs** attempts to very carefully remove the silver ring from the clay finger of the sorcerer statue. The ring gets caught on the knuckle of the statue. The ring and finger are both snapped off the statue, as the pressurized gas cloud shoots from the hole created in the hand. Tuffs covers their mouth and runs from the room, taking a single point of poison damage.   
 

 As Tuffs is leaving the room **Tropheluss** runs in with his smashing rock and bashes in the head of the sorcerer statue, finding nothing of value. Noone else in the party does anything.   


  **DUNGEON DIVE - HOUR TWO - TURN ONE**   
 

 **Tropheluss** immediately runs into the second northern room and smashes snake man scholar with his rock. The poison cloud fills the room, but does not harm Tropheluss due to his Transmit breath spell being active. He loots the statue and finds two more oval gold pieces.   
  

**Tuffs** puts the silver snake ring on their right ring finger. The finger nail on this finger grows rapidly and bifurcates like a snake's tongue. They are able to use this as a natural poison weapon.   
  Everyone else in the party waits for Tropheluss to finish smashing and looting the final stone container.   
 

 **DUNGEON DIVE - HOUR TWO - TURN TWO**   
 

 The party having finally looted all four stone containers, move down to Lorenza who is waiting for them at the stone slab covering the wall. He explains all of his findings to the party. Stating that it will take  3 people to lift the slab off the metal rungs. He says it might be trapped, but  there's only one way to find out. The party deliberate for sometime on how to handle the trap. They consider using magic to blast open the brittle part of the wall. Emery says he is willing to try and smash it wish his hammer. The party eventually decide to prop up their 10 ft ladder against the large square rock in the ceiling, hoping the ladder can hold it, as 3 people lift the stone slab.   
 

 **DUNGEON DIVE - HOUR TWO - TURN THREE**   


  **Emery, Bael, and Lorenza** work together to lift the stone slab. Emery on the left side, Bael in the center, and Lorenza on the right. After some time they are able to pull the slab off the metal bars. When they do, the giant square in the ceiling falls like a hammer, snapping the ladder in two and smashing all 3 of the travelers through the brittle wall and into the next room, causing them tons of damage. Rolling around on the ground in pain, Bael's back has been broken has he took the brunt of the stone hammer.     


  **DUNGEON DIVE - HOUR TWO - TURN FOUR**   
  

**Tomb Room Description: (**[**https://imgur.com/a/CHNavQo**](https://imgur.com/a/CHNavQo)**)** A large octagonal room holds 3 more stone containers on the North side. The center container is larger and much more ornate, than the other two. On the south side of the room is an alcove with a large stone statue of a grotesque frog God, that is melting like a candle. A small stream of water has eroded away a chunk of the statue to reveal a secret passage leading deeper into the dungeon.   
 

 **Iona** grabs the lantern and rushes forward, looking around the room. She sees the 3 party members on the ground in pain, she shouts for Maban to come forward to take care of the hurt members. Iona then steps closer to the melting god statue at the bottom of the room. She notices a small passage under the statue has been created by a small stream that has seeped through a crack in the wall.   


  **Maban** comes into the room, pulling out a leather pouch. She puts her hand in it and removes it covered in a white goop. She rubs it on Bael's back, curing some of his wounds, however his back is still badly broken. She pulls a small vial of black liquid and hands it to Lorenza. She states it will keep him from dying.     
  

**Lorenza** drinks the potion that Maban gave him to recover some constitution.   


  **Tuffs** comes to check on Emery, who says he will survive, but would just like to rest for a few minutes.   


  **Emery** spends his turn resting on the ground to gain back some hit protection.   


  **Tropheluss** steps past the hurt adventurers and spends his turn examining the closed stone containers closer. The center container has carvings of swirling snakes, knotting themselves carved into the edge of the lid.   


  **DUNGEON DIVE - HOUR TWO - TURN FIVE**   


  **Maban** kneeling down beside **Bael,** whispers to him that she can mend his broken back, however he must keep this power she has secret from the party. Bael agrees to keep quiet. Maban places her hand on his back and hums a lullaby. A warm feeling floods bael. His back is magically mended and he regains some of his constitution.   


  **Iona** relays the information she found about the passage under the statue, getting closer to examine it further.   


  **Tuffs** approaches the passage to examine it as well. They feel confident that the party could get in and out of the opening without much difficulty if they'd like to venture deeper. They start crawling down into it.   
 

 **Bael and Emery** slowly stand up, feeling much better now. They both move toward the frog god statue. They offer to move it over a little to make the passage even bigger.   
 

 **Tropheluss** picks up the lantern that was set down by Lorenza, when lifting the large stone slab. He moves back to the large ornate container to give Lorenza light.   


  **Lorenza** moves the lid to the ornate container to one side. Inside he sees the following:   


  ***Bloody  Bones –*** *a humanoid skeleton with bits of muscle and sinew hang limp from its bones. The entire creature oozes a sticky mixture of blood & mucus. Its eye sockets give off an eerie sightless stare, hollowed out.*   
 

 Lunging forward out of the container the ***Bloody Bones,*** attempts to spear Lorenza with its claws, but it just scrapes them along the front of his brigandine armor.     


  **COMBAT ROUND ONE – party win initiative**   
 

 **Lorenza –** Thrusts his spear at the Bloody Bones Skull. 

**Tuffs –** scrambles out of the passage that they were crawling in and readies Phil for battle. 

**Tropheluss –** unsheathes his rapier and assists Lorenza's attack.

 **Iona –** Draws her rapier *Cyclus* and prepares for combat.

 **Bael -**  Draws his axe and spends his turn rushing across the room to get into combat. **Emery –** equips his hammer and readies for combat. 

**Maban –** hides   
  

**Action Narration:** Tropheluss assists  Lorenza as  spear connects solidly with the Bloody Bones Skull, bone chips shattering off the creature. The lids of the other two containers hiss and scrape open, as two more Bloody Bones lurch forth from their slumber.     
  

The first Bloody Bones assaults Lorenza in return, driving his claws into Lorenza's gut. It forces him to the ground, as Lorenza is critically wounded and actively dying. The second bloody bones, rushes forward to meet Bael in the center of the room. A claw lashes out, gouging a deep wound in Bael's arm. The final bloody bones rushes Tropheluss from behind. Wrapping its skeletal claws around his chest and sinking them deep. The Bloody Bones tears Tropheluss' chest asunder, exposing his heart and lungs, killing him instantly.     
  

**(let us have a moment of silence for our first character death.)**   
  

**COMBAT ROUND TWO – Bloody Bones win Initiative** 

**Maban –** Flees from the dungeon, running as fast as they can.

 **Emery-** Swings his hammer in an attempt to crush the Bloody Bones attacking him 

**Iona –** They rush to the center of the room and emit their *Maleficence –* ***Combustion***   
   

The First Bloody Bones that downed Lorenza, stands and rushes towards Tuffs. As it get within range to attack, the Bloody Bones flings its claws in wide arc, catching Tuffs in the throat. Stumbling back and falling against the frog statue, Tuffs drops *Phil,* grabbing and holding pressure on their throat to keep from bleeding more. They're critically wounded. The Second Bloody Bones takes another swipe at Bael and critically wounds him as well, his chest is gouged and raked open. The final Bloody Bones moves towards the next closes combatant, Emery, shredding a piece of his leather apron as it gouges his stomach. In return, Emery bashes the skull of the creature doing significant damage to it. As Bael screams and falls, Iona in a state of panic, takes two rushing steps  forward to the center of the room. Their bracelets and circlet glow as they focus all of their magic and release an explosive combustion wave of orange and red throughout the room. The three Bloody Bones explode into bits of mucus, blood, and bone fragments that cover everyone in the room. The other adventurers are also wounded by this combustive blast, but thankfully no one else is killed.    
 

 **END OF COMBAT**    
  

**DUNGEON DIVE - HOUR TWO - TURN SIX – HOUR THREE – TURNS ONE AND TWO**    
 

 **Tropheluss** body has been destroyed and is no longer a member of the party. (The party member was given the option to play as any of the NPCs current in the party this session. They chose to play Emery.)   


  **Maban** has fled the dungeon and into the woods.    


  **Bael, Lorenza, and Tuffs** are all critically wounded, bleeding, and dying from this combat. **Iona and** 

**Emery** spend the next half an hour tending to their wounded comrades.     


  The wounded members are tended to enough to be able to stand and leave the dungeon. Iona escorts Bael back to camp and into one of the tents to rest. Emery helps Tuffs and Lorenza out to the tents as well.     


  **DUNGEON DIVE COMPLETE.**   


  One of the lanterns still has some oil to burn. Iona decides to go back into the octagonal chamber to collect the belongings that could not be carried by those who were wounded. She also wraps Tropheluss' remains in a bedroll, to be buried later.   
  

The loot that Iona finds from the containers of the Bloody Bones are:   

\- A set of battered, but usable chain armor. 

\-A small black wooden box with a felt interior. Inside is a small bright yellow gemstone ring. The ring smells of sulfur. 

\-A mace with three prongs. Each prong of the mace is the head of a snake. 

\- A 2”x3” flat sheet of Kambaba Jasper. A gem of various green shades and mottled browns.    
  

While Iona is collecting all of the gear and loot from the octagonal chamber, Emery goes in search of Maban. After a very long search, he finds her crying in a ditch under a tree. She threatens to scream if he comes any closer. After a minute of consoling, He is able to convince Maban it is safer for her back at the camp, than to be alone in the woods. She hugs close to him and comes back to camp. Iona and Emery decide to spend the rest of the day and that night guarding the camp, so the rest of the party can rest and gain back some lost Hit Protection.   
 

 **Day 12 – Ferret – Torrential Downpour**   
  

**The perfect day for a funeral. The air is frigid as black clouds cover the sky. A torrential rain fills the vale between the two mountains.**     
   

Wrapping bedrolls and cloaks tightly around their bodies: Bael, Lorenza, and Tuffs lean on axe, spear, and *Phillium,* still resting and recovering. Emery digs a small but deep grave from the wet, muddy soil. He states that he disagrees with the burying of the body. As people from his town, burn the deceased to release the spirit and make sure that they cannot rise in undeath. The party politely decline, stating that they have different customs in their village.      
   

After laying the body to rest, Iona places Tropheluss' ring that she recovered in the dungeon back on his finger. Lorenza places the 8 glow-stones in the grave as an offering. Tuffs lays next to Tropheluss, a hot, fully cooked meal that they had prepared that morning as Tropheluss' first meal in the afterlife. Bael lays the Gargoyle lantern and a pint of lantern oil in Tropheluss' arms, “I hope this lights your path in the afterlife.”    
  

 The offerings given to Tropheluss amount to 2,065 experience to be split among the party members.    
   

The body is then covered with earth. Iona and Mono the goat do their ritual dance and chant around the freshly moved earth, ending with Mono bowing respectfully toward the grave and then peeing on it.    
  

 The party quietly move back toward the camp, huddling around the fire. They spend the day in quiet reverence over the death of their party member. Recuperating from the last lingering wounds of their battle the day before.

ACKS Session Report: War For The Blood Sun,"https://polyfamous.wordpress.com/2022/10/30/session-9-war-for-the-blood-sun/

This is a link to a session report on my ACKS campaign, The Living Urf. We use 1:1 timekeeping and patron play to create a Living game world.

ACKS is a B/X (or possibly BECMI?) retroclone with airtight domain rules for seamless transition between character tiers and easy wargaming. It is as close as humanity will get to a perfect game.

The War for the Blood Sun is/was a special event designed by one of our players in response to the Curse of Lamalla, something from another campaign causing Chaotic issues in a half-dozen other games!

If any of this is interesting to you, message me to join or start your own game! People are running this playstyle in AD&D, ACKS, Gamma World, even 5e (although they struggle because 5e is a bad system).

"Knaves of Illmire - Session 2 report: Geckos, Skeletons, Treasure!","

Last session, the group joined the militia and were assigned to find Illmire’s missing druid, Yorivar. After some shenanigans searching the druid’s cottage and speaking with his friends, they meet up back at the Inn.

 

Previous reports:

 - session 0 and introductory funnel

 - session 1: the official start.

 -  session 2: Geckos,  Skeletons, and treasure 

 
Tonight's Knaves:

 - Arty, the philosopher

 - Eggert, the carpenter

 - Joo, the gambler

 - Grinwit, the thug 


 
The PCs make conversation with another group of militia, asking about the relationship between them and the town guard, when the town guard burst in, wanting to speak with them about what happened with Ruskin and his family. The PCs debate flight or flight as Captain Frey and his men escort the PCs outside, but instead of arresting them for harassing Ruskin and looting his house, Frey tells them not to worry – he understands that Ruskin’s wife has been causing trouble lately, but Father Rand is speaking with her now and will make sure she’s under control.

After a free night at the Inn (the Inn-keeper, Birella, refuses to take money from the militia), the PCs return to the Watchtower to tell Malstern that Yorivar probably went to the Spider Woods, where he was probably eaten by spiders of at least won’t be able to cause trouble. Malstern refuses to believe that a druid would die in the woods where he has allies, and insists that the PCs track him down.

They decide that if they’ll be facing more spiders, they want more of the spider-repelling potion they discovered in Yorivar’s cottage. They return there and harvest the remaining spiders for their venom but find no more stirge saliva to mix it with – perhaps the forest will yield some.  

The group decides against their original plan to speak with the logger’s encamped south of town, and instead head west to the Gecko Fens. A local farmer tells them of an ancient fortress not far away that is now buried by the swamp, and the PCs hire him to lead them there.

After an hour walking, they hear a loud buzzing sound, and see several football-sized mosquitos flying towards them! Both Grinwit and Eggert are bitten deeply before Arty and Joo help kill the pests. Grinwit recognizes the “stirges” from Yorivar’s cottage and harvests their saliva for more potions.

After another hour, the farmer leads them to a gaping hole in the ground, rimmed with slippery rocks. Joo ties a harness with his rope and agrees to go first, but first throws in a torch and estimates it drops fifty feet into water. As he repels, he notices a cave and moves inside, finding larger geckos gnawing on a corpse. Using his torch to scatter them away he sees a reflection from the corpse’s belt – the jewelled pommel of a dagger, which he takes.

Grinwit gets another rope and drops down towards the water but finds a tunnel leading to a large set of brass doors. The rest of the group joins him, and as they move closer to the doors, they notice a skeleton clutching a sack full of gems. Carefully, the group pries the treasure from the skeleton and hopes it’s a hint of more inside.

The brass double doors have an inset, circular handle, and a cross in the upper left corner that seems like an out-of-place handle. Grinwit turns the inset handle counter-clockwise and the doors open.

The PCs step into a long hallway and the doors close behind them. An otherworldly voice echoes “vengeance!” as skeletons rush towards them but are shot down by the PC’s arrows and crossbow bolts before they can reach them. At the end of the hallway is another set of brass double doors, this one with a large keyhole on the handle.

The PCs explore another room off the hallway and find a staircase leading up, and one other door which leads to a room with eight stone pedestals. Each pedestal has a corked vase on top, which Grinwit and Joo open to unleash clouds of poison gas. They cough through it let the air clear before looking inside the vases - each can see a jade statuette, but also a skeletal scorpion crawling around! Grinwit deftly uses his crowbar to lift out one statuette without disturbing the scorpion but is not as lucky the second time as the scorpion clings to the crowbar and drops onto him! He shakes it off and Joo squashes it with the crowbar. The group decide to wrap up the remaining vases until they can figure out how to open them safely.

The room has one other door which looks bloated and swollen. Eggert’s knock on it is muddled and he guesses that the room beyond is full of water – they return to the long hallway and find another door in similar shape and note that it probably connects to the same water-filled room, so they decide to explore up the stairs.

They take a hallway at the top of the stairs and open a door to the left. Inside, they see an eight-foot-tall skeleton, a chain with keys around its waist and a large sword in both hands, in front of a large chest. They try to lure the skeleton out of the room and into an ambush, but it refuses to leave and shelters in a corner away from their ranged weapons. They ignite an oil-soaked rag and toss it into the corner with the skeleton, forcing it out to the open and into their missile fire where it falls. They take the two-handed sword, noting a large jewel in the pommel. Inside the chest, they find 2500 silver and a small lion-shaped statuette with ""Shalmanser"" carved into the bottom. Grinwit places it on the ground and speaks ""Shalmanser"" and a large lion takes form. It rubs its head against his leg, purring, before allowing Grinwit to ride it. 

The PCs move down the hall and find a room with three crumbling stone columns and crates in a corner. Arty finds valuable looking artwork in the crates but is ambushed as giant shrews scramble out of the stone columns and swarm him! Joo and Eggert move to help but are also attacked by giant shrews. Grinwit, riding Shalmanser, breaks through and reaches Arty, but it is too late as the giant shrews leave Arty's corpse and turn to him. Shalmanser rips them apart with claws and teeth, and the group loads Arty's body into the large chest with the silver and other treasures they've found so far.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fadcb60>,osr,1638413595.0

Lyric Sands: Vaults of Vaarn play report 2,"Hello all. Here the second session for my Vaults of Vaarn group.  I use [https://perchance.org/travelinvaarn](https://perchance.org/travelinvaarn) to generate travel days (some copy taken from it), and the dice drop from the zines for the larger point crawl.  Italics are flavour text I use to set the scene for our online game.

Map background graphic is from a topographical generator I have found and since lost, with details drawn up in roll20, which we use very occasionally for assets. (I generally try to be as lo-fi as possible with this game). Information is from the dice drop generator from VooV zine #2 I think.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k7h4f7mwevr81.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff4f2117c60a69f1898644ea10ce47aa1ca7bb61

Cast: Mockbridge - a mycomorph with the visage of a nun; Lask - a mutant clone dedicated to the cult of the dead titan HYPERION; Dolor Est, synth of the torturer's guild; Typhon - a New-Axolotl with a fondness for drugs.

The sun rises over the bruise blue sands of a desert called Vaarn, dappling the eyes of a group of travellers who once more hope to live until dusk.

In the morning they encounter nothing. Immacula, Mockbridge’s mindslave, is eager to play dice with the travellers. Typhon and Dolor seem discomforted by the eagerness that Immacula shows toward this task.

In the afternoon the Travellers come upon a fungus choked outpost (dandelion like fuzz, translucent, dry) and see a dying Brainsnake. Mockbridge stows the brainsnake for a tasty snack later. Typhon takes a lick of the fungus, passing a constitution saving throw and going into HYPERPHYLACTIC shock; a glandular sac at the base of their neck inflating with a lighter than air substance and pulling them, delicately, from the gravity well of urth to levitate 4 feet up. The glandular sac is also sensitive to vibrations, and Typhon has developed super-hearing. (The drugs chart is extremely hilarious and I am so happy I have one player absolutely committed to getting gacked multiple times a session)

The Travellers decide to continue on, taking refuge for the evening in the lee of a prickly pear outcrop. At night the travellers are silently approached by 2 Hiveykin; corpses made ambulatory through territorial wasps and their nests. Gaining a free attack on Dolor and Immacula, the other travellers join the fight quickly.

The battle is protracted and near deadly. Afterward each traveller patches themselves up as best they can in the remainder of night. Bleeding and beaten, what do they ponder as they look up into the spackled band above?

*Starry night, stargazers’ delight: across unfathomable distances great stars burn their hearts out to blast light across the void. And on the crone globe of old Earth, the memory of so many dead celestial objects terminates as a dimpling of the naked sky at night.*

*The ancient furnaces have been winking out since the days of their first ignition. Racing toward their entropic destiny on the ever-spinning loom of gravity. The churning tub of the milky way whirls out beyond the pull of its centre mass – the bleak star some call AZATHOTH. Those great engines long since depleted of fissionable matter still seem to be the source of photonic delight that the stargazer dotes their effort upon.*

*Earthly denizens from across the warp of history have earned their name as they look up and lace constellations together across the adumbral frame of night. But so many old suns have been obliterated by entropy, that they could never have been truly known by any alive. Never known, only remembered, for instance, in the twinkle of the eye of the sign of the mouse.*

*In the lay of the cosmos, only one thing is obvious to the esteemed astrologer; what we believe ourselves to be now will be forgotten. Instead; peeking above the hill of the horizon of some alien world, we will become a part of something vast and ominous and much more indelibly a sign of our nature.*",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fa14d70>,osr,1649234410.0
Borshak's Lair (1976) - actual play report - session 1,"Hi All! I hope you like reading play reports, this is the first time I felt I should share our game. This dungeon is so awesome it deserves more time in the spotlight.

After reading Prince of Nothing's [stellar review](https://princeofnothingblogs.wordpress.com/2022/03/19/review-borshaks-lair-odd-3pp-the-rolls-royce-of-orc-lairs/) of the 1976 Judges Guild adventure Borshak's Lair by Jennell Jaquays (with assistance by Mark Hendricks, spiritual guidance by the honorable Randy Cox and help by Dave Marby), I've decided to run it for my 5e veteran players, while we're waiting for the other DM to prep his game.

# System

I wanted this to be an authentic experience, to play this adventure as people probably played it in the 70's. I wanted to use ODnD. Obviously I wasn't ready for the rabbit hole that is the three brown books, so after a bit of frustration and choice paralysis we've ended up with Basic Old School Essentials. As close as we can get to the original with maximum ease of reference at the table.

I understand the importance of a limited inventory, but didn't want to fiddle with coin based encumbrance, so we've used this [Anti-Hammerspace Inventory System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toKZmUimcKQ).

And to preserve the ODnD feeling, we've borrowed the simple combat sequence from [Philotomy's Musings](https://www.grey-elf.com/philotomy.pdf) (page 32).

# Character Creation

We've had 4 players all experienced in DnD and other rpgs, but it was their first time playing something older than third edition. It took 30 minutes to explain the rules, roll up their characters and get equipped for adventure. The process was the [5 sentence method](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/45636/roleplaying-games/character-creation-in-5-sentences-dd-1974) described by Justin Alexander.

Except they rolled stats 4d6 drop lowest. I thought having slightly higher stats wouldn't impact gameplay much, and since they're used to this method it would lend some familiarity to the process. I also fully expected some pushback on rolling stats in order, but surprisingly they were all happy to play the race/class the dice suggested.

I've also made them roll for adventuring gear like rope, mirror, flasks of oil, etc. They are veteran adventurers after all and wouldn't set foot in a dungeon without a coil of rope. That's by far the most used piece of adventuring gear at our table.

**Player Characters:**

* Anima the Cleric
* Goldenbeard the Dwarf of ambigous gender - male and female dwarves look the same, and it's considered very rude to ask
* Josefanon the mysterious Elf
* Chichi the Thief

And their **henchmen**:

* Boris the Dwarf, sworn protector of Anima. Openly male, to the dismay of more conservative dwarves
* Linda the Normal Human, torchbearer and squire to Goldenbeard
* Richard the Thief, apprentice to Chichi

# Adventure

The party heard rumors of a Valley of Kings, a hidden valley not far from the eastern edges of civilization, where ancient hegemons of old were entombed. They ventured out and indeed at the mouth of the valley discovered an open tomb entrance with lots of fresh footprints going in and out.

Excited by the promise of buried riches, they descended into the belly of the tomb. Right at the bottom of the stairs their torchlight was spotted by the guard in place, a lone orc. They tried to parley, and the orc was swayed by the promise of adding meat to his menu, an equal share of the treasure and free dental work. - *That was me rolling under 20% to see if the orc speaks the common tongue, and rolling 12 on a 2d6 reaction roll. They were also very generous with their offer.* \- Thus Ugluk the Orc joined the employment of Josefanon the Elf.

Ugluk lead the party through the double door into the marble hall, where he warned them against wandering off lest they be seen by other, less friendly orcs. He also told them about his former employer Borshak, and how his forces are not entirely in control of the dungeon.

The party expressed interest in exploring the ""dangerous"" part, not in Borshak's control. So Ugluk opened a secret door and lead the party up a flight of narrow stairs.

The secret passage opened to a room that was sealed off by an impenetrable curtain. It was attached to both ceiling and floor and no matter how much they cut and stabbed at it, they couldn't tear it. Luckily there was enough space between the curtain and walls to move along the side of the room. The party did so, until they found a door leading out of the room and an ornate dagger suspended in air by a thread, wit a note attached ""Passage thru the curtain"". 

Chichi instantly tested the truth of that note, slashing the curtain with the dagger. In the room Goldenbeard took the lead and discovered a pedestal with a crystal ball on it. Along with 2 plate clad skeletons guarding it. In the second round of the ensuing melee both Josefanon and Boris died. - *All it took was a couple of sixes rolled as damage from the skeletons. My d6s were on fire.* \- That nearly broke the party. Anima, Linda and Richard wanted to cut their losses and run for it. Fortunately Goldenbeard figured the crystal ball might be connected to the skeletons and with the assistance of Chichi smashed it to bits. That ended the magic animating the skeletons.

They spent a couple of minutes mourning their friends. Put silver pieces under their tongues so they may have loot in the afterlife, and wrapped them in their cloaks. Chichi pocketed the ornate dagger and Goldenbeard stashed the 2 gems found inside the crystal ball.

They took a peak behind the door leading out of the room, but it was only leading to an empty corridor so they decided to call it a day and retreat. Buried the bodies outside the dungeon and headed back to civilization.

# Aftermath

The death of 2 party members really surprised the players, but they quickly realized they were the ones who wanted to explore the dangerous parts and should have been more careful. Plate armor is much harder to hit than in 5e.

Overall they liked the experience and we'll continue next week. Josefanon's player was especially excited to take over playing Ugluk the Orc.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11facb2f0>,osr,1652389075.0
Lyric Sands: Vaults of Vaarn play report 3,"&#x200B;

Hello all. Here the second session for my Vaults of Vaarn group. I use [https://perchance.org/travelinvaarn](https://perchance.org/travelinvaarn) to generate travel days (some copy taken from it), and the dice drop from the zines for the larger point crawl. Italics are flavour text I use to set the scene for our online game. 

Session 3 Summary: Jeany Law comes to the Desert 

The travellers haul their aching bodies from the dirt and resume their dusty westward plight. With the risen sun at their backs, it takes no time at all for Lask to spot the Hegemony patrol cruiser on the horizon. The four legionnaires are commanded by no officer, and the mood is mutinous. For the travellers, there is nothing but scorn for these legionnaires; identical in all ways to those that jailed them and left them to die on the dunes.

*Even in the far day of earth, after the mountains have been levelled and the sea boiled into salt dunes, there is a constancy among men; they will make of themselves beasts to forget the pain of being a man. Today, Jean, Geraud, Gene, and John will perhaps have a moment to catechize their own vocation of lawbringer.* (I used some Moebius art from dune for these dudes and my players loved hating the frilly boy future french legion). 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Thanks Moebius](https://preview.redd.it/i5tvilvst8t81.jpg?width=250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83aa5582450c606b833e1c81d2918fa730415487)

A plan is hatched to employ coquetry rather than naked violence and the travellers all agree. Mockbridge and Lask will approach the legionnaires, while Dolor and Typhon will sneak in their wake, hiding the skiff beforehand. The nun and the acolyte play to the urthly delights of all soldier-folk.  The hegemon did not imbue these four with enough discipline to resist. In short order Mockkbridge has lured one legionnaire to his quarters for a taste of delicious mindslaving flesh, while on deck Lask has proffered a peek at the salacious handheld device they hold; an oblong of black material that displays images none sane shall ever speak of. The screams of dread and delight mingle wetly in the air and even were Dolor Est not prepared for a sign, they would have sprung forth with something like heat rushing through something like their blood.  The resulting battle is brief and in the traveller’s favour. They strip the cruiser of all its unbolted trimmings but leave a profane sigils in hyperluminous paint that will survive the conflagration they start onboard.

*As a lawless wind snaps the robes of the travellers and they return to their skiff, the red spell of dusk is briefly doubled by the orange light of a scuttled hegemony cruiser. Bestride the salt plains, these travellers have tasted the sweetest vittle: revenge. Would that it were enough to sustain them.*

Knaves of Illmire - Session one report,"I recently started running Evils of Illmire with Knave and posted a Session Zero and Introductory Funnel play report a few weeks ago. This past weekend we started the actual campaign.

Anyone familiar with Illmire will probably notice minor changes from how the adventure is written. The most notable is that adventurers usually start the campaign by arriving in the town of Illmire, whereas my players met a decided to join the militia during our session zero/funnel.

My group has seven players in total – I’ve intentionally made it large so that we can play even when most people can’t attend, so the PCs may change from session to session. This is a concession I’ve made so that I can play more often and consistently.

&#x200B;

Tonight's Knaves were:

\- Croaker, the former grave-digger and current grave-robber.

\- Grinwit ""the dentist"" Abernathy, the former thug who wields his club spiked with human and baboon teeth.

\- Connor, who lost his older brother Bill to giant spiders last session.

The group arrives at the Watchtower and talks with other members of the militia while waiting to be sworn in. They learn that the militia collects taxes from both citizens of Illmire and travelling merchants to ensure their safety, and that they also get paid by priests of the temple of the Luminol Star to arrest troublemakers and investigate ruins around Illmire.

Hogor, who is second in command of the militia, gives them a tour of the fortified camp, and cautions the group to stay away from the vault, the leader's quarters, the prisoner pit, and the Watchtower basement, on Malstern's orders.

Connor wants to talk with the prisoners but is unable to approach them without being seen. He's also thinking of robbing the vault and making a run for it, but Grinwit convinces him that they should bide their time until a good opportunity arises.

Malstern emerges with his dog, Rohn, and demands that all the PCs swear loyalty to him, but to never bother him - that's what Hogor is for. He escorts them to the armoury for new equipment and reinforces Hogor's earlier warning - stay away from the Watchtower basement, it is for senior leadership only! He leaves them with the threat of death should they desert or disobey him.

The group follows up with Hogor, who admits that Malstern treats his dog better than his men. Arty ask Hogor if he would act against Malstern, but Hogor says it's best not to speak of such things. Undeterred, Arty invites Hogor to speak with him more should he ever feel differently or want to leave the militia.

The group find out from other soldiers and that Malstern only recently took over from Sergeant Wilfret, and that there have been changes.

Before they can learn anything more, Malstern appears again and assigns the PCs their first task - to find Illmire's druid, Yorivar.

Father Rand, the new head priest of the temple in Illmire, says that Yorivar has been tempting folks with his pagan ways, leading them into sin and causing many of the perils plaguing Illmire. The town guard tried to arrest Yorivar last night but found his cottage empty. While Connor wants to stay the night so he can sneak into the prisoners' pit, Malstern tells them to start while the trail is hot.

While passing through outlying farms on route to town, the PCs spot a group of fishmen sneaking up on a farm. Grinwit and Croaker duck off the road to observe them, but Arty charges forward with Conner close behind.

The fishmen enter the house and Arty and Conner arrive to see three of them holding the farm family hostage at spearpoint while two others loot the house. Connor boldly announces that he and Arty are from the militia and that forty more soldiers have the house surrounded! The fishmen panic and flee, too scarred to question where the soldiers are hiding.

Connor and Arty tell the family that the militia needs to be paid. The farmers are very grateful, but have no coin to offer, only provisions and a barn to sleep in. Arty asks if the family if know anything about Yorivar, and they say that he is on good terms with most of farmers around Illmire, often helping them with crops, animals, or pests. They say that the fishmen have been infrequently raiding local farms for years but have recently grown bolder as they town guard and militia have not been patrolling as often.

The group arrives in town as the sunset glimmers off Klepperhorn mountain in the distance. Townsfolk tell them that the effect is caused by a giant's crystal palace atop the mountain, but none of them have made the week-long climb.

The PCs start looking for leads on Yorivar at the town's inn and tavern, the Weary Wagoner. Birella, the inn keeper, is happy to engage them in conversation and explains that Yorivar has long led the farmers and citizens of Illmire into sin, but that Father Rand has recently arrived to save them! She tells them that Yorivar's closest friends are Jorrid, the stonemason, and Ruskin, the carpenter. The group also sees some town guardsmen drinking at a table, but when they approach, the soldiers clarify that they are also with Malstern and the militia, not Captain Frey and the town guard. The PCs wonder why they haven't seen any of the town guard yet but decide to pursue it later and excuse themselves to continue investigating Yorivar's disappearance.

Splitting up, Croaker and Grinwit find Jorrid while Arty and Conner try to question Ruskin.

Jorrid refuses to open the door until after a lengthy conversation where Croaker and Grinwit assure him of their help in diverting the militia's attention. Inside, they ask him to confirm their suspicion that Yorivar could have left to confront the fishmen about raiding the farmers. After more assurances that they will keep him safe from Malstern and the militia, Jorrid also reveals that Yorivar has several friends in the forest, including the Froglings, who are being invaded by their Mantismen neighbours, Rigdorf, leader of the logging camp to the south, and the Widow, spider-queen of the Webbed Hallows deep inside Redthorn Forest. He also says he glimpsed a raven-haired woman lurking around Yorivar's cottage last night, but she quickly disappeared, and he was frightened enough to head straight home.

Arty and Conner knock on Ruskin's door and a fearful voice asks who is there. They claim to be friends of Yorivar's, but Ruskin seems unconvinced and is too frightened to open the door. Suspecting that Ruskin may he hiding Yorivar, Conner retrieves a saw from his backpack and starts hacking the door, triggering a woman's scream. Arty tries calming the situation but gets no response from inside the house, then looks around it to see Ruskin with his wife and son fleeing out their back door and towards to temple. Arty and Connor give chase but are unable to catch them before they knock on the temple doors and are taken inside. Realizing that if they leave immediately no one can identify them, Arty and Connor decide to make the best of the situation and return to loot Ruskin's house, but find only common items and less than 20 silver.

Meanwhile, Croaker and Grinwit wade into a grove scraggly willow trees to investigate Yorivar's cottage. Inside, Grinwit finds a helmet and mask made from a giant frog's head, connected via a thin tube to two large air sacs. Writing on the inside of the helmet reads, ""Thank you for helping with the mantis. Beware the fishmen. - Rubigroak.""

Grinwit squeezes the sacs and feels air from the mask, then assumes the device will allow the wearer to breathe underwater.

He moves on to a stone table and bench while Croaker examines a white string hammock on the far wall. The table is covered in items; the corpses of two huge mosquitos, a mortar and pestle, several bottles and vials, including one knocked over and spilling liquid over several papers. One note is still salvageable, reading,

"" - one part stirge saliva

\- one par venom

\- 3 parts water

Boil 1 min""

Meanwhile, Croaker has discovered the hammock is not made of string, but spider webs. Peeking inside, he sees a dozen black spiders. Grinwit, thinking to retrieve venom to test the possible recipe he just found, uses his crowbar to fish out one spider and smashes it on the table. He takes out his knife to cut out the venom sack, but the other spiders attack first! One bites Grinwit and he instantly falls asleep. Another bites Croaker, but he resists the poison and pulls Grinwit out of the cottage and away from the spiders, who stop at the door.

Grinwit's head bounces off the inn steps as Croaker drags him. He wakes up determined to return to the cottage and test the recipe. Inside, the spiders seem to have retreated. The pair go back to the table and look more closely at the oily black and green liquid spilt on the table. Grinwit reasons the recipe's saliva might come from one of the huge mosquitoes, and tries squeezing it - success, as saliva drips out the beak! They collect it and mix it with the venom from the dead spider and water, then boil it in the fireplace as the note suggested. After a minute, they have enough oily, black and green liquid to fill a bottle. They use a piece of parchment to scrape the remaining liquid from the table and floor into another small vial.

Despite the danger of the spiders, Croaker wonders if something could be hidden in the hammock. He risks looking inside, and the spiders move to attack! He backs up and holds open one of the bottles with the concoction he just boiled, and the spiders recoil from it! Grinwit uses the other vial of liquid and they able to hold the spiders away as they search the rest of the cottage but find no additional clues.

On their way back to the inn Croaker and Grinwit discuss what they've found; they agree that Yorivar would not have visited the Fishmen without the Frog-helmet to help him breath underwater. They believe it far more likely he has gone to Webbed Hallows, given the recipe and spiders they found in his home and his friendship with the Widow. This should give them enough to report to Malstern, but they're still not sure if they trust him or how he and the militia fit into whatever is transporting in Illmire between Yorivar and Father Rand.

They head back to the inn to update Arty and Connor (who have returned from their own ""investigation"") and plan to glean some information from the militia members, such as:

\- where and who is the town guard? What is their relationship with the militia?

\- what is the relationship between Malstern and Captain Frey?

\- what is the militia's relationship with the temple?

\- do these militia have any orders from Malstern?

They note that they will not mention Sergeant Wilfret for now – they suspect he is being held captive in the Watchtower basement.

&#x200B;

Pending this conversation, their plan is:

\- report back to Malstern that Yorivar has fled to the Webbed Hallows where he probably met his end - their investigation is finished!

\- if Malstern wants them to keep searching, they will go to the logging camp next

\- they will find time to speak with Hogor in private about Sergeant Wilfret.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fa149b0>,osr,1637266190.0
Session 2 - Lohilan - A Knave Hack Actual Play Report,"**This is a repost. The old thread was deleted. While attempting to make significant changes to the original post, the Reddit editor would not allow me to save the edits. I'm sorry everyone!**

Hello Everyone! Here is Session Two of the Lohilan Campaign!

For a recap of events from the previous session please refer to the following Reddit Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/oskyps/session\_one\_lohilan\_a\_knave\_hack\_actual\_play/](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/oskyps/session_one_lohilan_a_knave_hack_actual_play/)

Maps of Lohilan and Fourtower Bridge: [https://imgur.com/a/xSnD2pp](https://imgur.com/a/xSnD2pp)

**Day 7 – Mouse (Night):**

**Lorenza –** There is a moment of silence between Everild, the Banded Swordsman and Lorenza. Everild eventually breaks the silence, asking what brought Lorenza to Fourtower. Lorenza plays dumb, saying that he isn't quite sure why he is there, but that his leader, Tinner, has promised that it will be worth coming to Fourtower. Everild considers this while looking down at dead man's rapier. He tells Lorenza that it was nice to make a friend and that if Lorenza promises to never raise sword against him, he will give him the rapier as a gift of friendship. Lorenza promises loudly and with conviction he has no wish to declare a duel against Everild. At this, Everild hands Lorenza the rapier and retires to his room.  Lorenza picks up the steel rapier with blue scabbard and hilt. The pommel has the embossed sigil of the Svanlindale Academy of Dueling on it. The rapier is as light as a feather and takes up Zero inventory slots.

**Tuffs –** Still drinking and cheesing with the merchants Harold and Gord. The latter is currently falling out of his chair, heavily intoxicated. Harold asks Tuffs what ingredients the two should pick up on their travels. They will be returning in a week for their next dinner party. Tuffs asks for fine bread, cheese, rum, and venison. Harold slings Gord over his shoulder and drag him up stairs.

**Bael –** Bael goes to leave the House of the Morning Sky. The Cleric Madjken advises Bael that should he take his party down into the depths of the Watchtower Ruins, she would like for him to bring back either one of two artifacts. The first is the book of names, containing the name of every soldier in Queen Ehlissa's army. The second being the Watchtower Captains badge of office. A small pin/wand with Ehlissa's sigil engraved on it. Bael thanks Madjken and retires to the Inn.

**Tropheluss and Iona –** Running across Fourtower bridge, they burst into the Moorland Magpie Inn, where the rest of their party are waiting in the main room. Upon seeing Tropheluss' awful wound, Lorna, the owner of the Moorland Magpie grabs him and steals him away to a small bedroom to patch him up. Iona explains to the party the events of what happened to them from her point of view. The party is both confused and frustrated that one of the party members is already in such a rough state.After a moment, Lorna returns from aiding Tropheluss. She advises the party that his wounds are quite deep and that he should be left alone to rest and recover for a few days. Lorna hands the party Trophleuss' map making/navigation supplies, stating that he thought the party might need them. **(Tropheluss' Player was absent during this session. This seemed like the perfect way to write him out for a session.)**

The party hearing this distressing news, sit down at a table in the inn to discuss their next plans. Tinner and Goken pop down from their rooms when they hear the rest of the party are back. Tinner gives each party member 5 pennies to spend on supplies and says that he only has 3 pennies left now. Whatever the party decide to do, they will need to make some money if they want to stay in town another day. The three options that they discuss are:Go 	to Tinner's treasure site 2 days west into the woods. Go 	into Bal's weird chest dungeonGo 	down into the Watchtower Ruins and acquire one of the two artifacts

The Party eventually settle on going down into the Watchtower Ruins. It keeps the party close to Tropheluss and the party can't turn down the 100 copper piece each reward. Goken states that should he be expected to be the party's torchbearer for this quest, he must have his sword back. The party agrees to this. Everyone then heads to bed.

**Day 8 – Toad (Midnight)**

Iona is woken up by a very soft, gentle stroking on her cheek. When they wake up, they see a very tiny spider sitting on the window sill in front of the open window. It is waving one of its legs in a slow “Come here motion” while holding up another to signal silence. The spider then crawls out the window. Iona terrified, crawls on the ground to the window, peeking over the sill quietly. Standing in the road, un-moving and alone is a figure bathed in moonlight, their features obscured by a long black cloak. The figure starts making the exact same slow “Come here” Motion as the spider, with a long sleeved arm.

Iona grabs a knife from the first floor bar and steps onto the Inn's porch. The cloaked figure takes a few steps toward Iona. Iona whispers stressfully, “OK, fine, what do you want?!” to which the figure replies in a low grating voice like two stones being scraped together, “Took you long enough to get down here girl! Do you know who I am?” Iona asks if she is “The Spider” The cloaked figure snaps back, “I am Sheelba, of the Eyeless Face. The greatest sorcerer to every walk Lohilan.” To which Iona replies, sarcastically, “OK. Congratulations.” Sheelba goes on to explain that a little spider told them that Iona is seeking a Magic Patron. Sheelba states that Iona should leave the old bumbling Wizard Bal to Tropheluss, as he will not be able to help her.

Sheelba gives promises of power, and truths to the mystery of Iona's parents disappearing bones. Sheelba says that the burnt bones of her parents still walk Lohilan. When Iona asks if Bael knows this, Sheelba yells at Iona that her brother is not to be trusted and that he spreads nothing but lies. That Bael's purpose for bringing Iona on the expedition has been to remove her further from the truth. Sheelba states that should Iona wish to know the truth, Iona will complete but one task. Inside the Watchtower Ruins is the fiery heart of “The Furnace.” Iona must bring Sheelba the heart. In doing so, Sheelba will give some of her power to Iona and reveal the full truth of her past. Iona asks how to find Sheelba. The Sorcerer says that they need only to talk to a spider to deliver a message. Iona asks about the great power offered to her. Sheelba tosses Iona a tiny glass vial. Inside is a very tiny intricate weaving of webs and an equally tiny spider. As Iona's attention focuses on catching the vial, Sheelba has disappeared. Iona returns to her bedroom, unable to get much more sleep.

**Day 8 – Toad (Morning 7am):**

**Lorenza –** The first to wake in the morning, Lorenza heads directly to the blacksmith Roark. He pays the 1 copper toll to cross the bridge. Roark is working on a set of horseshoes when Lorenza enters. Lorenza asks Roark if he buys weapons and shows him the rapier he acquired. Roark examines the rapier, pulling it out of its scabbard. On the blade is written, “To my love – From Bonny” Roark asks about the sword and Lorenza tells him the story of Everild killing the man in the road. Roark says that he refuses to buy weapons from Everild, as he does not feel right taking weapons from slain people. Lorenza counters, stating that he isn't buying a sword from Everild, but he's buying a sword from Lorenza. Roark, annoyed and upset at this, offers to pay Lorenza 10 copper for the sword, on the condition that Lorenza never come try and sell him anything else. Lorenza agrees, taking the 10 copper. Roark tosses the sword on a table dismissively.

**Iona and Tuffs –** While sitting at a table eating breakfast, Iona opens the wax sealed letter that she got from the dead man two days ago. The message reads as follows:

“*My dearest bonny,* 	*I have only the best of news to send you in my absence. While in Gulluvia, I was able to procure us lodging above the Chimera Apothecary. The proprietor Vault, has requested that I become his apprentice. But I have found something even better. A man so famous, he is recognizable by headband alone. Should one best him in a duel, they will garner incredible fame and fortune. And you said all my time at the academy was pointless. I am the best duelist in all of Svanlindale.* 	*While shopping in the markets, a strange witch gave me the enclosed. They said it was the key to my heart. Alas my heart is frozen and aching to think you alone in this cold autumn in Svanlindale.* *PS – I shall return within a fortnight. We shall abscond together with our hearts unlocked and ablaze.*   *Yours,* 	*Aloysius”*

In the letter is a well used ancient key. Once a bright gold it has been worn down over time. Etched into the shaft of the key is a sigil recognizable to Iona. Tropheluss' Sigil. He is unfortunately in no state to comment on it at this time.

Tuffs, hungover from a heavy night of drinking, stuffs their face with sausage and oatmeal. They ask Iona how they came into possession of a sealed letter. Iona explains they took the letter off the dead man. Iona tell Tuffs what the letter says and shows them the key. Tuffs confronts Iona, stating that they stole a possession from a dead man. What makes Iona any different from Goken and his grave-robbing? Tuffs states that Goken's debt to the party is bullshit, if the party is going to go around committing the same crimes, that he is being accused of. Iona does not have a good counter argument to this and stumbles over their words, saying that as a good gesture they think they will return the letter to Bonny. Iona states that Bonny should know what happened to Aloysius. Tuffs suggests also returning his rapier to Bonny, Iona thinks this is a good idea as well.

The party then all go shopping before their first dungeon dive. Tuffs buys 3 torches from Millie, The party pool some resources to buy a 50 ft. length of rope. They also borrow a tinderbox from Madjken, because they can't afford to buy one.

The party then meet at the Watchtower Ruins. Goken is given his sword and Mono the goat is told to wait outside until the party returns. In the Northwest corner of the ruins is a stone tile with the sigil of the House of the Morning Sun etched into it. Bael lifts the stone and moves it to the side, revealing a small hole in the ground that leads into darkness. The party tie some rope to a grappling hook and secure it to a rock. Dropping the rope down, it  falls about 10-15 feet before hitting ground.

Map of Floors 1,2, and 3 of the Watchtower Ruins: [https://imgur.com/a/164BYT2](https://imgur.com/a/164BYT2)

**DUNGEON DIVE – HOUR ONE – TURN ONE**

**Floor 1 Description:** This small circular room is chock-a-block with industrial sized wooden crates. Placed and stacked haphazardly all around. There is water seeping in from a hole in the stone in the west wall. In the southwest is set of stairs going down. There is metal on wood scraping coming from inside one of the boxes. The entrance to the dungeon is a small hole in the ceiling in the Northwest corner.

**Lorenza** is first to descend the rope with torch in hand. Surrounded by industrial sized crates of various sizes stacked all around him. There is just enough space to fit one more party member in this area.

**Bael** then drops down beside Lorenza and tests the crates, they are too heavy to move easily. He boosts Lorenza on top of the crates.

**Lorenza** crawls over them and into the center of the room. He heads down the stairs.

**Tuffs** Drops down next to Bael, Tuffs lights another torch now that Lorenza ran off. Together with Bael they spend the rest of their turn moving and clearing enough space in the crates to move through them without having to climb over.

**Iona and Goken** \- Waits above for Tuffs and Bael to clear them room to come down.

**DUNGEON DIVE – HOUR ONE – TURN TWO**

**Floor Two Description:** This floor contains a single staircase that connects Floors 1,2, and 3. There is a small landing with a single wood door that leads to a small semi-circle room filled with junk.

**Lorenza** \- Descending down the stairs and through a wood door to small room he find a man, mumbling to himself and rooting through a pile of junk. The man has jet black hair, mottled gray skin and stands no more than 3 feet tall. Lorenza calls out to him, “What you got there buddy?” The man jumps frightened, “Oh Don't hurt me! I'm just looking for food!” Lorenza asks what he's doing in a place like this looking for food. The man explains he crawled up from “The Deep.” Lorenza asks if the small man has any shiny metals he could trade for food. The man says he doesn't have any shiny metals but has darker ones in the Deep.

**Tuffs, Iona, and Bael** – All 3 move across the crate room to the stairs, Tuffs leading the way. The small creature that was rooting around inside the crate, pops out of a hole it made in the wood (Reaction: Hostile) It immediately charges Bael!

*Geballings - An oversized, slightly deformed full helmet supported by a pair of dirty taloned feet and dragging an awkward, heavy metal tail. The surface of their helmet is decorated with whatever trash they are currently enamored with. From visor of their helmet sport a cluster of iron-bone spikes, which as they use as weapons and as primitive manipulators to scoop up pieces of treasure-trash.*

**Bael** – Spinning around at the top of the stairs as this little beast charges him, Bael successfully grabs the beast by the tail, holding it mid-air as the geballing flails around trying to pierce him with his bone spikes, but doing no damage. He bashes the creature against the stone wall with a hard smack. The creature begins vomiting random objects before dying from the wall bludgeoning it's taken. The only vomited object of note is a ceramic mug sculpted to resemble a grinning face.

At this moment the party realize that Goken has been standing outside the entrance to this dungeon the whole time waiting for orders. They shout at him to catch up, which he promptly does.

**DUNGEON DIVE – HOUR ONE – TURN THREE**

**Floor 3 description:** A statue stands in the main room on this floor. The main room contains 3 doors and two sets of stairs. The stairs in the north lead to Floor 2. The stairs in the south lead to floor 4. The 3 doors lead to a disheveled flooded library, a caved in room, and a small meeting room.

**Lorenza** \- Asks the small gray man to take Lorenza to the metals. The man asks if Lorenza has any food to which he replies, “Maybe. If you got any metals. Preferably coins and not swords, those are problematic.” The under-gnome leads Lorenza to floor 3, nervously explaining that he and his friends are escaped slaves, trying to get out of the Deep.

**Bael, Iona, and Goken** – Descends to floor 2. Bael and Iona search the rubble and crates that the under-gnome was stopped from searching. Goken takes the torch from Tuffs and holds it for Bael and Iona. They find a 10ft ladder, metal tongs, and a magnifying lens. Bael finds the “Black Tulip” (This is a black piece of construction paper with a rune based sudoku on it. Folded up into the shape of a tulip. Should Bael solve the Sudoku outside of the game and bring it back, he will learn to read runes.)

**Tuffs**\- Descends to floor 3. They find Lorenza and the under-gnome. Tuffs asks Lorenza who he is with, to which Lorenza says “Oh this guy? He works for me don't worry.”

**DUNGEON DIVE – HOUR ONE – TURN FOUR**

**Tuffs and Lorenza** – Following the under-gnome into a partially collapsed room with a toppled desk and 3 other under-gnomes huddled around a lamp, it's light is slowly dying. The lead gnome advises his 3 companions that the two large people would give them food if they had any metal to trade. The under-gnomes rummage through their rough-spun sacks, pulling out a small saw, hand drill, and a bag full of marbles. The gnomes ask if this is enough for food. Lorenza asks why they haven't found any treasure if they have been down here for awhile. The gnomes say they've only been looking for food. Tuffs, feeling bad for the gnomes gives them Tuffs only ration, which they share.

Lorenza advises the gnomes they are close to the surface, the gnomes get excited and say that if they can get to the surface, they can escape the Arcanids. Tuffs, shocked, asks what the Arcanids are. The gnome replies, “They're like giant angry people who enslaved us.” The Gnomes agree to help the party later if they are taken to the surface. Tuffs agrees to guide them back up top and starts going up the stairs. Lorenza searches the toppled desk, finding a blank journal and 3 small bells.

**Iona, Bael, and Goken** – Descending to the third floor, they enter a library. Flooded to their ankles, bookshelves cover the walls, most of the books have falling off the shelves and into the water. Standing off to one side of the room is a large hideous creature (reaction: Talkative):

*A hunchback hairless jackal faced beast with pitch black eyes. Two rows of  shark like teeth glisten from the torch light. Its skin is an iridescent oily black and quills cover its entire backside, from head to back, arms, and legs.*

There are also two *Geballings* in this room as well, splashing around in the water poking and prodding the garbage.

The creature whirls towards the light and yells at the party, “Mortals!” Iona tries to backup, but Goken is frozen in the doorway. As Iona takes a step back the creature demands to know what the party is doing down here. The party state that they are just passing through and no harm will come to them. The creature replies, “Of course no harm will come to me! I am Suffering!”

The party state that they are just looking for some cool shit to loot and Suffering advises them that if they find the Book of Names, it belongs to him and he will destroy them if they touch it. The party realize that this creature has been down here for a very long time and still has not found this large tome.

Iona asks about the Furnace Heart, to which Suffering replies that his brother is not as kind to mortals as he and that they should beware him in the floors below. The party say thank you for not killing us and quickly back out of the room closing the door. Suffering can be heard on the other side of the door yelling at his Geballings to search the room faster as he kicks one across the room.

**DUNGEON DIVE – HOUR ONE – TURN FIVE**

**Floor 4 Description:** This floor has two stairs cases. One staircase leads up to floor 3, another leads down to floor 5. There is a long hallway that connects the two stairs cases. There are two wooden doors on this floor. One door leads to a small meeting room which leads to a small bed room. The second door leads to a large bedroom with a closet.

Everyone in the party meets back up on the third floor main room. Discussing everything that just happened to them. When the Book of names is mentioned, the lead gnome, who introduces himself as Ray Dew says that they saw a book that matches that description. He says it is, “Down, around, down, door.” From where the party is now.

**Tuffs** – Takes the 10ft ladder, lights a torch, and spend the whole turn guiding the 4 under-gnomes to the surface. They set the ladder up at the entrance, so that they don't have to climb the rope to get out.

**Iona, Goken, and Bael** – Enter a small office with shin deep water pouring in from a hole in the wall. A toppled desk, leans against a wall unaffected by the pooling water. There are also a pair of bookshelves partially flooded. Bael searches the desk, Iona searches the bookshelves. They find the following items: a helmet (looks a bit like a geballing, but is actually just a helm,) another blank journal, a steel circlet with a celestite gem, and a warhammer helping prop up the table.

**Lorenza** – Immediately descends the stairs to floor 4, upon hearing that the book they seek is below them. He rushes down a long hallway and down another set of stairs to floor 5. Upon seeing a ton more doors and staircases, he gets the feeling  he may have gone too far.

**DUNGEON DIVE – HOUR ONE – TURN SIX**

The parties tummy's begin to grumble. Everyone adds a level of the hungry status to their inventory.

**Iona, Bael, and Goken** – The three party members descend the flight of stairs to floor 4, entering the small meeting room. The small meeting room appears to just have a small circular table and some chairs. They keep moving into the small bedroom. The bedroom has two small decaying beds and a metal footlocker. They decide to search the bed and footlockers:  They find fishing equipment, a set of worn/beaten lockpicks, a textbook (Volume IV: Fungi of Lohilan) and a small scroll. Unraveling the scroll reveals a small potion bottle: A small smooth conical glass bottle with a cork stopper. The contents are a gaseous orange. A glued on label states: “Healing in a new flavour!”

They dump a lot of this stuff onto Goken for safe keeping until they get out.

**Lorenza** – Goes back up the stairs to floor 4 and enters the large bedroom. There is a destroyed and decayed queen bed, a toppled wardrobe, a writing desk, and a small closet with a wood door. Lorenza spends the rest of his turn righting the toppled wardrobe.

**Tuffs** – Having made sure that all 4 of the under-gnomes have made it to the surface, they Begin hauling ass down the stairs as quietly and quickly as they can attempting to catch back up with the rest of the party.

**DUNGEON DIVE – HOUR TWO – TURN ONE**

Goken and Lorenza's torch flicker and fade out. The party has lost 2 torches. Tuff's torch still has some light left in it. Iona adds a pint of oil to her lantern and lights it. Lorenza also adds a pint of oil to his lantern and lights it.

**Lorenza** – Having righted the wardrobe last turn, Lorenza begins looting it. They find the following items: a small hand-painted portrait of Queen Ehlissa, an albite gem of blue and white, two sets of fake jewels (Glass), and a set of fine clothing (Blue tunic, gray trousers.) Lorenza replaces some items in his inventory, swapping them for the painting and albite gem.

**Tuffs**\-  Racing down the stairs, they hear “Suffering” let out a loud, frustrated growl that rumbles the stone walls and echoes through the halls. All the party members hear this and gain 1 level of stress for spending too much time, so close to the horrifying monster. Tuffs hauls ass the last few stairs and rushes into the large bedroom containing Lorenza.

**Goken**\- has started pacing some, visibly stressed as well.  He guards the door to the small bedroom room with his sword Palehell.

**Iona and Bael** \-  Takes a turn to rest, sitting down on one of the destroyed beds and eating rations in an attempt to stave off the hunger and calm themselves down.

**DUNGEON DIVE – HOUR TWO – TURN TWO**

**Tuffs** – Having entered the large bedroom, they see Lorenza looting the wardrobe. Spotting the fake jewels and fine clothing that Lorenza passed up, they add it to their inventory. They ask Lorenza where the rest of the party is to which Lorenza replies, “Haven't seen'em!” Tuffs gives a resigned, “Great.” in reply.

**Lorenza** – Takes the turn off to light his lantern and eat a ration to get rid of his hunger.

**Goken** – Pacing faster, growing ever more nervous. He asks Iona and Bael how much longer they plan on staying down there, how much light do they have left, where are Tuffs and Lorenza? They haven't seen either of the pair in over half an hour. Bael says that their plan is to find the other two and decide what to do from there.

**Bael, Iona, and Goken** – Rushing down the long hallway and into the large bedroom, they find Lorenza eating a sandwich and Tuffs stuffing their pack up with loot.

**DUNGEON DIVE – HOUR TWO – TURN THREE**

Iona gives Tuffs the helmet they found. Tuffs immediately puts it on and says, “Listen guys, we gotta go man. I don't know what's happening. I'm getting' real hungry. I gave my shit to the gnomes. There's a monster hanging out upstairs.” Bael asks the party if they want to finish searching this room and then had back up to the surface. Everyone agrees.

**Tuffs and Goken** \-  weapons drawn, guard the door to the bedroom.

**Bael** \-  Opens the closet door and searches through the junk that is piled there. He finds two small gems called apatites, blue crystals found in the shape of glassy hexagons. Bael also finds the stone head of a gargoyle. The top of the head has a brass ring to be carried by. Turning the head around, it reveals itself to be a lantern. (Magic Item: Lamp of the Gargoyle)

**Iona** – Searches the destroyed and decaying queen bed. They find a set of traveler's clothing and a folded up 100 year old map of Lohilan. The map reveals 3 new locations to the party: The castle of Queen Ehlissa, The mountain city of Bohn, and the Vault of Great Kalhoun.

**Lorenza** – Searches the writing desk. Pulling open the drawer, a large beautiful spyglass sits untouched. Picking up the spyglass, a much smaller objects rolls to the front of the drawer. A small round pin (badge of office) in the shape of a wand with Queen Ehlissa's sigil glistens in the lantern light. Unfortunately, Lorenza is out of  inventory space. He turns to the party and says, “ Oh guys look it's the quest item. Somebody grab that!” Tuffs comes over and picks it up for him.

**DUNGEON DIVE – HOUR TWO – TURN FOUR, FIVE, AND SIX** **The party decides to not press their luck any further. They want to move towards the surface as safely as they can. Three more turns go by. Rolling for encounters, the party does not encounter anymore monsters on their way back.**

**Day 8 – Toad ( Morning 9 AM):** Exiting the Watchtower Ruins, the party find the four gnomes waiting for them  up top. They are all squinting and covering their eyes, complaining how awful the sun is and why would anyone want to live here. One of them has climbed on top of Mono the goat and is trying to get it to giddyup. The goat does not look amused. Tuffs sends the gnomes towards the inn for food, stating that the party will catch up later, as they need to turn in the quest item.

The party first head to Millie's Sundries to sell off the extra stuff they found in the dungeon. Millie advises the party that she does not have a lot of coins on hand (260 copper on hand). The party can either take a written check to the bank in Liwil, where she has an account or they can take it as store credit with Millie. The party sell the following:

**Lorenza** \-Albite (10 pennies),

**Tuffs** \- Fine Clothes (125 credit), **Iona** – Standard Clothes (45 pennies)

**Bael** – Pair of Apatites (50 pennies), Lens(50 credit), Blank Journal (300 credit) Bael requests that 250 pennies of his store credit are donated to a good cause. Millie opens an account in the name of the Under-Gnomes who have just entered the town. She will use the money to pay for their stay at the inn and anything they need to get settled in Fourtower. Baels tally after the donation is 50 pennies and 100 store credit. Bael has 250 experience.

**Bael –** Buys 6 hours worth of lamp oil, 4 Rations, and a Tinderbox for 43 pennies

**Lorenza –** 2 Rations for 10 pennies

**Tuffs**  \- 3 Rations for 15 pennies

Millie has 165 pennies left at the moment.

At the House of the Morning Sun, Madjken takes the badge of office from the party. She looks disappointed that the party was unable to retrieve the Book of Names that she requested. The party said that they are interested in going back down to find the book, but there was a monster down there also looking for it.

After describing the monster to Madjken, she states that what they encountered was a soldier of the late Lich Acererak. Acererak was known to employ many beasts of the underworld. They go by various names. Devils, Demons, etc. The one they encountered sounded like a Tanar'ri.

Madjken leaves for a moment and returns with a small chest. She walks around handing a single gold piece to all the party members, including Goken. A flood of emotions pass over Goken's face. Joy, apprehension, fear, and relief all mix across his features. The party all stop to watch him. Bael says, “You know Goken. If you go to Tinner, you can pay the debt to the village.”

After a deep breath he places the gold coin on the table and slides it to Tuffs. Tuffs picks up the coin and says, “Thanks buddy. Here you go.” Tuffs places the coin back down and slides it back to Goken, “Your debt to us is now paid.” Goken looks at the coin astonished, asking Tuffs, “Really?” Tuffs says yes. Goken picks up the coin ecstatic. He says that he has to go. He rushes from the temple, off to pay his debts in Gulluvia before he is arrested again. (Tuffs gains 100 experience for giving up the coin to Goken.)

Madjken offers the party a new quest. Should the party retrieve the Book of Names from the Watchtower Ruins AND remove the Tanar'ri known as Suffering from the tower, she will pay the party 500 pennies to each party member.

Before leaving the temple, Lorenza donates the small portrait of Queen Ehlissa and a blank leather journal to Madjken (Gains 300 experience)

The party runs a few more errands. At Roark the smithy, Bael trades the warhammer for Alyosius' Rapier “Featherlight.” Iona pays 15 pennies to have Roark make her a rapier as well. He states that it will take 10 days to finish the sword. He offers to work solely on the sword if she wants it done faster, but it will cost her an extra 8 copper for each day he knocks off the completion time. Iona gives a total of 44 copper toward this project and he knocks 4 days off the completion time. The rapier will be ready in 6 days. Bael asks if Roark would repair some beat-up lock-picks he has. Roark refuses to assist in thievish endeavours. He says if they wish to be rogues, they'd find better company with Silar and his gallery.

Iona and Bael immediately head to Silar's Gallery. Silar is a mid 40s, well dressed, and dapper man. He tells the two at the door that entrance to his gallery will cost 50 pennies each. Iona trades the celestite circlet that they found in the dungeon as the entrance fee. While inside, Silar pours the three of them a glass of fortified wine. The gallery is well furnished with dark purple silk draperies and painting of Bacchanalian portraits. Silar asks the duo what their poison is: A good time, Jewelry, a child servant, artwork, perfume, weapons, anything what are you looking for. Bael asks if there is anything he can do with his beat-up lock-picks. Silar tosses the worn-out lock-picks in the trash and gives Bael a set of new ones, saying that this is covered by the door fee.

He mentions that should the party need to get rid of any items that are less than legal, he would be willing to get rid of them for the party in trade for some small round metal objects (wink.) Iona asks if he could get her a rapier in less than 10 days. Like tomorrow. Silar says of course, he can acquire her the finest quality rapier by tonight for 125 pennies, she counters with 1 gold piece. He agrees to the deal. He advises her to come back after dark to make the transaction. The duo then leave to catch up with Tinner and the party at the tavern.

As the party enters the tavern, Tinner is standing at a table where 4 under-gnomes sit shoving their faces with sausage links and luke-warm oatmeal. The party catch snippets of an exasperated Tinner, “They did what?!” “They were yelling at who?!” “What was happening?!” His face grows more frustated as he tries to decipher what the small folk are saying through mouthfuls of Lorna's home-cooked breakfast. Whirling around Tinner sees the party and exclaims, “Oh Thank the Gods, I couldn't get anything out of these people. What is going on!?”

The party, looking stressed out and tired from their first dungeon dive, sit down at a table and explain to Tinner the events of the last 3 hours. Bael gives Tinner 25 pennies, Tuffs gives Tinner 50 pennies to send back to the village. (Bael gains 25 experience, Tuffs gains 50 experience.)

This ends Session Two.

Hole in the Oak Session Report 1&2,"I asked r/OSR for some advice last week and after a ton of helpful replies I wanted to share how the session went and ask a couple follow up questions!

The PC’s:

Thandie Moore: Halfling with a jewelry obsession “More hair than person”

Rocco Daring: Charismatic but not too bright thief “Just a real greaseball”

Brast Irontusk: Trenchcoat and big sword wielding assassin “Imagine a That Guy and you have Brast”

Rocco’s Retainers:

Jemma: Valkyrie in appearance, shit heel in personality

Iyisha: Formerly an archer now a Magic User

Eilish: Heavy footman

Amar: Light footman

Nola: Archer

Francis: Torchbearing Peasant

Session 1:
This was an absolutely unplanned one shot with only Thandie & Rocco since Brast’s player couldn’t make it and what spawned most of my questions the first time around.

We started the session out in the glade in front of the Oak, with Rocco having come into possession of a map leading to the dungeon.

Choosing to head in the direction of the warmth and green glow as opposed to the sound of rushing water the part encountered their first obstacle in the wall of blocking roots. Noticing the slight movement of the roots, Thandie offered up her torch which was quickly snatched and brought deep within the tangle. As the roots burned the party heard an ominous rumble as the tunnel shook. Unperturbed they continued forward towards the stench of ammonia only to quickly turn back when checking the ceiling and seeing the all the bats hanging overhead.

Before their exploration could continue they heard the upbeat song of a mutated ogre looking out for gnomes and decided to try and parlay. One high reaction roll later and Rocco and the ogre were deep into their negotiation of exactly how much the ogre was willing to pay for a sweet halfling treat, the party sprung their trap with the thief backstabbing and their retainers opening with a salvo of shots. The ogre managed to mutate Nola and Iyisha with a terrible skin condition and a third eye respectively before good rolls by the party forced the ogre to surrender the 130gp he had on him for his life.

With the ogre taken care of, the faces of the deep revealed themselves, demanding delicious gold for secrets. Both the pc’s fed the faces some gold and acquired some helpful hints.
Beware the hunter and search for the silver sword hidden in stone.

Reasoning that they should continue to follow their nose, and desiring some baked goods the party soon found themselves accepting some nice tea and crumpets from the sheep headed faun Ramius and his flock. Rocco refused the tea and both Jemma and Thandie succeeded against their saves leading to a 3v3 battle ending with Ramius’ flock slain and the faun himself escaping with an invisibility potion. The party looted his chambers and called it a successful venture.

Session 2:
Deciding that neither Thandie or Rocco trusted the banking system our thief snuck out in the dead of night to bury his treasure under a tree while the halfling found a small nook in town that the humans were too big to get into in order to store her loot.

Now back at Harper’s Gate for a week, Nola quit the group while Iyisha found her new third eye granted her the ability to read magic. Demanding Ramius’ grimoire to remain in the group  a short negotiation ensued where she agreed to take the book in return for sacrificing her share of the next expedition to the Hole. Here they also picked up the new party member Brast as well as the peasant boy Francis to light the way for them.

Some minor shopping later the next expedition began. 
Burning the roots had caused a cave in to the east, meaning their only path was northward the party was bemused by the malfunctioning wizard’s greeting to find a large circular room with an ornate rug. Taking no chances they rolled the rug up making sure to not step on it and had Iyisha use her new abilities to tell them this was a teleportation circle. Acting on Rocco’s desires Jemma then spartan kicked poor innocent Francis into the circle to see exactly what would happen. Thandie then dutifully lit her own torch and the party continued on, avoiding the room with the hunter’s statue and suitable weirded out by the room full of tiny corpses.

Good luck and no encounter rolls led them to the next passage with a pair of locked doors. Jemma was sent to knock as Brast listened in. Another 13 total rolled for a reaction check:
“Hello, this is UPS body delivery.” 
And the Troglodytes opened the door to a surprise round that wiped them out before they could react.

 But the party’s luck was soon to run out, as they spent 40 minutes carefully emptying the trapped chest and arguing about where to rest, 3 ghouls from the north snuck up killing Rocco in the opening salvo and forcing the rest of the party to flee with the treasure they had. Quick thinking led them to throw all their rations on to the teleportation circle as they ran past, removing one of the ghouls from the equation and scaring the rest away as they hightailed it out. (RIP Francis)

And that’s where we left off. Our next session in 3 weeks and the first casualty taken and the group planning on visiting a church to prep for dealing with undead and taking their vengeance.

Unfortunately no one left living knows where Rocco had buried his loot. 

Which leads me to my follow up question, again largely pertaining to stealth. I wasn’t able to find much info in the OSE rule tome about the effects of darkness. I know if you have a torch you can’t surprise enemies and the rules say a blind creature can’t attack. But how does that impact an assassin/thief? Hiding in shadows and being able to attack from them doesn’t work if you can’t see but having a torch ruins it. Or do you usually just give a small penalty for insufficient light?

Thanks again for any answers. I’m really enjoying the way OSR play pans out!

 **Day 8 Toad - Noon**   
  

The party has just finished their first dungeon dive during the morning of the Toad. After exiting the Watchtower Ruins, they dispersed to various stores, selling the loot they got and preparing for the next step of their adventure. After their spree, they enter the Moorland Magpie Inn just in time for lunch.     


  Sitting at a table is Tropheluss, the ex mail carrying Translocator (This party member was absent last session. He has returned this session.) He has recovered enough from his wounds from the previous night to sit up and eat solid foods. The rest of the party sit down around him at the table, still looking very stressed out from their dive a few hours earlier. Tropheluss asks what happened and the party give a VERY brief description of their small adventure, giving almost no detail into the monsters they ran into or the loot they gathered. Tinner then approaches the party and advises them that he will no longer be able to assist them in their journey. He believes that they have a strong enough footing to go their own way now and can't really help them anymore. Tinner will be a semi-permanent resident of the Moorland Magpie, as he reinstates his duties as  Myr's trader. He is willing to take them to the location of the original treasure that he found, but will not be staying to help them in any capacity, including the use of his cart and goats.   


  At this time I asked everyone in the party to have some **campfire connections** that they would like to have while they are eating lunch. As it has been a little while since they've all sat down to discuss all that has happened and what they plan to do next. Here are the connections that came from that:   


  **Bael:** Turning in his completed Black Tulip Sudoku puzzle from the last session to the Referee. The referee advises the party that Bael has earned the first title in the game. He is now Loremaster Bael. Should Bael spend an exploration turn studying runes, he can read them. He can also spend an exploration turn reading a magic user's sigil to find out who wrote the sigil (All magic users innately have this ability.) 

  **Iona with Tropheluss**: Iona talks to Tropheluss about the rapiers that she is going to be coming into possession of. The one she commissioned from Roark the blacksmith and the one she is going to buy from Silar's gallery on the night of the toad. She says that she feels bad that she couldn't help him when he was assaulted and wanted to give him something to protect himself. When the rapier from Roark has finished being built, Iona will give Tropheluss this weapon. Tropheluss starts talking about his traumatic experience in Bal's Grammarye and states that it isn't Iona's fault he was hurt. Iona says next time they go down in to the Grammarye they will all go together. 

  **Tuffs with Tinner:** Tuffs confirms with Tinner that he will not be staying with them, should they go to his treasure location. Tinner says he is willing to take them their and help them drop off any equipment they might want to make camp with, but that he will then return to the Moorland Magpie. Tuffs then asks what they can expect from their journey across the bridge and into the wilderness on the western side of the river. Tinner states the location is set at the base of two mountains. And that the trip should take about 2 days in good weather conditions. Last time he went out their, he stated that his other party encountered two different types of human like people. One group were owl-like people with flat faces and tiny hooked noses. The other were pig-faced fat humans with large axes. He stated that his party avoided both of these small groups as to not give away the location of their secret treasure location.   

  **Iona with Bael:** Iona discusses with Bael the various options they have to choose from for their next adventure. Iona states that if they go back down into the Watchtower Ruins, she will need help recovering the “Fiery Heart of the Furnace” and Bael asks if the item is dangerous, to which Iona replies that it is, but it will make her more powerful. Iona also states that they wish to seek out Bal in his Grammarye, because the party is starting to accumulate magic items that they don't know much about and they will need more powerful magic items to fight the Tanar'ri called “Suffering .” 

  **Lorenza with Iona:** Lorenza asks Iona about how many people they think live in Myr (their home village.) The party decides on 132 people (Including Tinner and the party.) Lorenza says there are 127 people in the village not counting the party, give or take, and everybody has their strengths and weaknesses if you line them up, but has never met anyone with magical powers. He starts questioning Iona about whether or not she has magical powers, to which she hems and haws and says anyone can be magical. She eventually concedes that yes, she does have magic powers. But that she doesn't see herself as strong as a warrior, just because she has magic, as Lorenza states he thinks magic users have power. Lorenza then gives Iona advice on how to use a rapier including, “Well, generally you stick them with the pointy end.” 

  **Tuffs with Iona:** Tuffs asks if Iona got a good look at the creature they encountered in the Watchtower Ruins. Iona says she did, and that it was as big as Bael and looked like a crocodile porcupine monster with bright glowing eyes that was bossing around the smaller helmet monsters to locate the book of names that the party was looking for. Tuffs proposes that they NOT go back down into the Watchtower ruins, because they don't feel like dying to a powerful creature. They state that they should go talk to Bal about getting magical powers and if this were a game they should be trying to “Level up” before fighting something that powerful. Iona agrees that they should go speak with Bal. Iona states they should also check in with Tinner and his treasure location. Tuffs and Iona are on the same page about their mission now. They commiserate over how terrible being down in the dungeon for only two hours was and Iona states maybe they should find some liquid courage for next time. 

  **Bael with Tropheluss:** Bael is glad that Tropheluss is feeling better and is raring to go on an adventure. However, after being down in the ruins, they realize that they really need to be prepared more for the next time. Bael then transfers the rest of his Millie's Sundries credit to Tropheluss so that he can buy any gear that he wants before they go on their next adventure. He suggests buying a few rations, as they party got very hungry down in the ruins, even though they only ate just before going down there and he should be prepared for a snack time for the next dungeon. Bael asks if Tropheluss would be willing to go back down into Bal's Grammarye after what happened to him. Tropheluss says he doesn't want to, but will if it means it will get the party more powerful. Tropheluss warns Bael that once they go into the dungeon, they will not be able to communicate as there is a large humming that deafens anyone inside. Bael states that he is worried for Tropheluss and Iona who don't have any armor and that he will do his best to protect him. (Tropheluss gains 57 pennies in General Store credit from Bael.)   


  **Party discussion:** The party discuss the three options they feel moving forward. They can go back into the Watchtower Ruins in an attempt to retrieve the Book of Names and fight Suffering. They can go into Bal's Grammarye and attempt to find the wizard to assist them with magical items. Finally they can have Tinner take them to his original treasure location that they originally signed on to go to.     


  After some debating back and forth about the best option, the party decide that they all have different ideas about what they should do next or in what order. They would like to try and gather a little more information about the locations they are going to. They decide to take a vote the morning of the next day, with the majority deciding the course of the next leg of their journey. The party then split up to find out more information and gather supplies.   


  **Tropheluss goes shopping:** At the various stores, Tropheluss buys some general gear including torches, sacks, and the only dagger from the blacksmith. Heading to the stable, Tropheluss asks Bren at the stables how much it would cost to buy a goat and cart. Bren says he will sell his goat and cart for 300 pennies. Alternatively he will rent out the cart for 5 pennies a day for an agreed upon amount. Should the party go over the agreed upon days, the fee will double to 10 pennies a day. Should the goat or cart be lost, they will be responsible for the 300 pennies it is worth to acquire new ones.   


  **Tuffs at the general store** and attempts to sell their book on Fungi that they got from the dungeon. Millie says it looks like a boring collector's item that will just sit on her shelf. Tuffs asks what kind of person would be interested in the book and Millie says a nerd. Tuffs asks what a nerd is to which Millie says “Book people” Tuffs exclaims, “There's people made of books!?” to which Millie says, “No, they're normal people, they just don't travel a lot and stay indoors. Bal is a nerd.”     


  **Bael goes to Athalgrim's vault** to discuss more about Bal's Grammarye. A large barbarian like man answers the door shirtless. After a brief conversation, Bael learns that Athalgrim owns a magical vault that he can store items of great value for the party for a price. He also learns that inside Bal's Grammarye is a gong that is constantly ringing. Should they wish to summon Bal the easiest way to do so is to stop the gong from ringing, but be warned this will piss him off, so they need to make sure they bring something worth distracting him over.   


  

**Day 8 Toad – The hour between dog and wolf**   


  **Bael and Iona go to their meeting with Silar** at his gallery. Iona shows Silar the 1 gold piece and Silar shows Iona the rapier.     


  *The blade is strong and has a sharp edge with 4 runes running down the flat side. It has a guard like a tangle mess of wire, an indigo silk grip, and a round pommel with a long brown tassel on the end. The scabbard is made of  wood and is wrapped in the same indigo silk as the grip*    


   Bael attempts to read the runes, but Silar objects saying that he wants to conclude their business and have them be gone. The pair say fine, but ask about Bal. Silar states that Bal loves his reading and has been known to stay down their for up to six months at a time. That most people who come looking for him eventually give up waiting and return  home. Iona trades the single gold piece for the rapier. As Iona grips the rapier, a woman's high pitched scream can be heard throughout the entire hamlet of Fourtower. Silar kicks them out and slams the door shut.   


  **The entire party run from the Moorland Magpie and Silar's gallery toward the scream,** that emanated from behind Millie's Sundries. Millie is standing in shock as her two rottweilers, Thongrok and Brute, are engaged in a rolling, scrambling melee with three hideous *creatures.*     


  ***Cyclus Hounds –*** *Slender, hairless rat faced canines. Their skin is pulled tightly over their bones, showing no sign of organs or muscles. Coming in various shades of colors*   


  The ***three*** ***Cyclus hounds*** fighting Thongrok and Brute are shades of grey, green, and red. The party sees Thongrok currently unconscious on the ground (however, there is no blood around them.) and Brute is doing his best to fend off the other three.     
    
  **COMBAT ROUND ONE – Party wins initiative**     


  **Tuffs** – equips their staff named Phil and engages the Grey Cyclus hound.   
  **Bael –** Runs up to the Red cyclus hound and attempts to grapple them.   
  **Lorenza –** Runs up to the Grey Cyclus hound and attempts to spear it   
  **Iona –** Attacks the Green Cyclus hound with their newly purchased rapier.   
  **Tropheluss** – Runs up behind Iona and engages the Green Cyclus Hound with his dagger.   


  **Action Narration**: Grabbing the Red Cyclus Hound around the waist, Bael lifts the hound off the ground into a bear hug. The Red hound attempts to bite Bael, but cannot get through his armor. Working together, Tropheluss corals the Green Hound into an advantageous position as Iona stabs it through the ribs as black blood pours from the wound. However, the hound lashes back biting Iona on her sword arm. Iona is overwhelmed by the sensation of crippling agony, pain, and suffering as it feels like the hound is rending her arm from her shoulder. The rest of the party sees the hound bite down on Iona's arm, but does not pierce her skin and causes no physical damage to her. Tuffs using their quarterstaff named Phil, prods and pushes the Grey Hound in range of Lorenza's spear as pierces the hound's shoulder. The Grey hound lashes back at Lorenza, its teeth scraping along his armor but not connecting with flesh. Brute, the rottweiler engaged with the hounds, dashes into the woods and away from the melee.   


  **COMBAT ROUND TWO – Cyclus hounds win initiative**   
  **All three hounds make the same attacks as the previous round. Red on Bael, Green on Iona, Grey on Lorenza.**     


  **Tuffs –** Attacks the Grey hound with Phil, the quarterstaff   
  **Bael –** Attempts to smash the red hound against the hound that is attacking Iona   
  **Lorenza –** Stabs the Grey Hound again.   
  **Tropheluss –** Takes a stab at the Green Hound   


  **Action Narration:** The Green Hound, biting down on Iona's arm, tightens their grip, sending another wave of agony and suffering through Iona. Overcome by the pain, Iona drops to the ground, comatose. Bael, using their physical strength, slams the red hound in the direction of Green hound, distracting it. Tropheluss takes the opportunity while the Green hound is distracted to stab it in the side. Tuffs whacks Phil against the Grey Hounds head as Lorenza deals a tremendous stab through its side.     


  **COMBAT ROUND THREE – Cyclus Hounds win initiative**   
  **The Grey and Green hounds break from combat, rushing back toward the Watchtower Ruins, they dive into the hole left open by the party. The Red Hound still firmly within Bael's grasp, attempts to escape but cannot muster the strength.**   


  **Lorenza –** Runs over to the Red Hound held by Bael and stabs it   
  **Tropheluss –** Drops down by Iona to render aid.   
  **Tuffs –** Assists with the attack on Red Hound   
  **Bael –** Attempts to snap Red Hounds neck   
  **Iona –** Continues to be unconscious   


  **Action Narration:**  Lorenza runs up and stabs the Red Hound through the neck, as Bael holds it exposed. Black blood begins spraying from the wound, covering Bael's arms and front. 

&#x200B;

**Combat ends.**   


  **Tuffs** – Carries Thongrok inside Millie's sundries, where they attempt to calm down Millie, who is inconsolable. She is wailing about how the village is usually so peaceful and that they've never had anything happen like this before. She asks how those beasts crawled out of the Watchtower Ruins and where the whole came from. She cradles Thongrok and begins weeping uncontrollably. Tuffs runs to the Watchtower Ruins, pulling the ladder from the hole. They replace the large stone tile, covering the hole to the ruins. Then running towards the Moorland Magpie to catch up with the rest of the party.   


  **Bael, Tropheluss, and Lorenza –** Picking up Iona, who is unconscious, but otherwise physically unharmed and take her back to the Moorland Magpie. Lorna the inkeeper is baffled that yet another member of the party has been wounded in 24 hours of their arrival and puts them in the bed that Tropheluss was just in. Iona is completely unresponsive to any stimulus. The party explains to Lorna the attack that just occurred behind Millie's Sundries. Bael goes to talk to the Under-gnomes, to see if they know anything. The gnome leader Ray advises him that they have never encountered these creatures before and if he did, they certainly would have run away. Frustrated, Bael heads back to the rest of the party.   
  

  **The party attempt to figure out more about these creatures and this attack**. Tropheluss takes Athalgrim to the dead Red Hound and Lorenza asks Madjken for assistance. Athalgrim knows nothing of these kinds of creatures. Madjken runs over to the Inn and finds Iona unconscious. She places a hand over her heart and says a prayer to the sun. Her hand glows and Iona wakes up, her consciousness returning as she feels a calming warm sensation fill her body.     
  

Madjken then meets up with Lorenza, who has been guarding the dead hounds body, just in case. Madjken explains that these hounds are called “Cyclus Hounds” and are minions of the Tanar'ri. They have cursed mouths. The hounds are in a constant state of starvation, but can never kill their prey. They are scavengers who are fed by their masters. She suggests that Lorenza burn the body, which he does using a pint of lantern oil. Bael finally reads the runes on Iona's rapier, which she names “Cyclus” after the first creature she wounded with it. The runes say: “Strength Through Loyalty – The Fox”   
 

 **The party then decide to rest for the night.  Feeling that this day has been more than eventful.**   
  

&#x200B;

**Day 9 – Cat (Sunny clear day)**   
 As the party come down for breakfast, their stress from the previous day fades away. They gain all lost hit protection, spells, etc. 

**Madjken, The Cleric** is waiting for the party in the main room of the Inn. She accosts the party for leaving the entrance to the Watchtower Ruins open. Fourtower is her home and everything she loved could have been destroyed, had the demon called Suffering escaped from the ruins and not just his hounds. She demands the party make things right with Millie and be more careful in the future. The party states that they will.   
  

The party then vote on what they should do next. Iona, Tropheluss, and Tuffs vote on going to Tinner's Treasure location. Lorenza votes to go to Bal's Grammarye. Bael abstains as the majority has already decided. They tell Tinner the news and advise him that they will be leaving at noon on this day.  The party decide to look for more hirelings now that Tinner and Goken will not be in the party. There are two new arrivals to the Moorland Magpie. A large old bald man with dirty arms and a young girl wearing tattered clothing.     
  

**Tuffs –** Goes to speak with the Large man. The large man turns out to be Emery, a former blacksmith, who is short of words. His arms are covered in black, as he was helping Roark in the smithy that morning. He states that he will go with the party and will protect them with his life. However he will not carry their baubles and will not hold a torch. He wields a large sledgehammer. His fee for joining the party is one share of the loot. The party decide to hire him, however, he is not allowed in the take for magic items. Should any magic items be found, they are put into a separate loot pile for just the main party. He agrees to this arrangement. As Tuffs is packing up their stuff to leave, they give Lorna a big hug.     
  

**Iona –** Goes to speak with the young girl eating breakfast in the Inn. Iona learns that this girl is named Maban Di-Morton. She is an incredibly depressed exile from the village of Morton. The village accused her of witchcraft and drove her out. Maban states that she is not a witch, but was an apprentice of a physurgist in the town's apothecary. The old physurgist taught Maban how to make healing poultices. To test the girl's knowledge, Iona shows her the vial of gaseous orange that they found in the ruins. Maban immediately identifies the potion as a poison and states it is the opposite of a healing potion, as the label on the bottle states. Iona offers Maban 1 gold piece to travel with them. Maban states that she will do so, but that she is scared of the dark and hopes she doesn't have to go into any dark places.   
  

**Lorenza and Bael –** Go to Millie's Sundries to make amends. She asks that they make a donation to the person who brought Thongrok back from their coma (Madjken) and they agree to do so. They also agree to find Brute who is still lost. It takes them two hours to find Brute but they eventually track him and bring him home. Millie says that their apology has been accepted. The party buy a few final supplies before leaving, including more rations for the trip, lantern oil, and a sack of 8 small glowing pebbles (like glowsticks.) Lorenza goes to Madjken and makes a donation of 10 pennies to apologize. 

Bael tests his Gargoyle Lantern in a secluded part of the town. Placing the oil in the lantern and lighting it. The mouth of the gargoyle drops open and a beam of light like a flashlight shoots from the mouth. The light doesn't do anything but provide illumination, as Bael makes various tests on it, shining it on objects and placing his hand in front of the light. After only ten minutes the light winks out and the mouth closes.     
  

**Tropheluss –** Goes to the stable and rents out Bren's goat and cart for 10 days for a cost of 50 pennies. Bren says if they return early, he will give them some of the money back.      
  

Just before noon, the party go over all their equipment that they currently own. Loading up their cart as well as Tinner's with everything they need to go on their next expedition. As Maban and Emery arrive at the designated time, they set off west, paying the fee to cross the bridge and heading into the unknown.

"Play Report: B/X, Catacombs of the Old Seaside Monastery","Hey all, some time ago I had my first OSR game with my main group, a one-shot based heavily on A Litany in Scratches from Michael Prescott's Trilemma Adventures. You can check it out [here](http://blog.trilemma.com/2014/12/a-litany-of-scratches.html)! This is quite a lengthy rundown, I wasn't quite sure how to properly condense it.

&#x200B;

The party consisted of:

Uurf the Dwarf, exiled from his homeland.

Cobb the Halfling, seeking treasures to pay for the medicines for his sick mother.

Darcy the Thief, sly, cunning and out for gold.

Maximilian the Cleric, somewhat twitchy and strange.

&#x200B;

The hook:

The town of Nermsburg and its periphery has been plagued by a young Fire Drake, who eats livestock, sets fields ablaze and is a general threat to the local population.

With war raging in nearby lands, the Baroness of Nermsburg has little soldiers to spare, thus she recruited a handful of adventurers to travel to the beast's lair and slay it.

Reconnaissance by her huntsman revealed that the Fire Drake has made the long abandoned cliff-side monastery its lair.

Wrecked by fire decades ago, no one has visited in ages since the surviving clergy left the place behind, religious laws normally forbidding common folk from entering such hallow places.

&#x200B;

The session:

The party arrived at the seaside cliffs, guided by the Huntsman, and stands in front of an old overgrown guardhouse build against the cliffs.

The monastery itself sits on a number of plateaus lower than the other cliffs and is only accessible through a tunnel behind the guardhouse.

Thus the party bid farewell to the huntsman, ventured forth through the tunnel and ended up on the other side way down near the sea.

A short vale laid between them and the two story monastery and the bell tower, the bridge connecting the tunnel to the cloister had collapsed on two separate places.

&#x200B;

Instead of trying to jump, the party played it smart and used a stairway hewn out of rock on the side to venture down into the vale, which seemed to have once been a garden of some sort.

Upon inspecting some crevices, Darchy found the opening of a cavern behind some bushes and thicket, which Uurf inspected for a bit, concluding is was partially man-made for sure.

But instead of exploring the cave the party used Darcy's rope and grappling-hook to hook to the railing of the collapsed bridge, climbing up on the other side of the vale and entering the monastery.

&#x200B;

Upon entering the ground floor they could hear movement on the floor above, looking into the courtyard they could see a large tree and a stone gate hewn into the cliff on the other side, which was barricaded with doors, furniture and other large objects.

They were immediately drawn to a large tree in the middle of the cloister's garden, which appeared half-burned, partially alive and in bloom and split open from the top.

Maximilian went forward to inspect the tree, but as he entered the courtyard a doglike, scaly humanoid the size of a dwarf jumped down from the walkway above.

It appeared somewhat intelligent, wearing ragged clothes and having a chipped knife stuck in its rope belt.

Promptly it began to sniff the various party members, yelping and barking, as more dogmen looked down from above.

The new residents of the monastery didn't seem immediately hostile, but when they followed the sole dogman to the staircase leading to the second floor, they were met with low growls by the ones up above.

Efforts by the party to communicate in speech didn't work, they offered some water, which was accepted, but they were not yet allowed to come up into the dogmen lair, being met by warning growls and dogmen backing away as they tried to approach. They discussed giving them treats or gifts, but decided to turn back to the garden first.

&#x200B;

The party went back to the tree in the courtyard, dogmen looking down from the second story walkway above and watching the party's actions. Maximilian, knowing that this tree would be considered holy and finding its abandonment by the previous monks to be strange, climbed up to peer inside the hollow crevice.

Gazing inside the tree, he found that hollow space ran down to the roots where they formed a crevice of some sort.

At the very end, deep down, water could be seen shimmering in the few faint rays of sunlight that managed to reach.

The party decided to enter the tree, forgoing their current objective of finding a way up into the monastery and bell tower.

With Darcy's rope secured, Maximilian lighted his lantern and ventured down into the narrow crevice, dogmen upstairs yelping out and running from the walkway as he did...

&#x200B;

As Maximilian crawled through the tunnel he descended down into a large chamber with a domed ceiling, which was covered in roots.

Murky water stood up to his knees, numerous entrances of narrow hallways ran to this chamber and the walls were decorated with mosaics of holy men, but the parts depicting their faces had been smashed or removed.

Glistering sparkles could be seen in his lantern-light as under the water the floor of room seemed to be littered with precious relics and holy valuables.

But the Cleric was drawn to the roots of the tree which had taken over the chamber, he gave the safety sign and began following them...

&#x200B;

He came upon a ghastly sight.

Against one wall sat a decaying skeleton on a large wooden chair, clad in rotten priestly vestments and having a disintegrating tome in its lap.

Roots ran up to the skeletal remains, filling its ribcage and forming a thorned crown of sorts on its yellowed skull.

By now the rest of the party had descended down after Maximilian and Cobb was already busy stuffing his backpack to the brim with wet treasures as the Cleric lightened up the skull with his lantern as he began to inspect it more closely.

&#x200B;

Suddenly the remains sprang to life, declaring themselves to be the former abbot of this once holy refuge and being surprised at being awakened by the light of these strangers.

After inquiries from the Cleric it became clear that the abbot and his pupils had long ago found themselves on a new spiritual path which, according to them, was not limited by the flesh.

Water could be heard splashing in distant hallways and the party scrambled, Uurf began climbing up the rope again while Darcy tried to find an exit by using her torch to detect air streams to the outside.

Finding a passage wherein her fire flickered, she called Uurf, who descended down again, Cobb started moving too but was slowed by the heaps of collected loot.

Maximilian seemed oblivious to the coming danger as he began to try and take the bones of the Abbot apart and stop the oncoming undead, but to no avail.

&#x200B;

Skeletons animated by dark forces rushed into the chamber and Maximilian began casting Protection from Evil while the rest of the party made their stand in the narrow passagway Darcy had marked as an exit.

Three of the undead poured on Maximilian, who held them off, but Cobb was wounded greatly by one and only just managed to run past Darcy and Uurf while skeletons were behind him.

Up ahead in the hallway Darcy, Uurf and Cobb where in more Skeletons could be heard approaching, the dwarf and halfling moved up while Darcy tried to slay the skeletons rushing from the chamber into the hallway and make a safe passage for Maximilian.

&#x200B;

In the distance, yet more skeletons could be heard making their way through flooded halls towards the central chamber.

The Thief tried using one of her aces, a firebomb, but as the catacombs were flooded the fuse was extinguished after the bomb was thrown and hit the water between her boney adversaries.

Maximilian, by now suffering mortal wounds, retreated close towards the entrance Darcy and the others were in and sprinkled the walls with blessed salts as his dying action, preventing the unholy undead from passing through as he succumbed to his injuries.

As Cobb and Uurf managed to take care of the handful of Skeletons in the hallway up ahead with a combination of dwarven strength and halfling throwing skills Darcy came to join them and the trio ventured forward into the unknown.

&#x200B;

Finding the catacombs spilling into a cave, they began climbing the steep walls as the sounds of the sea could be heard and rays of sunlight reflected from the walls up ahead.

The cavern was the same one which Uurf had inspected way earlier, soon the party stood outside in the vale once more, except wounded and with one less party members...

&#x200B;

Looking upon their current situation, Cobb suggested to retreat, having scrounged up enough gold to pay for his mothers medicines.

Darcy and Uurf, not too fond of staying in the place by themselves, agreed.

And thus the party returned to Nermsburg and the Fire Drake remained unslain.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fae9a90>,osr,1626809206.0
Actual Play Report - Cobeton Heroes (B/X),"Not sure if people like these actual play reports or not. I wrote it up for my kids to recap our ""journey so far"" before our session tomorrow. Thought I'd share.

Zurth the Thief, Sozaf Ran the Elf, Hebror the Magic User, and Crearferduz the Dwarf arrived in Cobeton. The city is protected by the walls of the fort which keep it safe on the frontier known as the Witch Kingdoms. In the local tavern they heard rumors of an old abandoned keep to the south and something amiss in the mines to the northeast. Tired of being poor, the four adventurers decided to head south to the abandoned keep since it was closer.

They arrived at the keep without issue and chose to enter via the front door. Once inside they were confronted with the first real choice of their adventure, left or right. The door to the left was locked. Zurth was unable to pick the lock and Crearferduz began putting his shoulder to it. The pounding attracted the attention of six wolves which attacked the party from behind. Crearferduz and Zurth almost went down before the fight even began but it was Sozaf Ran who cast his mighty sleep spell and put three of the six wolves to sleep. Crearferduz and Zurth got their revenge and the remaining two wolves fled. The sleeping wolves were dispatched and the party decided to go explore in the direction they had come from leaving the locked door behind.

Hebror narrowly avoided a pit trap in the hall which had three doors and a staircase leading down at its end. The first door was open and was clearly the wolves’ lair. They skipped the second door and instead tried the third door which was locked. Zurth successfully opened this lock and revealed a long cell block. Searching the cells Crearferduz found a sack of gold and a patch of yellow mold. He risked the mold to get the gold, a risk which paid well. Continuing to search the cells they disturbed a Crab Spider which Sozaf and Crearferduz were able to dispatch without too much trouble and found several potions as a reward for their effort. Zurth found a ring but didn’t tell anyone.

Beyond the block of cells was a torture chamber which doubled as a lair for a large cobra. The party spotted the Cobra and decided to leave it be, spiking the door shut on their way out.

Back in the hall the party, which was beginning to feel the cumulative impacts of their encounters, decided to check out the other two rooms in the hall instead of risking the lower level. The room where the wolves had been living turned up some silver, but while searching they disturbed the inhabitants of the room across the hall. The party, half in the hall and half in the wolf den, was beset by stirges. An especially hungry stirg drained Zurth in one slurp. Crearferduz and Sozaf were on their last breaths as they finished off the striges and found a good amount of treasures that the creatures had stashed in their lair.

With Hebror being the healthiest of the remaining party they decided to cut their losses and return to Cobeton with the equivalent of 744 gold, a magic ring, and one less thief than they started.

One week later two adventurers, Vlanik the Fighter and Baf Buzusk the Cleric of the Lucky God, approached Sozaf, Crearferduz, and Hebror who were taproom legends due their new found gold which they were spending freely. They wanted to join up and the party was ready to head back to the abandoned keep which in truth they had explored very little of on their last trip.

The party arrived at the keep without event. They chose to take the hallway they had cleared on their previous trip and headed down the stairs to the lower level of the keep. They encountered a gray ooze in the lower hall and chose to go the other direction. They barged through the stuck door at the end of the hall directly into a trio of very hungry carnivorous apes. Sozaf immediately put all three to sleep and the party dispatched them. The ooze followed the party into the room but broke off the pursuit to begin digesting the dead apes.

Rather than bother the ooze and its dinner the party pressed forward and surprised six hobgoblins. Hebror cast Charm on one and Vlanik, Baf, and Sozaf each slew a hobgoblin before they had any time to react. The remaining two hobgoblins look shook but ready to continue the fight. The charmed hobgoblin, named Glunfrik, stabbed one of his former companions in the back and Sozaf finished off the last one. Just as the party was going to commence looting the bodies five gnolls burst into the room. Their plan to ambush the victors of the previous engagement was successful and both Vlanik and Glunfrik were dead before anyone had time to act.

The party, feeling confident due to their string of victories, attacked but the gnolls gave no quarter. Baf fell next and Crearferduz gulped down a healing potion to stay in the fight. Hebror ran, successfully jumping the gray ooze and making his way toward the stairs. Crearferduz and Sozaf followed, both narrowing avoiding blows and diving past the gray ooze which had begun to follow them through the door. Now the ooze was between the five gnolls and the party which was in full retreat. The gnolls, determined not to lose their prey hacked their way through the ooze with wild abandon and continued the pursuit of the party up the stairs. The party fled down the hall, hugging the wall to avoid the pit trap. The gnolls were not aware of the pit trap on this level and three of them fell to their presumed deaths. The remaining two, suddenly realizing the odds had fallen quickly out of their favor, attempted to flee. The party pressed their new found advantage and slew them with arrows in the back.

Then Crearferduz, Sozaf, and Hebror pressed back down to the second level to investigate where the gnolls had come from and finish looting the bodies of the hobgoblins. They discovered the gnolls’ lair and a concealed chest which they smashed open to reveal thousands of coins. They picked through the coins, stuffing their packs and pockets with all the gold ones, and concealed the rest under the rags and refuse of the gnoll den with a plan to return better equipped to get the treasure out.

374 gold pieces richer, Crearferduz, Sozaf, and Hebror returned to Cobeton looking for more brave souls to venture with them into the keep.

Short play report: C1 Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan,"I just finished the third session of three where I'd given four players the task of escaping [TSR's first competition module](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/m/product/17031) 
within a total of four hours (twice the tournament alloted time!). We used my [rules light **Smithy of Sacrilege**](http://seanfsmith.itch.io/puffin) for its flexibility and lack-of-GM-rolls, and it was a good match.

Some highlights:

- Casual snobbery from a millenias old crawfish

- The elf set himself afire to take down a dozen zombies

- Upsetting a neriad by accidentally killing her pet

We ran over Google Meet with a pool of players drawn from [The Grognard Files' audience](https://thegrognardfiles.com/) and I made liberal annotations on my POD copy of C1! I very much plan to offer this at cons when the world wakes again from its 5000 year slumber.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fa16120>,osr,1623270845.0
Playtesting an OSR version of 5e.,"After having a look over the threads about 5e and whether it could ""OSR""  or not, some common refrains came up: ""You can't make 5e OSR without a ton of work,"" and ""You *can* but the system will fight you the whole way.""

**Challenge accepted.**

I sat down and compiled some specific optional rules from the 5e DMG and PHB, wrote a reaction roll based on AD&D 2e's implementation, added a 10-minute interval to break up dungeon exploration,  ported the RC's single save vs death, and used a version of side initiative that roughly mimics B/X but with a d20. The doc is 8 pages long, only a page of which is ""new"" or added, the rest is just text of the PHB/DMG's variant rules for ease of reference (*also* why I can't just share the whole document, sorry). This took roughly 4 hours to hammer out, checking my work and making sure the B/X play loop is accounted for. Another 4 hours to format into a useable doc at the table. This was not ""hard work"" at all, but a breeze.

**The rules:**

* Basic Rules only for class/subclass/race/subrace selection; no feats, no multiclassing.
* 3d6 down the line
* Roll hit points (re-rolling 1 and 2 for first level only)
* Roll starting gold and buy equipment
* XP for Gold
* Monster XP by CR is divided by 10 (rounded down)
* 1 death save and failure = death

***Player’s Handbook (5e)***

* Variant Encumbrance Pg. 176

***Dungeons Master’s Guide (5e)***

* Background Proficiency Pg. 263 (no skill/tool proficiencies)  
**Rogues** always add their proficiency bonus to ability checks for **hearing noises**, **picking locks**, **finding and disabling traps**, **moving silently**, **picking pockets**, and **climbing walls**, and can apply the Expertise feature to one of these specific categories, but not the same category twice.
* Loyalty Pg. 93 (Hireling loyalty system)
* Morale Pg. 273
* Healing Kit Dependency Pg. 266
* Slow Natural Healing Pg. 266
* More Difficult Identification Pg. 136

**Conversions/ported rules:**

**The 10-minute interval**

When exploring a dungeon, it’s easy to lose track of how much time the party has spent exploring, fighting and searching for treasure. To make this easier, break down each in-game hour into **6 ten-minute intervals**. Most actions a party would take, like searching all the furniture in a room for valuables, dismantling a trap, or breaking down a door takes roughly 10 minutes

**The Reaction Roll**

When the party first encounters a group of creatures or NPCs, the DM rolls 2d10.

Find the result on the reaction table appropriate for the Player Characters’ posture relative to the creature(s) and the context of the encounter.

2d10 result descriptions:

**Friendly:** The creature(s) or NPC(s) has a starting attitude of friendly for social interactions and will generally help the players with minor tasks or provide information.

**Indifferent:** The creature(s) or NPC(s) has a starting attitude of indifferent for social interactions, and may leave, help, or harm the party depending on what is in its best interest. Depending on context, this can also mean an indifferent creature is cautious, suspicious, or threatening.

**Hostile:** The creature(s) or NPC(s) has a starting attitude of hostile for social interactions, and will threaten, taunt, or may attack if they think they have the upper hand.

**Aid Party:** The creature(s) or NPC(s) has a starting attitude of friendly for social interactions and assists the party with major tasks or at major risk to themselves, within their power to do so.

**Attack Party:** The creature(s) or NPC(s) are considered hostile for social interactions. When outside of civilization, they immediately attack or mean to harm the party on short notice. Within civilization, the party has made an enemy of the creature(s) or NPC(s).

[The Reaction Table \(2d10\)](https://preview.redd.it/dph3iyknwu3a1.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=000385d96e55cdcf7bb15ce4a84743fd524434c6)

&#x200B;

**Old School Initiative**

**Step 1: Declare Actions** Each round, all combatants must select and declare an action. NPC and monster actions are not declared.

If the **Cast a Spell** action was selected, and the caster is hit before the spell is cast, the caster must succeed on a concentration check or lose the spell.

**Step 2: Roll Initiative** The players roll a d20 for their initiative as a group, or side. The DM also rolls a d20. Neither roll receives any modifiers. If more than two sides take part in a battle, each side rolls for initiative. Sides act from the highest roll to lowest. In case of a tie, keep rerolling until the tie is broken. When it’s a side’s turn, the members of that side can act in any order they choose. When it’s a combatant's turn to act, they may move their speed as normal, but must take the action selected, or no action at all. Once everyone on the side has taken a turn, the other side goes. A round ends when both sides have completed their turns. Combat continues by declaring actions and rolling initiative at the start of each round until the battle is complete.

**Play Report:**

I play tested these rules for a one shot. We rolled up characters in 15 minutes, which was only that long because of spell selection. The fighter took less than 10 minutes to roll up, about the same as a B/X character. So far, so good. The party: Dwarf Cleric (4 hp), Halfling Wizard (1 hp), Human Fighter (11 hp).

The game began in town, the party signed up for a delve into a ruin a few miles away. The party reached the dungeon entrance, and the game began. Without skills, the players instantly began figuring out how to get passed the stuck stone door without a skill check. They've played BECMI before, so they understood the basics of interacting with the fiction.

As an homage to Mentzer basic, their first encounter was a Carrion Crawler (CR 2), eating a corpse in a 4 way intersection. I rolled its hit points, and when the party was close enough, a reaction roll. Hostile.

Combat went quickly, The carrion crawler smacked the cleric with it's tentacle, who saved vs paralysis (CON save). Then the cleric attacked, a crit. As in B/X, I rolled morale when it was hit for the first time, a 5. It took off around the corner, and hid in some rocks. The party continued onward. Every 10 minute interval, I rolled for a random encounter (18+ on a d20). This time, it was a 19.

4 kobolds patrolled the corridor, and the party was lit up by a light spell on the wizard's staff. Reaction roll, and it's hostile again.  The kobolds went to investigate. The party waited to meet them.

HP is rolled, init is rolled, and it's a kobold slaughter as the party wins init. 2 kobolds die in the first attack. Morale check, and the kobolds are out of there. The party pursues. The cleric throws his mace, and kills another. Firebolt from the wizard, and that's 4 kobolds dead. The party loots, the cleric heals with his first spell slot, and continues.

2 kobolds are sleeping in the next room, did not hear the sounds of combat (WIS check DC 10). The party enters quietly, and slits some throats. They loot a nearby chest, only a few hundred silver.

The next room is an octagon filled with sarcophagi, and the target room of this delve. The cleric suspects a skeleton ambush and suggests they go back to the pile of rocks that the carrion crawler went to hide in to get something heavy to block the central sarcophagus from opening.

The party doubles back, and here's where things get nasty. They return to the 4 way intersection and the wounded carrion crawler is back feasting on the corpse again. The party decides it's time to kill the poor bug. Reaction for the crawler, and it's pissed and out for blood. Init is rolled, and the carrion crawler wins. Tentacle attack against the fighter, hit. 4 points of poison damage. Fighter fails the save, and it's lunch time for Mr. Crawler. The carrion crawler finished its multiattack with an auto crit, a whopping 9 damage. Down goes the fighter, instant save vs death, and it's a 5. RIP, fighter. The remaining members start wailing on the crawler, and get lucky with back to back actions. The crawler dies, and a wandering monster check is rolled due to combat noise. Nothing.

Back to the octagon room, ""forget about the pile of rocks (and potentially more carrion crawlers),"" figures the party. Good call.

They manage to open the central sarcophagus, and nothing happens. I roll a CR 2 treasure hoard since that's the highest beast they'll fight. I add a magic sword for good measure. Good loot, with the total GP value of around 515, not enough to level the two party members. But they still have yet to pick anything up.

The Cleric assumes something's up. The other sarcophagi are still closed. He ties a rope around the sword, walks back to the corridor leading to the room, and yanks on the rope. The sword is pulled out of its place and the other sarcophagi begin launching poison darts in every direction in the room. Well done Cleric.

Not wanting to take the loot and run (rookie mistake) the two party members continue. They find an illusory wall hiding a catacomb. Bones on the floor, alcoves empty. The party begins looking for secrets and a ghost comes out of the wall (reaction roll: indifferent) and watches. Seeing the ghost, the party places the bones into the alcoves of the catacomb instead of rummaging for coin. The ghost is pleased and decides not to end the party's lives today.

Last room, 4 more coffins, skeletons in the coffins with runic marks carved into the skulls. The cleric wants to know if he recognizes the marks, and he does (because he's a cleric, and these are unholy runes, no roll required.) He begins attempting to remove the marks. my wandering monster check comes up 18. 1d4 (2) skeletons approach from the party's rear, and they're trapped in the room. The shut the door and jam a dagger into the hinges to buy time. The skeletons are stupid, and start banging on the door.

After a while, the party decide to open the door, cleric takes a swing, then the wizard will slam the door again as they enter. The initiative rolls work out, and the Cleric takes the jaw off of one skeleton, but it's still standing. The Wizard slams the door shut again. One skeleton tries to bash the door down, but with 1 hp, he just breaks himself upon the door. The wizard opens the door again for another attack, but the skeleton wins init this time. It swings its dagger and the cleric is hit. 4 damage. Cleric goes down, death save: 3. The Cleric dies.

Only the Wizard is left standing, and she uses her last spell slot (the first was mage armor) on a magic missile. Good damage, but not enough. The skeleton swings, and misses. Init again, wizard wins. Firebolt, max damage. The skeleton dies. The dungeon is inky black, as the source of the light spell has died. The halfling manages to escape, came back with *Floating Disk* prepared and snagged the remaining loot managing to avoid further encounters.

The wizard is the sole survivor, but got enough loot to attain level 2.

**Conclusions:**

Was it exactly like B/X? No, but close enough to see that 5e shares substantial DNA with the classic TSR games. With very light modifications (the 10 minute turn and reaction rolls can be just dropped in) and existing variant rules, 5e can indeed play and feel like proper TSR D&D. Moreso than I was expecting after lots of threads on the subject. Felt good to get my hands dirty and put the rules to the test at the table.

Player power as far as damage output is much higher in 5e ...but monster HP is also much higher. The Carrion Crawler HP average is 51 hp, and could (and nearly did) wipe the floor with a 1st level party generated with 3d6 and rolled HP. Luck was a factor in the party surviving. When they got bold they got punished, just like TSR D&D.

tl;dr: 5e does an admirable job at TSR style D&D, much better than I expected. I suggest trying it with these rules and see what you think.

My own FANTASTIC Weekend at Gary Con!,"Inspired by [u/Megatapirus](https://www.reddit.com/user/Megatapirus/), I figured I'd write up my own report about the games I played at my VERY FIRST GAME CONVENTION!!!

I went to Gary Con for the first time and I had an absolute BLAST! It was my first con ever and I couldn’t imagine a better way to get introduced to them. During the con I made sure to keep track of which games I was playing, how long they lasted, and other notable items. Below is my breakdown of it all! 

TLDR at the bottom.

# Game 1 - Wednesday - Goons & Ghosts - 1h 30m (DM)

Along with my conning companions Jesse and Elliott, I kicked off the gaming early. As soon as we took off from Denver International Airport we had dice rolling! We rolled up pals rolled up characters and I ran them through one of the game’s pre-written adventures.

This was my first time playing or DMing Goons & Ghosts, but it’s been on my list for a while. JP Coovert’s adaptation of Nate Treme’s Tunnel Goons was easy to pick-up and play, and made the flight *fly* by! We finished after we had to put tray tables up and they were rolling dice into the dice tray I held in my lap.

Also, as I boarded the flight I saw a dude in an Old School Essentials shirt. I asked him if he was going to Gary Con and (surprise, surprise!) he was. It turns out it was Luke Stratton, also known as Limithron, the creator of Pirate Borg! This was kind of *bonkers* since one of my pals was signed up for a Pirate Borg game later in the week and was excited to try it! Sadly, he had to get some work done so couldn’t join our G&G game.

# Game 2 - Thursday - Avatar Legends - 3h 20m

I’ve never tried Avatar Legends before, though I had backed the Kickstarter, and was excited to give it a shot. My first time playing a Powered by the Apocalypse system as well.

This was a game I played with Elliott and it was so much fun! We had a great group at the table and our DM, Eric Wallace, was especially engaging and it was easy to play off his energy. I played an earth bender and it was great to get into some shenanigans as we were chased through the forest by some nasty fire benders!

I would absolutely want to play or run Avatar in the future, and really this makes me want to try more games that use the PbtA system.

# Game 3 - Thursday - Shadowdark RPG - 3h 50m

YESSSS! It was time for some Shadowdark! This was one of the few tables that Jesse, Elliott and myself were able to get into together, but not only that, it also was being DMed by Steve Winter who used to work for TSR and had written a ton of stuff for D&D and other games!

This was part one of a three-part adventure, so we actually turned our character sheets in after the game so his next group could pick things up from there. I’m not sure if I loved that idea, and it didn’t help that the game started pretty slowly. It was a sort of point crawl through a forest and we did a lot of nothing it seemed like. Other group members didn’t have much interest in role playing, so what could have been some interesting encounters ended up being killfests. 

We took a short bio-break mid-way through the game, and once we got back things started to pick up and it really turned things around for me. We even ended up coming to a pretty decent conclusion of our first act.

The highlight of this adventure was playing with Steve. He’s got a big personality in the best of ways and was really open to our ideas as a group. It didn’t feel intimidating at all to be playing with him which is what I was a little concerned about. It’s also great to see that he’s into Shadowdark!

# Seminar 1 - Thursday - Running Successful Kickstarters

Folks representing Legends of Avantris, Troll Lord Games, Penny Dragon Games, and Frog God Games were all on this panel, and I really enjoyed it. It was interesting to hear they all had different stories to get where they were, and the questions that the crowd was asking illiciated really helpful responses. I’ll definitely be tweaking some of the strategy for my upcoming kickstarter based on what I learned here!

# Game 4 - Thursday - Goons & Ghosts - 2h (DM)

One of the reasons I wanted to play Goons & Ghosts on the plane was because I figured it would be a great game to run for a pickup game. I think *everyone* in this group was from the Shadowdark discord group. I think some of them had never played an RPG that wasn’t some form of D&D before.

I know I keep saying this (and I’m sure I’ll keep saying this), but it was a BLAST! Something I found out about myself is when I DM at a con, I apparently just stand the whole time. This is not the case at home games! We got into some real wacky ghostbustin’ shenanigans and ended up clearing out the haunted library. I had people telling me for the rest of the con how much fun this was, which was a great feeling.

# Game 5 - Friday - Shadowdark RPG - 3h (DM)

This was my first time running a Shadowdark game for mostly strangers. The adventure I was running, Aulon Raid in the Temple of order, is one that is going to be available as the preview of my upcoming Shadowdark zine *Attack the Light.*

Only one guy at the table had played Shadowdark before, and that was only one session on day one of the con. I had three dudes named John at the table (two of which were father/son), and another Mike, which I think was just funny. I think they had a good balance of combat, exploration, and roleplaying, and I felt like we wrapped things up in a pretty satisfying way.

# Seminar 2 - Friday - Fem Facing in TTRPGs (and Kicking Butt)

This panel featured Banana Chan, LaTia Jacquise, Sarah Moore, and Toni Winslow-Brill, 

with AJ Winter moderating. I thought it was so interesting hearing the stories from each participant on how they got here, and some of the bonkers things that they’ve had to go through as women in the industry.

The biggest moment though was during the Q&A when a man who I *know* I recognized from Secrets of Blackmoore or somewhere else like that prefaced his question with something along the lines of, “I’ve never played D&D, but I have been playing role playing games for 50 years, and this is what we dreamed of way back when. This is the future of our hobby, and you are the future of our hobby.” Lots of tears happening then by the panelists and the audience, including yours truly.

Later in the week I spoke with Banana Chan a bit and they are so fucking rad.

# Game 6 - Friday - Shadowdark RPG - 1h 15m

This was a short sesh being run by Doc from the Shadowdark discord and pretty much everyone was from the discord as well. Kelsey, the creator of Shadowdark also played in it. It was really cool to see her in action. More on that later though.

I’ll be honest though, I spent a good amount of this game chatting off to the side with Kelsey’s wife and then going on a coffee run, but I did enjoy it when my character awoke from a drunken daze to find a giant spider crawling on top of him! It was also fun having characters of all different levels doled out by Doc. This worked better than I would have expected, but since it was such a short game, there isn’t really as much at stake.

# Game 7 - Friday - Shadowdark RPG - 1h 30m

Another game with Doc as the DM and played along with Elliott and Jesse. This time it was a game on the books. Doc used his DMing methodology as he did in the previous game. I liked this one a bit better though since it was in a smaller group and I wasn’t distracted by being so social.

# Game 8 - Friday - Shadowdark RPG - 1h 30m

This was a late night session where Jesse was running the gauntlet that he is writing for *Attack the LIght.* Again, we roped in mostly people from the discord and facebook pages. I had played a previous version of this gauntlet before, but we took a totally different turn from the last session and had some surprising results! If I remember correctly, I died on the very last round of combat, and only one of us survived. A perfect gauntlet.

# Game 9 - Saturday - Wanderhome - 2h 45m

I was invited to a Shadowdark game that Kelsey was DMing during the same time that this session took place. I’ve been really wanting to try Wanderhome for a while now and was really torn over it. After having been through the session though, I am 1000% sure I made the right decision!

Wanderhome is a storytelling game that doesn’t involve any dice rolls or anything like that. You just make decisions and talk them through with the other players and the GM. We had three people playing which seemed like the right number, And the GM, a woman named Liz, was *excellent.* She had just the right balance of guiding the story herself and letting the players take charge.

In the game you play as anthropomorphic animals in a peaceful and pleasant world however, there are still remnants of a long-forgotten war that can be found from time to time. In our story, we were trying to figure out what had happened to the Story Worms who had gone missing from the Forest of Stories. It turned out they retreated to the dark section of the forest to go through the painful but necessary task of spinning books that were full of pain and agony. One particularly poignant book my character read was a diary of a young man who had been sent to war and saw it as pointless. Of course, the diary was never finished. 

We decided to take these books and bring them back to the world because, although it was difficult, these stories were still important and might help prevent something like a war from ever happening again. It was fucking awesome.

# Game 10 - Saturday - Shadowdark RPG - 2h 30m (DM)

Another session where I DM’d my Aulon Raid adventure! We had one no-show, but I think we still had a good time. Three of the four had never played Shadowdark before, and one of them, Kevin, had DM’d it twice and played it twice. They were all looking to learn more about running the game, so I took extra care in explaining the mechanics behind what I was doing with morale checks and things of that nature.

Two of the players were a bit disengaged, but the other two guys were great roleplayers and into it. I even killed my first player. He rolled a SEVEN on the death timer, but *nobody* could heal or stabilize him in time so he just bled out. The Aulon Raid adventure is based on a song by The Mountain Goats, and one of the guys wore a Mountain Goat’s shirt because of it!

# Seminar 3 - Kickstarting it Old School

This was another BIG one on my list of things to get into. The panel consisted of three creators in the OSR scene who ran BIG Kickstarter campaigns last year: Ben Milton, Gavin Norman, and Kelsey Dionne.

Ben had a bunch of stats that he had compiled with a researcher to track the growth of OSR games on Kickstarter in relation to 5e projects and RPGs in general. He’s going to put out a video about it soonish it sounded like, so I won’t spoil that, but there is some serious momentum behind OSR games in the crowdfunding sphere.

They all took questions as well and I learned even more things that I’ll be applying to my next kickstarter campaign. The three were also super gracious to hang around signing autographs and such afterwards.

# Game 11 - Saturday - Shadowdark RPG - 2h 45m

This was the session I’d be waiting for since tickets went on sale. Kelsey and Doc from the Shadowdark discord DMed the game together and the table had eight players. They were using a special zine sourced via the discord community that we all got copies of after.

Kelsey DMed our half of the table for the first half of the game. It was honestly one of the best sessions of D&D I’ve ever had. Elliott and I were together on a team along with Kevin from the game I had DMed earlier and another fellow. All four of us really dove into a bit of roleplaying silliness on our quest to find a pair of angel feathers and reunite them to be granted a wish.

Halfway through the session, Kelsey and Doc were scheduled to switch groups to DM for, however, Kelsey started feeling ill and had to go back to her room. I could tell the folks on the other team were super bummed, but I know she’s working out some way to make it up to them.

Doc took over for the whole table and I think did a really fantastic job. The finale ended up with our team pitted against the other team, which I didn’t love so much because I felt like by beating up on that team it was making them feel bad, but in the end, on a final roll, their player rolled a nat 20 for a 19, but our player rolled a 19 for a 21. The only fair way to do it was that the two players combined the feathers together to each get a wish.

As my team was deliberating what to wish for, I obviously had to suggest the wish be that Kelsey’s tummy got better. Once the other team got wind of that, they DOUBLED the wish. We all recorded a video to send to Kelsey wishing she would feel better, and I think it worked!

# Game 12 - Saturday - Shadowdark RPG - 2h (DM)

I was bullied into running a late-night pickup game that we got started around 10:30pm. I chose to go totally random using my own tables from *Blades & Heart* to randomize things and pieces of the Aulon Raid temple to fill in as a dungeon. Again, this was a total blast. Most of the group I hadn’t played with yet as we just kept meeting more and more Shadowdark fans.

The party ended up battling a Goblin Litch with scores of zombie guards. With the use of some wacky randomized magic items, they were able to defeat the baddie by the skin of their teeth.

I didn’t get to sleep until after two on this night, but it was totally worth it.

# Game 13 - Sunday - WHPA Fairhaven (Weird Heroes of Public Access) - 4h

I’ve had this game on my radar for a while now and I was so stoked to see someone was running a game for it! The premise is that the players are all hosts on a Public Access TV station and also you sometimes have mysterious powers.

I played a smarmy, full of himself news anchor. We were on the hunt to uncover the mystery of some missing kids in town. It turns out that it was SASQUASH ALL ALONG! Good thing I was able to be temporarily possessed by an Aztek warrior when the shit hit the fan.

In all honesty, I absolutely loved this game. It’s just the right amount of weird, wacky, crazy, and rules-lite to turn all my knobs in the right ways. 10/10 would play again.

# Game 14 - Monday - Goons & Ghosts - 1h 30m (DM)

While the con itself may have officially ended on Sunday, I stayed in Chicagoland to spend a day with my aunt and two uncles. They had never played an RPG before, so I ran them through a G&G adventure and they had a blast. My one uncle who has always loved acting and the theater especially took to it.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Gary Con was a blast. I played in over 33 hours of games across 14 sessions during the trip and DMed six of them. I thought the three seminars I attended were all hits. I met a ton of people and made friends and just got really energized to continue creating in the hobby. 10/10 I would do it all again, hopefully next year!

First OSR Experience,"So, I finally managed to get my roommates (sometimes my players) to sit down and try Basic Fantasy last night. It went far better than expected! 

For the first game, I ran a module from the Castle by the Sea book that Basic has. The quest itself was a rescue mission. Two kids had been kidnapped by skeletons and probably (most definitely) taken to the abandoned castle on the coast from the starting town. 

I won't get into specifics, as I'm just here to report a moment that was what highlighted the experience for all of us. So, the lead skeleton has this horn which brings the dead back. The castle itself was full of zombies, skeletons, etc. Anyways, the skeleton needs the children, particularly this one boy, to blow the horn for him to raise the dead and build an army. The boy does this as the skeletons tells him that he will kill his sister, who is also imprisoned here, if he does not. 

So, after nearly dying multiple times, the party discovers themselves in a room where the girl has been caged. Multiple attempts, which failed, to free her result in them searching the room more closely. On the wall, they discover the horn. They don't really question it, or the girl, and assume it is just treasure. At this point our magic-user had expended his one spell, and wanted to regain it. This led them to the wonderful idea of sleeping in the room with the girl (no idea why they did this). So, of course, during their rest they are interrupted by skeleton guards who are on patrol. Almost all of them. At least twenty. I feel bad for doing this, but I felt it made the most sense and they needed to now not to sleep in the occupied castle. However, this is where things changed. 

For whatever reason the fighter's first instinct is to throw the damn sack of what they found, including the horn, which I didn't know yet out the windows behind them. They're planning to jump (yes, they would die). Initiative is rolled, and of course, the skeletons go first. The room is rather small, though, and only two skeletons are able to walk around the cage with their speed and actually attempt to hit. 

They both miss. The party goes next. 

The fighter declares he will be attacking the skeleton in front of him, the magic-user is just waking up, and the thief decides to pivot oil at the door. Rolls a 1d8, and an 8 was rolled. I'm not sure how it works in other systems, but Basic (which I know is pretty close to an exact clone) has the area next to the impact also be infected by the thrown oil. Rolls 1d6, it's a 6. 

It's at this moment I come to a realization and look to my fighter. 

""What was all in the sack you tossed?""

He tells me a mix of: blah, blah, blah, the horn, blah, blah. 

If the horn is damaged, in any way, everything resurrected with it goes back to being dead. 

So after that turn it happens, and the fire is left being for 40 minutes. They leave. 

It was such a tense moment that I was 98% sure they were going to just die from, but I was proven wrong. The funny thing is, they think the skeletons that didn't die from the fire just died from being cut off from an arcane source (not too far off), but they have no assumption that it was the horn at all. 

If you read all this, thanks! I tried to be concise, but many details were important to convey the weight of the moment.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11faebdd0>,osr,1707938161.0
Keep on the Borderlands: Session 2 & 3,"Sessions 1-3 all written up on my [blog](https://thegibberingblog.blogspot.com/), full session reports for 2 & 3 here though.

To catch everyone up: Snoh (Magic User 1), Boulder (Fighter 1 - formally named Rokan), Grignak (Thief 1), Hortus (Cleric 1), and Keld (Dwarf 1) had enlisted the help of the jovial priest, Malros, in the keep to launch an attack on the caves (despite the warnings of the Curate). Predictably, Malros betrayed them and it was only a lucky hold person scroll that kept them alive and they were able to drag Malros back to the keep and turn him over to the Castellan who threw him in prison. They looted his apartment and were able to rent it from the jeweler (who I decided was also a landlord).  
  
Returning to the caves they found that the hobgoblins and goblins had brought in wolves and dire wolves to bolster their defenses because the goblin ranks had been decimated. They ended up in a pitched battle and were able to hold the stairwell in room 17, beset by hobgoblins from upper levels and the remaining goblins from the east. The goblin king, already out of favor with the hobgoblins due to his previous losses, died in the battle (there was a cool moment where Snoh tried to use Charm Person on the Goblin King but it unfortunately failed). The hobgoblins pulled back from the stairs to regroup and the party fled east through the caves to get some space between them and the hobgoblins.  
  
After looting the goblin king’s room they used the secret door to the ogre cave to lay low until they could quietly creep away from the ravine and head back to the Keep. On the way they were beset by 8 bandits who tried to shake them down for a 60 gold toll (10 gp per person). After 1 bandit lost his life the rest agreed to let the party pass.  
  
Back at the Keep, Snoh and Boulder decided to visit Malros in prison. Their plan was to press him for information. Malros told them that there was a bloodstone gem set in the mouth of a snake, a pendant, that his mother had given him and he wanted it back if he was to die. In return he would tell them everything he knew about the caves.  
  
They had found the bloodstone gem among his things and secreted it into the prison. Malros took it and told them that there was an evil temple in the upper levels of the caves. He claimed that if they could secure some small comforts he may even be able to make them a map.  
  
The two heroes went back to the Castellan to see what they could bargain for on Malros behalf, but the Castellan informed them that it was impossible and that the evil priest was to be hanged. They also learned that he was the follower of a vile snake cult and at that moment realized what they had given him (a holy symbol). They confessed their deed and rushed off along with the guard to the prison to see the damage they had done.  
  
Malros, upon the arrival of the guard along with Snoh and Boulder, whispered something to a crow outside his prison window and it flew off (speak with animals). He smiled and surrendered the holy symbol. Snoh and Boulder were thrown into the cell with Malros for the night until the Castellan decided what their punishment should be and Malros execution was moved up to the next day.  
  
Snoh and Boulder bribed a guard (200 gold and a charisma check vs. morale) to summon their retainer Grignak the thief. Grignak attempted to pickpocket a guard for his keys (literally rolled a 100), was caught, and was thrown into a cell adjacent to them.  
  
That night (1am) there was a commotion in the Keep as orc archers were shooting at the ramparts. Thinking that they might be under siege the guard mobilized leaving just 2 guards in the prison. A stranger slipped a staff through the bars of the prison window and Malros convinced Snoh and Boulder to attack him.  
  
The two remaining guards opened the cell door to break up the fight and Malros used a Staff of Snakes to kill the first guard while Snoh and Boulder attacked the second. Malros finished off the second guard and turned to escape, but realizing what they had effectively done, Snoh and Boulder picked up the guard’s swords and attacked Malros. Snoh was knocked out quickly and Boulder was constricted by the Staff of Snakes. However, a random encounter check (2) brought two more guards who blocked Malros escape. Another random encounter check later (another 2) and three more guards showed up. Three guards were killed, but so was Malros. Grignak, in the adjacent cell, testified that Malros had planned the entire escape and that Snoh and Boulder had tried to stop him and save the guard’s lives. The partial lie was successful and the “heroes” brought once more before the Castellan who explained all the events of the night appeared to have been a ruse for Malros’ escape.  
  
The Staff of Snakes was given to the Curate Borus who was going to perform a ritual that night to destroy it. Once again, greed got the better of Snoh and Boulder who decided they needed to get the staff for themselves. Using a potion of invisibility (found in the ogre cave in the first session), Grignak sneaked into the chapel while Snoh and Borus loudly created a scene in the street at 4am claiming that they needed entry because the staff was going to be stolen. The guard showed up, thoroughly annoyed with this duo by now, and threatened to put them back in jail for disturbing the peace and began escorting them back to their apartment.  
  
Inside the chapel, Grignak successfully sneaked to the alter (invisible) while the curate prayed before the staff to destroy it in a holy ritual. However, he failed another pickpocket check and the curate Borus rose in shock as the staff seemingly floated off the altar. Grignak ran and the curate cast detect magic, causing him to glow.  
  
Initiative check. If they won Grignak would make it out of chapel and out of range of the curate’s detect magic. If they failed, the curate had a hold person with Grignak’s name on it. They won (4 vs. 2).

Grignak disappeared into the dark of the early morning and the curate ran out into the streets yelling that the agents of the Snake Cult had stolen the staff. The guards, still with Snoh and Boulder (giving them the perfect alibi) rushed back to the chapel upon hearing the curate's yells.  
  
The next morning the Castellan summoned them once again, explaining that dark powers in the cave were stronger than he expected and evidently even within the walls of the keep.  He doubled the reward promised to destroy the evil altar in the Caves of Chaos.  
  
They tested my improv skills during those sessions, but it was a good time. It turned into a very Pirates of the Caribbean plotline where they continued to fail forward in spite of their own bad decision making. Kids, even more than normal D&D players, are psychopaths.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fb2b410>,osr,1719277126.0
An 8 Year Old in Arden Vul using AD&D 1e," Had some time yesterday to hangout with my Son and started him running a party of five into The Halls of Arden Vul.   

He is looking for the source of some strange poisonings and ended up in the basement of a ruined building in the Old city. 

The first room held the corpse of a Cleric and Fighter where he found a strange potion right before 4 giant centipedes attacked.  He popped off his M-Us sleep spell and slew them after the ranger gained the party a surprise segment.  

His fighter pushed threw some old rusted double doors and was attacked by more centipedes  as he tried to get through.  Luckily there were misses and a save so he was able to warn the party who ran back outside.  The fighter was able to make it out in the remaining segments and I did not think the insects would follow outside their nest.  

The smart little 8 year old decided the ranger would try to find a rat or some mammal to use as bait at the door.  I decided a roll of 1d8 per hour would allow him to spot one which he made on the first roll.  The ranger passed his tracking test, his hit roll to grab it and the party went back down.  The plan was to toss the rat through the double doors, have the thief toss in an oil vial once the biters swarmed the rat, hope it would break and then to have the M-U toss in a lit torch.  

I required all rolls and the kid passed each toss, the vial did not make its crushing blow save and 13 centipedes had swarmed out of the 16 left.  The fire killed all but 2 insects before they reached the party where one bit the fighter who passed his save again (+4 saved him per the module), while the M-Us attacker missed.  

It was time to do chores so he made it back to the inn north of the city and we ended.  He does not know there are 3 left that will swarm when he tries to enter back into those doors so well see if he gets crafty again or risks it next time.

"Play log: The Sky-Blind Spire, session 1","Played this last night with my group, using B/X with a few house rules. PCs are:

* Brigette - level 3 dwarf
* Drashi - level 3 dwarf
* Garamond - level 3 elf
* Nogge - level 4 fighter
* Notgandalf - level 3 magic-user

Significant hirelings:

* Fingers - level 3 thief
* Tarlan - level 2 cleric

I used some of the ideas about the sky-blindness [from my post 3 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/1agomvd/skyblind_spire_describing_the_skyblindness/). Thanks to everyone who commented on that post!

Also note that in this log the tower levels are numbered 2 higher than the numbers given in the adventure, because my players came up with their own numbering scheme based on roughly three floors below with no windows. (edited post for some typos)

**Swirling Rumours: Neensford to Benton**

Towards the end of their training period, with the weather turning from summer into early autumn, a travelling merchant arrived from the east, bearing news of import: The great wizard **Titardinal** had died! Titardinal was known for having a secluded tower a week's ride to the east, past the village of Benton. The party gathered to share what rumours they'd previously heard about Titardinal. They augmented this by asking around the village for anything that anyone else knew.

* Titardinal? Crazy old coot. They say he went off the deep end and built that tower all by his lonesome up by the lake.
* They say the lake spirit cursed the wizard for his arrogance, twisting his tower into a maze of madness. Those who enter never return the same.
* They say the undines imprisoned within the tower’s fountain are not as innocent as they seem. Some claim they hold the key to unlocking the tower’s secrets, while others warn of their vengeful nature.
* Rumours swirl of a secret chamber hidden beneath the lake’s surface, accessible only to those who know the right incantations. But tread carefully, for the spirits of the deep do not take kindly to intruders.
* There are those who claim the wizard’s tower holds the key to great power, but it’s guarded by creatures of nightmare. Only the bravest—or the most foolish—would dare to enter.
* There are rumours of a secret entrance to the tower, accessible only during the full moon when the barriers between worlds are weakest. But those who seek it must first navigate the treacherous cliffs surrounding the lake.
* I’ve heard tales of a hidden library within the tower, filled with ancient tomes and forbidden knowledge. But beware, for the books themselves are said to be cursed, driving those who read them to madness.

Questioning the merchant revealed that the news had travelled slowly. Titardinal seemed to have vanished several months ago, but nobody had carried the news to Neensford before now. The party decided that a recently deceased powerful wizard's tower should contain many treasures and potentially magic items, and was worth investigating.

They equipped themselves with two wagons for transporting the party (Brigette, Drashi, Garamond, Nogge, Notgandalf) and their retainers (Fingers, Tarlan, and 5 other journeymen adventurers), plus four horses to draw them. Nogge bought a riding horse for himself, not wanting to ride in a wagon. They journeyed six days to the east, up into the foothills of the Black Peak Mountains, to the village of Benton. Here they paused to refresh themselves from time on the road, and approached the innkeeper to ask about Titardinal:

* Rumour has it Titardinal was head over heels for the Spirit of the Lake. Built his tower smack dab by the water just to catch her eye, they say.

Titardinal's Tower still lay a day's travel to the north-east, up into the Black Peak Mountains. They travelled up the narrow track and made camp near the pass that gave access to a valley with a beautiful blue mountain lake, surrounded by slopes covered in pine, cedar, and fir trees.

**Approaching Titardinal's Tower**

The next morning dawned clear and sunny. From the pass, the party spied out the land below. On a small tied island attached to the near shore of the lake rose a circular stone tower, narrow, about seven storeys tall. No door was visible from the pass, but four floors of widely spaced windows could be seen making up the upper four floors of the tower, above a smooth section below with no windows. The battlement on the roof was partly crumbled in places. As they watched, a large white pelican flew from the lake up to one of the lowest windows, perched, and ducked inside. Another pelican emerged from a different window at that level and flew off to forage.

Also visible from the pass was a small encampment on the shore, about half a mile from the tower, by a stream emptying into the lake. A dozen or so small humanoid figures could be seen occasionally, scurrying under a large sky-blue tarpaulin set up as a shelter. Goblins! The party deliberated dealing with the encampment first, to ensure no surprise attacks from behind while exploring the tower, but decided to tackle the tower first.

> Nogge: All I'm saying is it could come back to bite us in the butt.

> DM: So you're setting up an ""I told you so"" for Nogge?

> Nogge: Right.

Rather than take all the retainers and the wagons down to the lake, where they might be seen by the goblins, they instructed the retainers to set up camp in the pass and wait there.

> Drashi: Equals sign the wagons.

> All: Huh?

> Drashi: You can't circle them. There's only two.

> Nogge: You'd need an infinite number to make a circle. We need three or more to even make make a polyhedron.

> Brigette: Poly*hedron*? Just how mountainous *is* this region?

They approached carefully in the brush, avoiding making themselves obvious to the goblins. Fingers scouted around the base of the tower, reporting that there was a large double door on the far side, facing the lake. He also said the lock had evidently been broken.

The party pushed open the doors carefully, revealing a ""welcoming"" hall decorated with iron gibbets hanging from chains, containing skeletons. They carefully probed the skeletons with poles to make sure they weren't undead, then ratcheted the chains down to examine them more closely. They found a **silvery ring** on the bony finger of one skeleton. A search of the room also turned up a pewter scroll case which contained an old sheet of parchment with a letter:


> Most Esteemed Titardinal,

> I beg of you to reconsider this mad project of yours and return to my side as my most trusted advisor.

> (Signed) Duke Trayko of Verge.


**The Madness of Titardinal's Tower**

As they stood in the reception hall, tiny motes of sparkling light appeared and attached themselves to each party member, circling above their heads. These appeared harmless, and not bright enough to explore by, so the group lit torches and lanterns and progressed into the tower.

First they tried a passage to the south, which led to a square room with floor length tapestries on each wall. The passage they emerged from was hidden behind a blue tapestry showing the lake. Other walls contained a red tapestry showing a mountain scene, a yellow one depicting a desert scene, and a green one with a scene deep in a deciduous forest. Notgandalf, drawing a map, expressed confusion as, according to the pacing out of room sizes, this tapestry room should be *outside* the southern wall of the tower. Brigette suggested it was some wizard shenanigans and the tapestries actually transported people who stepped past them to different locations. So the tapestry room itself was not within the tower, but somewhere else, and if one were to step from the room past the blue tapestry they would be  transported into the tower.

They decided not to pass beyond the blue tapestry, but retreated to the entrance hall and tried the other exit, an arched doorway with a wooden door that had fallen off its hinges. This led into a dismal cell, with manacles and shackles.

> This Titardinal really didn't like visitors, did he?

In the cell, a second spark of light joined the first around each adventurer's head. And they noticed a brass symbol inset in the floor, a number ""2"". Quickly they went back and checked the floor of the welcome hall more carefully, finding a long, straight strip of brass set into the floor, which they now recognised as a numeral ""1"". This prompted some experimentation.

Nogge, accompanied by two sparks, went to look at the tapestry room again. Pulling the blue tapestry aside, he spotted a brass number ""18"" on the floor. He decided to enter the room, pushing past the tapestry. When he set foot inside the room, the two sparks around his head vanished. One returned when he re-entered the welcome hall, and a second when he went back into the cell. The party surmised that sparks would accumulate as they traversed rooms in numerical order, but would reset to zero if they ever entered a room out of sequence.

Now they continued exploring. An open passage from the cell led to a north-south corridor with five other openings on the sides. They tried the south-east one first, revealing a cell numbered ""23"". This cell contained windows, and they could see that they were no longer on the ground floor! Going in to check, they saw the eastern window was on the 5th floor of the tower (with one window below them and two above). There were also heavy, rusty chains dangling down from the window above, and down from the sill to the window below. The other window, in the north wall of the same room, appeared to be looking *south* from the 7th floor!

Now the party realised what madness Titardinal's Tower held.

**Deeper Exploration**

The group quickly checked the other cells along the corridor. The south-west was labelled ""6"", and had another passage leading west. The central west cell was ""5"", with no exits. The north-west cell was ""4"", and had a window in the north wall, which appeared to look west on level 5.

Next they tried along the corridor to the north. This opened into a large room covered in muck and guano, inhabited by **giant pelicans**, taller than a human. Nogge carefully took a step into the room to see if he would attract a third spark, but the two around his head vanished. He concluded this was not room number 3, but a pelican took unkindly to his intrusion and attacked! Nogge beat off the giant probing beak and smote the pelican with his magical two-handed sword, driving it back into the foetid rookery.

The final cell, in the north-east, turned out to be room ""3"". People collected a third spark as expected, and Nogge returned to the welcome hall to reassemble his as well. Cell 3 also had a window in the north wall, looking west from level 6. As this was directly above the window in cell 4 directly across the corridor, they tried stationing one person at each window at the same time to see if they could see each other by looking up/down, and they could. The group concluded that at least it was only spatial weirdness going on, and not time shenanigans as well.

Then they traversed rooms 4, 5, and 6 to accumulate 6 sparks each. The other passage from cell 6 led them north-west up a set of stairs to a circular room with exit passages north and south, a window north-west, a brass ""7"" in the floor, and a large fountain in the middle. Could this be the rumoured fountain of the undines?

As Brigette approached the fountain, **ghostly shapes like young children** appeared in the water. They saw the sparks about Brigette's head and merged into a **serpent-like shape** that stretched from the water to attack her! Brigette yelled to stop attacking, that they were here to help them. The **undines** paused, and asked why they had the sparks; they were doing the evil wizard's work! Brigette conversed, trying to convince the undines that the party meant no harm. The undines revealed that Titardinal had trapped them in the fountain to power a devastating spell to ""destroy everything"", and the sparks were part of it. They begged the party to ""destroy the altar"" so that the spell could never be completed.

The group discussed ways to free the undines, including siphoning the water out the window and smashing the fountain to spill the water. But the undines said they were trapped here magically and the only way to free them was to destroy the altar. They asked the party to swear a solemn oath that they would do it. When Brigette swore, they presented her with a sword from the fountain water, saying it was the sword of the Lake Spirit.

**What Madness is This?**

The group decided the right thing to do was to return the sword to the Lake Spirit as soon as possible. They retreated out through the cells and the entrance hall to the front door of the tower, seeking to gaze out on the lake. They pulled the doors open warily, half-expecting the camp of goblins to be waiting for them. But there were no goblins.

And there was *no lake*.

The beautiful blue mountain lake had vanished. All they could see was mountain slopes lined with green trees. Everyone stood dumbstruck for a minute.

> Nogge: That.... is the last thing I expected.

Brigette walked forward carefully, probing the ground with a pole. After several steps the pole indicated the edge of the lake and Brigette walked forward, getting her feet wet. The lake seemed to be there, but none of them could see it. Brigette placed the sword in the (unseen) water and called to the Lake Spirit to accept their offering. But after several minutes, nothing happened and the sword was still there - Brigette feeling for it in the unseen water.

She decided to strip off her armour and swim out into deeper water. Others suggested tying a rope to her, since nobody could actually see the lake, to avoid her getting lost. This done, Brigette swam out and dived with the sword, attempting to offer it to the Lake Spirit. But after some minutes of this to no avail, she gave up.

As she dried off on the shore of the lake they could not see, they discussed the mysterious illusion before them. How did this happen? Why was the lake hidden from them? What time was it? They looked at the sky.

*They couldn't see the sky.*

They saw stars in inky blackness. But the sun was up - it was dazzlingly bright in the sky, they could feel its warmth, and see the shadows on the ground around them. It was daylight, but the stars were out.

They concluded that if the Lake Spirit was too distant or too busy to take the sword, they would just have to go back into the tower and try to find and destroy the altar.

> Drashi: Good thing it's still daynight.

**Finding the Altar**

The group returned to the fountain room, not bothering to collect sparks by traversing rooms 3-5. They told the undines what happened as Fingers scouted the corridor to the south. He returned and said it led to a dining room with a couple of **giants**, twice the height of a person, sitting on the floor, grumbling and playing cards at the dining table. The window here looked north (as determined by the sun) from level 7.

The passage north led down a stair to a square room with exits in all four walls and the number ""8"" on the floor. Old paintings were hung on the narrow walls between the exits. A window in the west wall revealed the view from the level 7 northern window. They determined the passage east led downstairs to the pelican room. Nogge feared the pelican room would be room 9, but the number was hidden under the muck and guano and it would be impossible to find without killing all the pelicans. He did an experiment collecting sparks to test this idea. He returned from the entry hall with 8 sparks and stepped carefully into the pelican room, timing it when none of the pelicans was looking his way, and collected a ninth spark.

Having proven this, they proceeded north from the art gallery room, descending into a landing before a wide staircase leading back upwards. Large alcoves in the east and west walls housed evil looking human statues. A brass number ""13"" was set into the floor. The party climbed the steps to an intermediate landing, with more steps leading up to the north to a similar looking landing with statues. But here in the middle landing there were narrow passages leading east and west.

They chose the eastern passage, emerging in a crypt containing a stone sarcophagus, engraved with a magical looking sigil, and a brass number ""14"" in the floor. Stairs led up to the north and down to the east. The eastern stairs led down to an L-shaped room ""15"", which appeared to be the bottom of a cess pit, with a mound of rotting food refuse, filth, and dung, below a shaft that ascended from the ceiling. Two **giant flies** that were buzzing around the muck attacked them but the party took care of them with some swift sword blows. The group didn't fancy trying to climb up the reeking shaft to reach what they expected would be room 16, so they retreated to 14 and took the stairs north.

This led to Titardinal's study, with a desk and bookshelves, in disarray and clearly partly searched through by someone. The floor was labelled with a brass ""22"". Notgandalf perused the books, looking for anything magical. Fingers hushed everyone and said he could hear voices and shushing noises. He indicated a corner where the noise was coming from, and said he recognised goblin language. He translated, ""Shhh, stay quite and they won't notice us.""

Notgandalf cast Detect Magic, but this didn't reveal anything, except a **couple of the books** still on the shelf, which he grabbed quickly, and the ring that had been taken from the skeleton in the entry hall. Nogge and Brigette advanced on the corner of the room and poked ahead of them with the sword blades. Suddenly one noticed resistance and a voice cried out in pain! **Goblin** voices called out and disembodied arms wielding swords appeared out of nowhere, charging the party!

The goblins fought bravely, perhaps thinking they had the advantage, but three were cut down by swords and Notgandalf's Magic Missile, and Drashi, wielding the Silver Axe of Sir Wylt, sliced clean through the arm of the fourth, dropping the arm and sword to the floor. Tarlan located the screaming invisible goblin and pulled an invisible cloak off it, revealing the now armless creature. He applied some bandages while others found the other bodies and removed invisible cloaks from them as well.

They questioned the goblin, who claimed to be from the Rikalu tribe, the ""best goblins, better than the dirty Flivven tribe"". He said the goblins in the camp would make short work of the party, for not only did they have warriors but also a mighty shaman. The party debated, and decided they couldn't let the goblin flee to inform his comrades, so they put him out of his misery.

Brigette tried on one of the ""invisibility cloaks"" and discovered to her dismay that she couldn't see anything while under it. ""What use is a cloak of invisibility that you can't see through?!"" They also realised that the cloaks had not detected as magical to Notgandalf's spell. Nevertheless, they bundled the invisible cloths up and took them.

Among the mess in the study they found several architectural drawings, showing apparent alternative layouts for the tower rooms. They all showed numbered rooms, and described the final room 24 as being the altar room. Furthermore, the window in this room looked east from level 6, directly above a window in the cell room 23 they had already visited. They surmised they were meant to climb down the chain from 22 to 23, and then out the other window from 23 to reach the altar in room 24.

Notgandlaf actually wanted to climb down the chain directly to 23, but the others decided to just walk back the way they'd come through the rooms. They reached cell 23 to find Notgandalf waiting for them. Looking out the other window, on level 7 looking south, they noticed it not only had a chain dangling down to whatever unknown room had the window on level 6, but there was also a chain leading up to the rooftop. This seemed intriguing enough that they despatched Fingers to climb up. He secured a rope at the top to tie to people to avoid falling, and the rest of the party clambered onto the rooftop.

Here they found an 8-foot square **stone altar** placed on the crumbling roof, with carved magical sigils on the sides. Set into the stones of the rooftop was the brass number 24. This was the altar the undines wanted them to destroy!

> Brigette: I gently stab the altar with the undine sword.

That did nothing. They tried chipping away at the magical sigils to deface them. Brigette and Drashi, using their dwarven stonecunnning, determined that the altar was not attached to the roof, and could probably be dragged or pushed if enough people were available. They estimated about ten people would be needed to shift it. And perhaps they could push it off the roof and let it smash on the ground below. They considered using ropes or levers, but there was no simple way to arrange this to gain a mechanical advantage.

The seven of them weren't strong enough together to shift the altar. But they had five retainers waiting for them back at their camp in the mountain pass. The group sat to consider their options...",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fa7bcb0>,osr,1708761737.0

Holmes' Sample Dungeon with the Kiddos,"**Play Report on Holmes ""Sample Dungeon."" Spoilers below!**

&#x200B;

I’ve learned that as the DM you can’t take your game more serious than your players, so I grinned when my two sons (7 & 13) rolled up their adventuring party (3d6 in order) and we ended up with Snohtu (the last character before our break was Snoh so this was literally Snoh-Two) the Illusionist, Pat Fuste the Bard, Fine the Fighter (pronounced “Feen-ay”), Snap the Elf, Krackle the Cleric, and Pop the Thief. They hung out in town for a few minutes, but we knew we only had a couple hours to play so they were quick to jump on one of their first two hooks, rumors that a nearby ruined tower was once again inhabited by a malignant force (Holmes “Starter Dungeon” or the “Tower of Zenopus.”)

**Note:** They do their own mapping, we do torches, and we combat in the open (I announce to-hits needed).

They dove right in, went north, and listened at the first door they encountered. Silence. Pop the thief successfully rolled a sneak but used a torch to poke his head in the door and caught the attention of two grotesque hunched figures (ghouls) amongst scattered broken coffins. Fine and Pat Fuste were immediately paralyzed and Snap charged into melee. Krackle turned one of them, but it was looking grim.

**DM Ruling:** Could Krackle Turn again? I had already established that to keep something turned it required concentration so I ruled that he could try but if he failed the already turned ghoul might be… un-turned? He tried and failed.

Fine was down to 1 HP, Pat Fuste was down to 3, and Snap was down to 2. Snohtu tried to cast Phantasmal Force, which is a gray area for me (undead and illusions) but he said that he was simulating a cave in. I figured even our lizard brain (which ghouls seem to have - hunt, eat, etc) would try to avoid falling rock so I had them roll vs. paralysis and they both saved anyway.

Krackle turned again and this timesucceeded, giving them some breathing room. Some lucky rolls for thrown daggers, slings, and a couple sword strikes laid the ghouls low. They looted the room (550gp in platinum and gems) and decided to press their luck deeper.

They were done listening at doors after that fiasco and adopted a strategy of kicking the door down and bum rushing into the room. They hit two empty rooms like this before their next encounter. Lucky for them, neighboring rooms were NOT PAYING ATTENTION (I don’t think I’ve ever rolled more 5s and 6s on listen checks in my life!)

>!Note: The Sample Dungeon in the back of Holmes basic is keyed absolutely ridiculously so I made an error. Instead of them busting into G which is full of Giant Rats, I had them bust into F which has a 4th Level Magic User and a charmed 2nd level Fighter. Taking a quick 2 minutes to reorient myself I decided that instead of retconning it I would swap G into where F was supposed to be, no harm no foul.!<

So they bust into the room with the magic user and fighter and have a brief argument over if they are going to fight or parlay. They meet in the middle and confirm with me that since its surprise and they just bum rushed into the room it is NOT combat yet. Then they hit me with it, the Pat Fuste the bard starts playing his pipe like he’s the Pied Piper.

The Fighter, who is already charmed, drops his sword and grabs his head as the two magics clash in his brain, the Magic User makes his save. The magic user then wins initiative and blasts Pat Fuste with a magic missile (7 damage!) killing him outright.

On their turn, Snap the Elf goes nuclear and fires off Sleep, putting everyone in the room (friends and foes) to sleep except for himself, because he’s an elf. Encounter over.

I’m using the Dolmenwood death thing so Pat Fauste makes his death save and Krackle uses his healing potion on him (I give level 1 clerics a free potion of healing since they don’t get spells) and he is back at 1 hp (but he has permanently lost 1 con).  They score a scroll of levitation, a +1 magic sword (they don’t know it’s magic), and a 1,000 gp belt.

All in all a successful little 1.5->2 hour slot (especially since we also rolled up characters). We ended it there and our party is 4 rooms deep in the dungeon. North of them are skeletons, south of them are giant rats. Let’s hope they choose wisely because this is where we currently stand:

Pat Fuste the Bard: 1 hp, lost 1 con

Fine the Fighter: 1 hp, now has a +1 sword

Snap the Elf: 2 hp, no more spells

Snohtu the Illusionist: 5 hp, no more spells

Krackle the Cleric: 5 hp, no more potions

Pop the Thief: 4 hp

Treasure looted: 1,550 gp.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fb7c980>,osr,1698021621.0
Game Log: Into the Drudeglade (an OSE One-Shot in Lamordia),"Ran a one-shot of OSE for a couple of my 5e buddies the other night, figured I'd drop a little summary here for any interested parties to read.   


First up, character creation. Party was made up of two players -- a human knight, and a warforged assassin (couldn't find an official version of the warforged for any old-school system, so I just did a quick write-up for him). Started 'em out at level 5, had them roll for stats 5e-style (4d6, drop lowest). They each ended up with decent stats, both of them rolling 2 +2's, so they were in good shape.   


I also gave each of them two talents from Scott Wegener's Glaive 2e, because I adore that system and what it tries to accomplish. Human knight got a bonus talent, on account of not getting any fancy racial traits. I know OSE gives humans some optional traits, but I didn't want to overwhelm them. Used Carcass Crawler issue 2 to roll up some gear for them, and we ended up with a human dual-sword knight in full plate named Sir Aramis Donovan (honestly couldn't believe his luck on the gear rolls), and a calibite sniper assassin designated OSE-5, Five for short.   


Adventure took place in my homebrew version of Lamordia. I use the map of Lamordia that came in Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft, because I love that map, but that's about all I took from that version of the domain. (No disrespect to the writers over at WotC, I just wanted to go a different direction with it.) The bulk of the setting I rewrote myself, based mostly on snippets from Adam's Wrath as well as my love of Shelley's original novel. Unimportant for the one-shot, but I do have some stuff in the works there that I would love to expand upon someday.   


\---   


The adventure starts in Neufurchtenburg, where our party works auxiliary for the town guard to keep the wolves at bay. The town's mayor, Haming Neufurchten, calls them into his office to discuss a matter of some urgency with them in private; the town is running out of medicine, and a trading caravan will not reach Whale End or Ludendorf in time before a crisis has a chance to begin. With no other option, Mayor Haming intends to send the two north to the Drudeglade to request aid from the fabled Braufrauen. The Braufrauen are said to be powerful witches, capable of commanding the beasts of the woods and concoct potions that rival the magic of the dead gods, exiled from polite society as Lamordia rejected the arcane arts in favor of advancing the sciences. Mayor Haming has seen fit to try and mend relations between them... though perhaps his decision is just out of desperation.   


The boys are given a calibite tundracarrier (basically a mechanical horse and cart, crafted using the same crystal-based design principles devised by the young Dr. Eva Mordenheim which gave Lamordia its version of warforged) to help carry supplies back, as well as the aid of two young scouts, Hildi and Gerbi. They set off up the White River, and they're on the road for about two days before they reach their crossing.   


On the way, they swap stories about their adventures; Five did some work in the past as a bounty hunter out in Ludendorf, but why he made his way out to Neufurchtenburg is unknown. Sir Aramis, brash and brazen as he is, does love to spin a tall tale or two about monsters and great battles that most of the town is sure never truly happened, but it lightens the mood nonetheless. Gerbi does his best to convince the party that he once caught a glimpse of the Protean Man out in the wilds, but everyone knows the Protean Man is a myth.   


They reach the river crossing, and they set up camp on their side of the bridge. Not much bothers them as they settle in, though Five does stumble upon a nest of crocodiles. They don't seem to bother him, just minding their own business, so the party goes into their shifts for the night watch. Aramis and Five get through their shifts without incident.   


About 4 in the morning, Gerbi wakes the boys up. He sees something at the edge of the water, just poking out from under the bridge. Everyone immediately gears up and prepares for a fight. The scouts, while inexperienced, stand ready at Sir Aramis's side, clearly inspired by his stories and his bravery.   


The thing by the bridge lurches out of the water on two legs. A hunched-over, haggard shape that they just can't quite make out in the darkness. It lifts its head... and Hildi slumps to the ground without a sound. As the thing scrabbles off into the water, Sir Aramis checks the young scout, and it's no good. Whatever happened to him, Hildi is dead.   


The party retreats into a patch of wood they'd crossed through earlier, to hunker down out of sight until sunrise. Steeling their resolve, the party proceeds once they have light. Crossing the bridge (where Sir Aramis scares off a few oddly-oversized ants), the party crosses into the fabled Drudeglade forest, and find it corrupted, sick for reasons unknown. Not many people dare to travel into the Drudeglade these days, but if this is what magic does to the world...   


Someone appears just off the beaten path. A young woman wearing a full cloak and a wide-brim hat. She's surprised to see men in the Drudeglade. Sir Aramis steps up and explains the situation in Neufurchtenburg, and after a moment's deliberation, the woman agrees to take them to the Braufrauen.   


The day is still new when they reach the village, but the sun shines amber-gold through the trees. The village is warm and snow-free, and the sweet smell of mead fills the air. The lady takes them to the leader of the Braufrauen, who calls herself Grandmother Rosamund.   


In reality, the Braufrauen are not witches at all! They're simply exiled medicine-makers who live in the Drudeglade for protection from the cruelty of civilization. Their treatment methods were perceived as magical by the populations of the past, but were passed down from Braufrau to Braufrau over the years. There is clearly magic in these woods, but it doesn't come from them. They're just excellent physicians and herbalists. (They also make an outstanding mead from the honey of the Drudeglade's giant bees!)   


That's not to say that witches aren't real, however; the Braufrauen have been plagued by a coven of hags encroaching on their territory, and will ask the party to help them deal with this nuisance. If the party accepts and deals with the witches, the Braufrauen will be happy to provide medicine to the people of Neufurchtenburg.   


The gang sets off with their guide (introduced to them as Junie) in tow, but are accosted by tremendous insects, centipedes the size of pythons. (They were supposed to be ankhegs, but I forgot what ankhegs were when I rolled on the encounter table, so I described them wrong. My players didn't notice, though, so it's cool.) Junie is visibly bothered by the attack; the beasts of the Drudeglade have always possessed intellect and reason, what's causing this terrible change?   


Either way, the creatures lay into the party, and very nearly slay their guide right there. Sir Aramis is ravaged by their acids, but with his twin blades, the knight gives just as good as he gets. To his credit, the rattled Gerbi gets a shot in as well, and the beasts turn to flee. After treating their wounds with healing salves, Junie guides the party further east, towards the place where the Drudeglade's scouts last reported an encounter with the hags.   


As a cold, overcast afternoon creeps upon them, the party come into a gruesome clearing. Trees have been mangled and ripped down, bark and charred wood arranged into intricate circles spanning a large swath of open, scorched land. In the center of the circles sits a thatched mound surrounded with stones.   


Five, the calibite assassin, steals away on his own to search for a better vantage point. Settling in the brush on the edge of the clearing, he tosses a stone into the circles. Out of the mound crawls a massive gaunt figure, some ten feet tall with blue-black skin and long, oily raven hair obscuring its features. It casts its gaze around, turning each direction to investigate the noise...   


And Five takes a shot with his repeater. Admittedly, I forgot to account for the creature's Hit Dice being too high for the Assassination skill, but the player nails the attack, and the hag fails its save, so its head indeed pops like a bloody zit. Screeches echo through the forest, and the air seems to uncoil around them, like a breath exhaled slow.   


Gerbi leaps up out of hiding in his relief, and he turns to give a smile to Aramis... when he sees something behind the big man, and drops dead on the spot. Aramis doesn't hesitate, and cuts down the hag behind him with two quick, angry blows (he had two attacks on account of the Professional Killer talent from Glaive). Five collects the big hag's iron teeth, and the party returns with Gerbi's body in tow.   


As the party crosses the bridge from the Drudeglade on their way back to town, now laden with enough medicines to get Neufurchtenburg through the winter, Five spots something on the edge of the treeline. The massive shape of a man, covered in a tattered cloak and raven hair, watching them with piercing golden-yellow eyes...   


Perhaps Gerbi wasn't lying after all.   


\---   


And that's where the session ended. Just a one-shot to tide us over until we could meet again next week for our regular 5e game, but it was SO nice to finally get this one-shot done! I'd been itching to jump into Lamordia for ages, and wanting to try OSE with an actual group for almost as long! All in all, we had a blast, and I'm really hoping that my guys hang onto their character sheets so we can do this again sometime.

So..my players are making a cart out of a bunk bed. (Dungeons of Aubermont S2),"Welcome back to my amateurish play reports from my game! Today my players returned to the dungeons of Aubermont. First, though, they went to the keep on top. The keep of castle Aubermont WAS inhabited by some bandits, who my players provoked through the portcullis, and soon after met and fought with with the help of some dwarves who were trying to break open an old safe (They were called Thorin, Oin and Gloin ;)). The elf managed to sleep all of them before anything significant happened, and they found a treasure riddle in the castle library which bent their minds to their limit...sorry guys... Anyways, they followed the riddle about halfway and sort of just happened to come across the end point by going in the right way a bunch of times, lol. Now, this hidden treasure is \~17000 silver (a large mistake on my part...too much treasure for 2nd levels! I will probably tone it down behind the screen.). Now, i thought they would grab some, hire people to come down with them and go grab the rest later on, but no. What they do is...grab a bunk bed from the adjacent barracks and attempt to attach wheels to it with the help of a magical forge that i rolled on a special room. It's absolutely completely absurd. I love it. They plan to attach it to their donkey (bingle) and call it 'The Binglemobile'. We left off in the dungeon because it's getting late now and people have to go home, but god i wish we'd finished this. Next session...you'll all see...",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fa17a70>,osr,1696189901.0
Hot Springs Island - impressions after the first session," 

Hi! We started playing **Hot Springs Island** and I thought you might be interesed in reading AP about how your fellow players from distant Poland had fun ;)

In my head I have a report focusing on what was happening at the table, how the game (we were using Five Torches Deep) / module was played and used. This form seems to be useful ""cognitively"" for the readers, but it will not spoil the module itself (the interjections of what happened in the fiction may appear as examples rather than a description of the scene by scene).

The two most important conclusions from yesterday's playing:

**It was beyond my wildest expectations how useful was Field Guides for HSI**. It was great to have a session where players, instead of asking ""*ok, what my character knows about this tree or about this creature*"", imposing on the MG the task of exposing the presented world, could simply check all these things in a guide written from the perspective of an inhabitant this world. And it's not that I don't like to make explanations - but thanks to all that Field Guides on board everything was much more natural, more organic, what's more - my ""decisions"" as to what to describe and explian did not automatically turn into tips or hints for players, so - we did not lose this adventure-OSR spirit of thinking, combining and uncertainty whether all the information in the Guide is true.

**It worked great that every person playing had their own physical guide**, and used it a bit to check what was this thing or what the characters on the monolith mean, a bit as a notebook (although post factum we agreed that they lack a dedicated section for notes ""from the journey""), and a bit as tips ""*what flowers to look for if I want to heal a companion*"" or ""*what can steam imp do to us*"". Thanks to this, everyone was very immersed in the world - such a handout worked great, especially since it did not only serve as a help with one puzzle or a nice gadget, but **actually influenced the game and decisions made at the table**. What's more, because everyone uses it in their own way, painting, writing down and adding ""their stuff"" to it, it will be a great souvenir at the end of the campaign. And the stories from the game world - in the form of entries from the journals of previous explorers - are really nice written, well ""inspiring"" to play. The guide also inspired them to make their own props with notes of their characters - I hope I will manage to add ;) the photos showing a sample of what was created after session 0 and 1.

We also have one guy, who started playing with us, for whom it was the first session in his life. Not only an OSR-style game with a sandbox open module, but in general - **the first play of any ttrpg**. And it was once again when I was convinced that this style of playing - let's call it adventure-old school - is very compatible for the begginers with what the ""average person"" thinks about RPG and simply intuitive. It is different with the running the game (in my opinion, GMing in OSR requires a few non-obvious, but still easy-to-develop skills), but **you can just play this way from the go and immediately ""catch"" what's going on**. Instead of learning five different special abilities from class, race and culture, three feat trees, or complex structures for using moves in a playbook, the player can simply ""go out into the world"", explore it on their own and follow whatever interests them, and rules will follow him without tying his hands. No ""scenes"" planned in advance, no complicated story arcs and no proper pacing to ensure that everything sounds sufficiently ""dramatic"". Sure - playing that way can also be fun, but I think that is also intimidating for new people and hard to get hold of. I also have the impression that this is not the way people talk about ttrpgs ""on a daily basis"" and that is not what many people expect when sitting down at a table with expectations raised from ""mainstream "" culture (but - maybe it is diffrent in Poland).

As for the story - in the first session, the characters found some cool places, managed to steal a magic spear from a NPC of large faction on the island, get bitten by carnivorous plants, explore the ""enchanted stream"" and stumble into some ancient ruins and monoliths. They already have a specific plan - to visit and collect treasures from the ruins of an elven resort in the south of the island. The ""sandbox powder keg"" gains potential and waits for its spark.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fb92f30>,osr,1647272335.0
Wolves Upon the Coast - Session #11 — Mac Makes Things,"The Brimuxi's crew goes raiding on behalf of the people of Sicara. While the regular squabbling betwixt our various, shall we say ""strong-willed"" crew members occurred as it does, the job itself went off without a hitch! 

This will be my last recap for awhile as my personal schedule has made it difficult to continue playing with this group for the foreseeable future.  Everyone was kind enough to turn this into a pickup game, so there may be some intermittent updates when we're able to get together.  Thanks to everyone who's been reading and following along, it's been a lot of fun!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fb7fe30>,osr,1690339973.0
"Tomb of the Serpent Kings, session 3","* Session 1 recap is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/10z6d5c/tomb_of_the_serpent_kings_session_1/
* Session 2 recap is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/11oavcl/tomb_of_the_serpent_kings_session_2/
* Maps that Notgandalf's player made, updated to include session 2: https://imgur.com/a/kHAeyWH

At the end of session 2, the party had returned to their village without any fatalities. For session 3, Volrak's and Ratter's players were absent. So Volrak was still doing penance for annoying his god, and Ratter had actually earned enough gold to level up as a thief, so he was spending time training with the village's most notorious thug. Ratter also found that his drained Constitution slowly healed back.

We had one new player join the game. They rolled up **Brother Leonardo**, a cleric (with Strength 4!). He joined **Drashi** the dwarf, **Garamond Wrenwobbler**, the elf, **Nogge** the fighter, and **Notgandalf** the magic-user.

In the village of Neensford, Notgandalf used Detect Magic to determine that the stone eggs, snake carving, and wavy dagger retrieved in session 2 were magical. The group traded away the other valuable items for 390gp, sharing 65gp to each participating adventurer. They rested for three days. Notgandalf suffered another effect of the curse on his magical ring, taking poison damage on one of the rest days. (He has been really lucky making saving throws vs Poison for this ring! Failed only once so far out of six saves.)

The party picked up some more gossip and rumours in town. There were tales of more sheep from the outlying farms going missing (raided by the fungus goblins from the Tomb, unknown to them). Also a merchant had come from the town of Brandonstead, three days travel north on the edge of the civilised lands below the wild mountain range. He recounted stories of livestock being raided there too, and rumours of goblins, or perhaps some more horrible monster come down from the mountains. The reeve of Brandonstead has offered a reward to anyone who could take care of the problem. (This is sowing the seeds of my next planned adventure - **The Black Wyrm of Brandonsford**, although I tweaked the name to avoid my players stumbling across it online.)

The party returned to the Tomb.

**Room 12:** Convinced that the giant lizard chained in the pillared hall was a basilisk, Notgandalf was determined to retrieve the electrum disc from the lightning trap room. He avoided the floor plate trigger and tried to remove the electrum plate from the wall, with some trepidation over whether it would zap him or not. It seemed harmless, so he pried it loose with a dagger and took it.

**Room 38:** The party returned to the eastern end of the basilisk chamber via the chasm walkway. There, Notgandalf taunted the beast with a torch and waved the shiny reflective disc in an attempt to get it to see its own reflection. Unfortunately this failed, and the beast continued to snort and slither noisily.

**Room 37:** They decided to explore down the stairs to the south-east, finding a square room with similar stone tiles to the ones covering the pit trap they'd pushed the jelly-skeleton into (Room 25). Poking the tiles with a 10-foot pole revealed the pit trap. Avoiding it by walking around the edge, they proceeded through the door.

**Room 30:** They entered this room, containing the sloped pit full of fire, with some charred bones and streaks of molten gold at the bottom. They were very wary of the fire pit, and elected to ignore the lure of gold. They skirted the pit and exited through the door to the south.

**Room 28:** The domed chamber with four doors. The southern door was heavy iron and locked. The western door was smashed open. They turned their attention here first.

**Room 52:** Beyond the smashed door was a passage and room with more natural, less-worked stone walls, and an angry small humanoid trying to push them back with a broom while chittering in an unknown language. (None of the party knew goblin, so there was no means of communicating other than gesture and action.) The party tried to push their way past, but the creature yelled loudly and two reinforcements arrived, brandishing pointed sticks. Others were ready to fall back, but Brother Leonardo impulsively loosed a sling stone, hitting one right between the eyes and dropping it to the filthy floor! The other reinforcement fled back the way it had come. The party forced the creature with the broom to come with them at swordpoint as they pushed deeper into the natural caverns.

**Room 50:** They came across a stinking chamber carpeted in muck and filth, with horrible fungoid growths, sickly plants, and other weird things apparently planted in the mulch: fingers, hands, sheep legs, sword hilts, etc. The stench was incredible. The party were very reluctant to step into this mess. While hesitating, a group of six of the goblins charged to repel the invaders! Entering combat, the party took a few hits with pointy sticks and pitchforks. Garamond took a nasty hit and retreated to avoid more damage. Notgandalf charged in and poked a goblin with the fang-like nail of his cursed finger, causing the goblin to clutch its throat and die horribly, foaming at the mouth. The group vanquished the six attackers, leaving their hostage gibbering. Leonardo healed Garamond. Notgandalf cast Detect Magic to scry the room for any magical items. He located buried beneath the filth a silver ring, set with a semi-precious stone patterned like an eye. (This was the magic ring from the black pool at map key 11, which I wanted them to find, but they seemed unlikely to ever want to dredge the pool, so I moved it here.) They found the north passage connected to the second entrance that Garamond had found on the previous expedition.

**Room 51 to 47:** The south passage took them through an empty room—a filthy sort of bed chamber—and then into a makeshift throne room, where more of the goblins were paying respects to an effigy made of mud and sticks, sitting atop a crude chair, crowned by a headpiece made of sticks and bent cutlery. Edging around the room, keeping the goblins at bay by threatening their hostage with a blade to its throat, the party exited to the west while the goblins stood back in fear. A passage led south to a room (48) that stank even worse than the previous mulch room. They avoided this and proceeded through a room carpeted with live beetles and cockroaches (47).

**Map ref 42:** North from here they found the passage blocked by a huge vertical cylinder of stone. The dwarves Brigette and Drashi examined it and suggested the stone cylinder might rotate around a vertical axis. They pulled it clockwise, revealing an opening in the stone large enough for a person to stand in. (I reduced the opening size from two people to one, thinking that would be more fun.) Nogge volunteered to step in while the others rotated the cylinder around a full rotation anti-clockwise, so Nogge could report back. Nogge returned, having been stabbed and wounded by a spear trap on the western side, saying that the way around on the eastern side was safe, and led to a passage that continued north. Leonardo tried to heal Nogge, but beseeching his god for an extra spell failed! One at a time the party used the cylinder door to proceed into the north passage. They noticed a stone idol carved into an alcove as the cylinder rotated to the east. (I'd given Nogge's player a note that the idol contained two golden bowls, and he indicated that Nogge took them without telling the other PCs.)

**Room 38:** The passage led up stairs to connect to the area Garamond had previously explored west of the basilisk chamber. Notgandalf used the opportunity to try to deal with the monster again, hiding around the corner,  taunting it with a torch, and holding the electrum disc to try to reflect its gaze. The monster noisily approached with hisses and the slithering clank of chain... and then silence fell.

> Notgandalf: ""Did it work?""
>
> Brigette: ""So... who wants to look?""

Brigette used the silver disc to look around the corner and see if the basilisk was still alive.

> Brigette: Actually, it's okay whether or not the mirror reflects the gaze attack. If it does reflect the attack, then it's probably turned itself to stone so you're safe. On the other hand, if the mirror doesn't reflect the attack, and it's alive, its reflection shouldn't turn you to stone.

It turned out the basilisk had indeed been turned to stone. (The adventure says the basilisk is immune to its reflected gaze, but I wanted to let the players have a victory with this attempt and this time it failed its save.) They noted the head harness and blinders, and a thick leather collar, as well as the heavy chains leading up to the ceiling, invisible in the darkness above, with the odd chittering of bats. Having a good look around the chamber for any treasure, they noted nothing but broken pieces of ""statues"", as well as extremely realistic stone bats, huge spiders, and a few of the fungus goblins. (I was hoping they might check the collar and find the hidden key to room 29, but they didn't.)

**Room 46:** Exploring the passage west revealed two doors, one intricately carved with multiple snakes, and a gap matching the shape and size of the stone snake found in the monster-girl room (32). Brigette replaced the snake and the party watched as the stone snakes animated and slithered into the door frame, revealing a portal to a magnificent throne room, lined with red stone, dusty tapestries, and eight palm-sized mirrors mounted on wooden frames, surrounding a heavy stone, wood, and gold throne. Notgandalf sat on the throne and was overcome with feelings of powerlust and ambition. He refused to get off the throne, so Brigette, Drashi, and Leonardo lifted the rear and tipped him out. They determined the throne would take three people to carry, and decided to come back to retrieve it before leaving the tomb for the day.

**Room 43:** The northern door opened to reveal a chamber lit with eerie purple light, the stone ceiling and walls carved to look like the inside of a snake's ribcage. A thousand various smells assaulted their noses: herbs, spices, acids, yeasts, flowers, etc. Standing before them was Xiximanter, a shrivelled, desiccated human torso and head with snake fangs, atop a skeletal snake tail. His sunken eye sockets glowed with red pinpricks of light. He greeted the party, asking which was to be his new apprentice.

> Notgandalf: ""Seems like a reasonable gentleman.""

The party conversed with Xiximanter, determining that he was seeking a new apprentice, as well as ingredients such as elf ears (looking at Garamond) and dwarf beards (looking at Drashi and Brigette) for his potions. The party asked if Xiximanter had any potion that could reverse magical ageing of 9 years (thinking to get it for Ratter), and he replied that he did not, but he did have something else that might be of use (the potion of longevity). Xiximanter ushered them into the adjoining room (44), full of equipment and storage jars full of weird ingredients. Another door led to what Xiximanter said was his laboratory (45), but he didn't allow them in there. Xiximanter often referred to ""the priests above"", making the party suspect he had no idea that all of the serpent people in the complex were long dead. They even suspected that Xiximanter might not know himself that he was undead. They debated telling him... but decided better of it.

Notgandalf asked if Xiximanter could remove his cursed ring. Xiximanter exclaimed, ""Where did you get that?!"" and cast a spell and removed the ring, returning Notgandalf's finger to normal. Xiximanter kept the ring...

> Nogge: ""You have fewer snake parts than when you came in.""

Eventually the party decided that getting away without angering Xiximanter was the best course of action, and they made excuses, saying they would return later. Their persuasiveness convinced Xiximanter to let them leave. They immediately jammed the door shut with iron spikes, grabbed the throne, and fled the dungeon back to Neensford.

**Room 29:** The party returned a few days alter after healing and resting, to check a final location: the locked iron door south of the domed chamber (28). Not having found the key, they used tools brought with them to laboriously pry the door open, revealing a room full of treasure! Piles of coins, rolled silk tapestries, a small chest full of jewels, and two fine swords - one sword detected as magical. They also quickly checked the walkway in the cavern, finding it blocked to the north and south. They grabbed all the treasure and raced back to town.

At Neensford, Notgandalf decided to try on the magical ring with the eye-gem. When he put it on his left hand, his left eyeball fell out! But he could still see through it! It also turned hard as stone. Putting the eyeball back into the socket, it reattached and he could remove the ring.

Now flush with gold and valuables, the party has enough for all of them to level up. After some resting and training, they will probably head north to Brandonstead as level 2 adventurers!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fb7f410>,osr,1682216141.0
Actual Play from this weekend,"Not sure if people read these, but this is the actual play report from my two sessions this weekend with my sons (11 and 6). We play a mashup of Knave, OSE, and Rules Cyclopedia. We started a new campaign, I thought I’d introduce them to Keep on the Borderlands and just set it in our established “world.”

Grokel and Snoh arrived at Cobefort on a sunny midmorning in early spring. Grokel had apprenticed as a chandler and Snoh had learned to fish with his father and brothers. Both left lives they didn’t want and had traveled north into the wilderness. (That’s how you do character backstory!)

After visiting Helga the smithy, Samesh the proprietor, and Gaston the furrier they realized that they were hungry for lunch and badly in need of coin. They pushed their way into Cobe’s Cup, the only tavern in the keep, and spent their next to last silver on some hearty stew and a pint of ale. Here they overheard some off duty guards arguing with some local drunks about whether it was monsters or a powerful wizard living in the caves northeast of the keep. Their last silver was spent on a room at Hayward’s Inn.

Early the next morning they decided to head up the Old Road toward the caves and cliffs they had heard brought both death and gold.  By late morning they had arrived at cave riddled cliffs. Cautiously they approached the nearest cave, Grokel lighting a candle before they stepped inside.

The passage split and Grokel went left as Snoh went right. Grokel had quietly rounded the first bend in the roughly worked corridore when he quickly extinguished his candle and came upon six goblins. Two sat at a table playing tiddlywinks with copper coins while the other four huddled around a fire roasting rats on sticks.

Grokel hefted a flask of lantern oil and tossed it in the midst of the four (natural 20!) three of them staggered shrieking about the room trying to put out the fire with their spears and ended up stabbing each other in the process. The other three had formed a defensive line to face off against their attacker. Grokel pulled out his sickle and looked worriedly over his shoulder to see if Snoh had heard the commotion. Fortunately, Snoh had quickly realized that he couldn’t see without Grokel’s candle and had already doubled back and was able to catch up to his friend. Two of the goblins threw spears at the adventurers which clattered harmlessly off the cave walls. The third charged and missed with his own spear. Grokel cut him down with his sickle.

“Stop! Don’t hurt us!” The two remaining goblins dropped to their knees (failed morale) and begged their attackers for mercy.

Grokel and Snoh had a momentary disagreement, Grokel winning. “Guide us to the treasure and you may join us.” (Successful charisma check)

“I Rot, he Gut, we RotGut. You new powerful chiefs. We help!” They pleaded. The adventurers and their new henchmen collectively known as RotGut looted the room. While searching the bodies another goblin rounded the corner, surveyed the scene, and immediately bolted back down the hall.

“After him!” Grokel roared and the adventurers along with their new henchmen gave chase. Snoh tried to ensnare the goblin in a net to no avail, it was Grokel’s thrown spear that fell the goblin just as it reached the door at the end of the hall Snoh had originally tried to explore.

Grokel burst open the door revealing another six goblins.  Three goblins immediately fell as Gorkel, Snoh, and RotGut let loose a volley of spears. One of the goblins heaved open a secret door in the back of the room and threw something inside, the other two charged Grokel. Snoh and Grokel fell one of the goblins, the other catching Snoh in the ribs with shiv. RotGut retrieved their spears. Then an eight foot tusked monstrosity wearing a bear carcass as a cloak burst into the room from the secret door in the back of the chamber. Grokel charged with his sickle, delivering a nasty slash across its chest. RotGut threw spears, both finding purchase. Snoh moved in to support Grokel. The ogre lashed out, Grokel’s knee cracking from a sweep of its giant club (0 HP, death and dismemberment). RotGut dogpiled the final goblin, beating him to death with rocks. Snoh was able to stab the ogre in the thigh with his dagger. Badly injured, the ogre looked about the room now devoid of the goblins which had paid him and stepped back through the secret passage slamming the door behind him (failed morale). Quickly looting the dead, Grokel, Snoh, and RotGut made their escape.

As they approached Cobefort around dusk, the guard stopped Grokel and Snoh. The guard would not allow RotGut into the fort (failed charisma). They gave RotGut their rations and told them to lay low in the woods. They found the Chapel of Paymore where a priest agreed to set Grokel’s knee for a majority of their looted coin. They spent what they had left on room and board for the week to recuperate. The next morning Snoh went to check on RotGut but they were nowhere to be found.

After a week (and some natural healing) the two adventurers set back out with a plan to hunt the ogre. They remained desperately poor but had convinced themselves that ogre must have more treasure than the goblins. The travel to the cliffs occurred without event and upon their arrival all was quiet. Grokel and Snoh approached the cave entrance that they had previously entered cautiously. Grokel had the idea to ring his bell at the cave entrance and see if he could draw anything out into the open. The shrubs and trees behind them began to shake violently. Grokel and Snoh heedlessly charged. The ogre had emerged from its concealed den and took a wild swing at them. It’s wounds too had begun to close from their previous encounter but Grokel and Snoh were able to best it. They looted its cave finding several sacks of coin, an ornate nesting doll, a silver triangle, a wheel of cheese, a keg of brandy, six strange wavy arrows, and a thin pink potion. Grokel immediately drank the potion and disappeared (invisibility). He took the opportunity to open the secret door and ensure that no goblins had moved back into the adjacent room, but was disturbed to find that the evidence of the previous encounter in the room had been cleaned up. Snoh struck the silver triangle (detect magic) and heard the nesting doll resonate, realizing that both were spells. They gathered everything they could carry that was silver, gold, or magic and secreted the bear carcasses, copper coins, and some of their gear in the ogre cave to return for later.  On their return trip they just barely evaded a swarm of giant bees, hazarding a quick detour into the marsh to the south before returning to the road.

Back in town they used their newfound wealth to better provision themselves (and gain a level!). Grokel bought some chain, a bow, and a warhammer. Snoh purchased a flail and a slingshot. They also bought a mule (Larry), a donkey (Curly), and a wagon. Snoh experimented with the nesting dolls and discovered that it was a shrinking spell which could make both Grokel and himself the size of mice.

The next morning they returned to the caves without event, collected the remaining loot from the ogre, and then decided to further explore the goblin caves.  Sneaking through some of the already explored portions they came upon a large room with over thirty goblins of all ages within. After a hushed discussion Snoh agreed to use their newly acquired shrinking spell to make them small and they would try to sneak through the densely packed common room in the goblin warren. As they snuck along the perimeter of the room they were attacked by a rat (which seemed like a giant rat since they were mouse-sized) but Snoh was able to dispatch it with a single hit (natural 20!). They continued across the room into the far hall beyond.

Grokel convinced Snoh to launch a surprise attack and they ended the spell. Grokel notched one of the magic arrows and it sunk into a goblin’s head (natural 20) but instead of dealing damage it appeared to be absorbed into its skull. That goblin and the four closest to it began shrieking in fear and ran out of the room in the opposite direction. Some of the younger looking goblins followed, but there was still twenty-five goblins in the room to contend with. The goblins had been eating, drinking, and doing whatever goblins do in their free time so many rocks, sticks, bones, and other refuse was thrown. Grokel notched another magic arrow but it missed, fizzling into the stone. Snoh dropped a goblin with his slingshot. Both adventurers were being pelted by refuse and beginning to reassess their plan. The third magic arrow drove another three goblins screaming from the room and Snoh crushed one that dared come into melee. By the time Grokel released the fourth magic arrow (only 2 left!) the number of goblins had been reduced by almost half and the rest broke into a frenzied retreat (failed morale).

Suddenly the door at the end of the hall burst open and two more well appointed goblins with bows began shooting at Grokel and Snoh. Grokel hit one with another magic arrow and it dropped to the floor quivering in fear. A third stepped in its place continuing the volley of arrows down the hall. Snoh and Grokel retreated back through the secret door into the ogre lair and escaped with Larry, Curly, and their wagon of copper and bear carcasses.

On the way back they encountered two fire beetles which were devouring a horse beside the road. One almost finished Grokel, but Snoh was able to finish it with a lucky shot from his slingshot. They collected the carapaces and glowing glands from the beetles and continued to the fort.

At the fort they sold the bear carcasses to the peltier and commissioned some stylish beetle helmets from the smithy. They spent the week in town healing and planning their return to the goblin warrens. For the return Grokel had a plan and they purchased three bear trips and enlisted the aid of two men, Fredo and Gusingo. Fredo and Gusingo had heard about the coin that Grokel and Snoh were spreading around and agreed to join up for a half share each. “We get rich together - yes?”

Packed and ready for another excursion; Grokel, Snoh, Fredo, and Gusingo headed off to the cliffs. On the road they encountered a wounded troll who implored them to let it go (reaction 12!). Grokel pressed the troll on what was wrong (successful charisma check) and they learned that some bandits had ambushed its bridge to the south in the marshes. They attacked with fire and stole its treasure. Tomey, the troll, barely escaped with its life. The adventurers offered to help the troll take back its bridge in return for half its treasure. Tomey accepted.

As they approached the troll bridge, which also had a squat two story tower, Tomey hung back still too wounded to fight. Grokel snuck up to the tower which the bandits had made their hideout and laid a bear trap and some lantern oil outside the door. He laid another bear trap at the end of the bridge and retreated to the other side of the bridge. Fredo and Gusingo took flanking positions on either side of the tower and Snoh snuck up, throwing a cask of flaming oil through one of the lower windows. The screams inside proved that their plan was successful and several bandits spilled out the door on fire. One succumbed to the bear trap and several others to the flames. Four bandits made it out of the tower but started getting picked off by Grokel, Fredo, and Gusingo. The chieftain charged Grokel in a rage but stepped on the second bear trap at the end of the bridge, easy prey for Snoh’s flail. One bandit made it to Fredo, giving him a nasty wound before Grokel took him down with an arrow.

Tomey gave them half his treasure as agreed (1,500 coppers and 2 gems) and the party decided to spend the night in the tower with their new troll ally.

And that is where we will pick up next session!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fba15e0>,osr,1643602195.0
Hero Quest with a 9 year old and his Grandparents,"Some of you all might have seen my previous post about acquiring the new edition of Hero Quest for Christmas. Well, today we cracked it open and I'm dutifully filling out my play report. 

Part 1: The Best Part of Hero Quest IS the Furniture

First off, as nostalgic as I am about the original, the build quality of the remake is WAY better. The models are more detailed, all the furniture is plastic (no more cardboard), and there are two layers of trays which makes keeping everything organized in the box way easier (I remember my original HQ was just an empty box with all the piece sloshing around like puzzle pieces.) So everything is way more sturdy without the cardboard, but the tradeoff is its all monochrome plastic (and I never got into miniature painting so. . .)

Anyway, as soon as my kid saw all the furniture his eyes lit up. And when he learned that the GM was the one in charge of placing said furniture in the dungeon, it was basically a done deal: he was going to be the GM. We reached an agreement - he would use the quest book to layout the monsters, etc. but was free to arrange the furniture as he liked. 

Part 2: Homebrew Madness

The lesson I quickly learned is that when you give a 9 year old a whole tray of furniture and like 25 miniature monsters, he's not going to play anything by the book. Within the first 5 minutes, the kid basically created enough additions to pen an expert level Hero Quest: locked doors; moving walls; teleporters; rotating bookcases; doors you could only open by answering riddles; rules for parleying with monsters. 

By the way, he quickly threw out the plot written in the questbook, after declaring it was ""boring"" and ""didn't make sense."" So, instead we were sent to find the evil wizard Zargon's secret weakness by locating the ghost of the good Zargon, who to my understanding was kind of like Evil Zargon's abandoned conscious? Anyway, the good Zargon was trapped in a chair (again-furniture is king in HQ), so we had to find a potion to pour on the chair to release him. We discovered Zargon's secret weakness was cake, because eating cake ""makes anyone return to good."" So now we're tasked to finding the ingredients to make said cake (that's right - he put us on a fetch quest). 

Part 3: Grandparents were overwhelmed

First off, props to the grandparents for volunteering in the first place. These are monopoly and gin rummy people, and they did have a rough go of it. They didn't understand why my son could ""break all the rules,"" and I tried my best to tell them this is the kind of game where ""you just have to roll with it."" They also had trouble coming to terms with the fact that the prescribed actions you can take according to the HQ rulebook just wasn't going to cut with my kid as the GM. 

I was actually impressed with his GM ability. As much as he joked that he could be cruel to us PCs, he wasn't. He really cared about seeing us through the adventure, at one point saving us from an overwhelming battle by dropping a chandelier on a bunch of monsters. He even had the wherewithal to mitigate the Deus Ex Machina-ness of the chandelier fall by explaining that ""Zargon cast a rust spell on the chain because he was dissapointed in his minions.""

Part 4: The Rating

5 out of 5. I thought I would enjoy it out of nostalgia, but the best part was seeing how much fun my kid was having. And woe be to all OSR games that do not include miniature furniture.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fb90d40>,osr,1672199441.0
Dirtbag teens in a weird costal town vs the Bayocean slasher[s] ...for LIMINAL HORROR,"I finally got back with my Sunday group to run the first delve into Bayocean (an in development campaign local for [LIMINAL HORROR](https://goblinarchives.itch.io/)).

Our four ""heroes"" start off in the middle of a good ol fashioned b&e (breaking and entering). 

It takes a turn from there: robbery interrupted by the owner coming home, leaving one of the party behind, hanging out in the quarry being up to no good, being chased by a slasher wielding the body of their “friend,” quick trip for hot dogs, a traffic stop gone wrong, being set up at the arcade, final stand at an abandoned house (and a fire trap), to party the next night only to have a new slasher after them.

What seemed like a straightforward slasher is something much more complex as the whistling figure seems to have manifested in a new body.

"Needs Must When the Devil Drives: Demon-Bone sarcophagus campaign, journal part two","[Demon-Bone Sarcophagus. Campaign journal part one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/11h1kla/by_demons_driven_session_1_of_my_play_report_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Demon-Bone sarcophagus Campaign journal part two. 

In which the shit hits the fan… 

So our protagonist Cade ( played by my awesome Friend and player) the professional, spy, and thief, showed up to the desert and witnessed utter carnage.

He had managed the improbably impressive feat of convincing an angry talking baboon, and a idiotic teenage patrolman that they shouldn’t immediately kill each other. 

In fact, he convinced each of them that the other one was just temporary muscle.

Tooth tooth and cade lower themselves on rope down to the floor of the Sloth wrecked room.

Examining the layout of the room he began searching for the ruby chips that he had seen from the surface.

… unaware that one of the Protection Men (black clad essentially clockwork magic enhanced cyber assassins) was hiding and observing them the entire time.

Suddenly, the door opens, and they stunningly, beautiful woman, composed of salt and radioactive chemicals stands before them.

After some extensive dialogue, she introduces herself as Navidorine. She informed Cade of some of the important facts about the Tomb of the Fire Queen.

That it was not just a tomb, but a prison for impossibly dangerous demons and their followers that were so terrible that they could not be killed without empowering the evil even further.

She informed them furthermore that, although she did not wish the demons to be released, she had been in this tomb far longer that she ever imagined, and wanted to go home.

Cade agreed to a binding oath to find her missing diamond heart if she gave him her tomb key. She cannot leave the tomb without it.

Having agreed to that, and with an increasingly frustrated Baboon, the party proceeds west to the library. As their gracious dryad host had indicated that she had heard a loud noise.

They came to the bedchamber, a room surrounded by stuffed marsupial bears. Including four mighty specimens, holding a bed on top of their head.

The obsidian assassin, a shape hanging construct able to take any shape that was shown in its mirror form was hiding flat in the bed, unseen by the motley group.

Until Cade and Tooth-Tooth climbed up to take a look.

Inside the bed for all the world was Tooth-Tooth’s boss Wensley Shrive!

But something was wrong… He was laying flat in the bed, holding a lantern, and a wand stiffly in front of him. 

And the moment Tooth-Tooth went to hug his boss ecstatically. The creature, changed it to a storm of shard of obsidian and cut tooth-tooth badly in a spray of blood…

Cade drew his glowing dagger and made swift work of the assassin.

And then the shards left behind on the bed, his trained thieves eye immediately spotted the black diamond.

During the battle the teenage boy, Vaguebob ( who I will continue to call Boy because voice text recognizes that) had applied life-saving first aid and a magical packet of blue powder to the brave baboons wounds.

Moving on to the next chamber, they discovered the Fire Queen’s arms.

Cade, ( with the help of his magical dagger) realized immediately that the armor and sword are magical. Totally coincidently fitting the height profile of the queen. He upgrades immensely with a suit of magic, played armored that moves like leather. And also immune to demonic magic with a single target.

The sword always does max damage, absorbs Cold damage, and shoot it back in the form of fire.

He gives Tooth-Tooth his old sword, which he is no longer using.

The brave baboon has definitely got a better attitude toward him since Boy saved his life and have now giving him a weapon. 

The next room is a Library filled with ceramic books in a language that no one can read.

Surprising everyone the southern door opens, and a cloud of metal leaves swarms into the room. 

Boreala, the Fall Witch has arrived.

Angrily, accusing them all of being demon worshipers, she immediately spots of the tomb key hanging around Cade’s neck.

She demands to know where he got it from. He says that he was giving it by a tomb guardian, and refuses to tell her the name. He is interpreting her lack of a key means that she is not actually a tomb, guardian.

She is. She’s just not entirely trusted and mentally unstable.

Enraged by his refusal she picks up the teenage boy after correctly, judging him to be the weakest link.

She proceeds to cut off all of his armor and pack in a spray of tiny wounds bleeding.

Thinking fast, Cade fires a magic dispelling bolt.

It injures her terribly, and she flees South the way she came.

Heading to the next room they are immediately struck by a battle going on!

In the middle of mannequins, wearing ancient ceremonial clothes, there is a hardened warrior woman battling an angry baboon, and the warrior is Handly winning.

This is Drusilla, the leader of the league of the kraken, and she is very upset that she is the only surviving member.

When she finds out that Cade is looking for Bonvive, the woman that she blames for all of her problems, she swiftly agrees to go with him as long as he can control the baboons.

She sees him immediately as a professional, and starts attempting to prepare him for an offer of working for her.

He actually warms up to her right away as a fellow thief, and in general bad ass.

Which is why it is so unfortunate. That in the very very next room, this tenuous alliance unravels entirely, when the missing company man, Sergeant Sapreciept was found.

The moment Drusilla sees him she launches herself at him with her magical sword. This was the man who killed her ex lover. Her feelings toward her were complicated, but she will get her revenge.

Cade decided that he will not intervene.

When just then, the company man blasts her with his magical ring, leaving her a chard almost corpse improbably still standing powered only by hatred.

And then the teenage boy behind him shoots her with a cross bolt and kills her.

Now disgusted, Cade signals Tooth-Tooth and companion to attack the sergeant.

A shell, shocked, teenage boy, who just committed his first kill, slumps to the ground.

And… scene.

My players having an awesome time! He is already said that he wants to continue gaming after we finish this module.

I have to say, I really enjoyed the way the Random Encounters table, surprised, even me, and how I had to interpret them. I would never have put the obsidian assassin hiding in the bed, but that was incredible and the player afterward said that he loved it.

Faction play it’s also causing a lot of really interesting emergent story. I knew that shit would hit the fan eventually but I did not realize it would be in this episode and so sad and spectacular.

I would love any comments, criticism, questions, and advice!

We play again next week.

Thanks for reading.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fa448c0>,osr,1678184332.0
Into The Odd x 40k Imperial Guard session 5,"(tldr: Session report on Imperial Guard squad delve into a Tyranid nest megadungeon.)

Message for my group! If any of you are reading this, STOP! It's full of spoilers.

In [session 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/phe731/into_the_odd_x_40k_imperial_guard_session_1_after/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the Imperial Guard platoon, posted to defend an ore mine on a rebellious planet, discovered a Tyranid nest. They need to find and destroy the three spawning pools to collapse the colony. They need to do it quick (9-12 sessions) or the imperial ship in orbit will blast the mine and write off this important objective as a lost cause.

In previous sessions they'd had their ups and downs, finding gear, getting into bad fights etc. At the end of the last session they had terrible luck and both plasma rifles blew up in the users' faces causing a TPK.

So this is the report on session 5. I was certain going in that they woud return to the genestealer cult lair they'd been exploring. In the previous session they'd killed a bunch of Hybrids and Purestrains in there (thanks to looted gear) so on internal-logic it made sense that the Magus (who was always on the encounter table for that zone) would be royally pissed off and ready to fight. I'd prepped for that, ready with rules for mind control, psychic screams and all kinds of fun. She'd stalk and harass them with psychic messages until they rolled an encounter with her or found her hiding place. Also at the end of last session they were literally one room away from their first Spawning Pool. Just one room away.

They set their new fire team and wouldn't you frikken know it. They decide to head in a completely different direction. Before they left they witnessed their Lt talking to the newly arrived Inquisitor and her retinue. Intrigue abound!

Anyway, they head down and in the first new room they find this fleshy hoola-hoop thing. One of them touches it and is teleported to a completely different part of the nest. It's the nids' short-range transport system. He 'ports back and the group decide this is what they're going to explore. They all 'port through.

This room has its own teleporter and a whole bunch of exits. Weirdly its lit with torches, so not nids (but could be stealer cult). They use the Guardsman Primer to look up some of the strange carvings in the the metal panals on the floor. Drukhari designs! They try to radio back to the Lt but they're too deep underground.

They find a Drukhari temple and two Wyches. With the help of frag grenades and their dog (they rolled a dog on the random starting items) they make short work of them. They also find some Drukhari gear in here which they loot.

Then they head through, but they're being stalked by something semi-invisble. They're very paranoid but when they come to a room filled with black oil and floating white balloon things they decide its too weird and obviously a trap so they turn to face their hunter. It's a medusae - it's got this hissing beam attack that reduces Wil. They battle it and lose a bunch of Wil and the dog is reduced to being catatonic. They dont want to carry back out it so put it down with a las-pistol. Sad times.

Now the oil room was a kind of trap. Well a hazard really as per the Bastionland / Into the Odd advice. I really like this approach, it's way more interesting to put a weird hazard in front of players rather than say ""Make a save, oh no you take X damage from this trap you didn't see"". The black oil itself is harmless, but it's deep and the balloon things that live in it will attach to anything trying to swim through and then drop like a stone to drown the swimmer. Anyway, just beyond the oil if they'd made it past was a passageway leading back to the genestealer cult zone! Had they made that connection it would have filled in a big part of the map for them. Alas they turned around. 

As it was they explored some more and found the Drukhari exit - a loooooong tunnel going straight up to the surface. From there they called the Lt with the intel. They were met with the Inquisitor who had some questions for them re the Drukhari. What the PCs dont know is that the Inquisitor is here because she thinks there is a Necron Tomb on this world (she's right) and that if the Necrons can be set against the Tyranids they're the perfect enemy for the Tyranids as they wont add biomass to the swarm. Next session I'll drop some more clues about all that. I want some other consequence from their interaction with the Inquisitor - not sure what, needs thought (she did let them keep their xeno weapons - she's kinda lax, a bit heretical TBH).

Ok so from there they head to another alternative entrance - this was the one that in session 2 (I think) the orbiting Imperial Ship laser-cannon blasted a hole down into the nest. But it was late so once they arrived there they met up with some other guard and called it a night.

So all three PCs survived tonight! We might get all four players next session in a couple of weeks and they've said they plan to go back into the Drukhari base.

What is a pack of Drukhari pirates doing there you might ask? Well they're collecting Tyranid poisons, venoms and pheramone sacks to use their weird, sexy murder experiments. If the PCs explore a bit more they'll find a room where a bunch of disected lesser Tyranids and collected body parts. Sick xeno freaks.

And with a bit of luck they'll find the pool that's in that zone too.

Now this isn't very OSR but I want to give them a little bit of help as they'll entering the second half of the campaign and haven't yet found a single pool. I dont know what you guys think of this. My idea was that when they eventually find the first pool, destroy it and pass that intel on to their HQ, the techpriest NPC can use the intel (what energy, biomass and chemical signatures the pool gave off) to roughly pinpoint the other pools. So, I can give them a map, not of the indivual rooms of the nest, but the zones - and tell them which zones have the remaining two pools. Thoughts on that? Too hand-holdy? Perhaps some lesser version of that?

Also, this session I started rolling encounter rolls in private so if they get an ambush they really wont know it's coming. And I stopped telling them the enemy remaining HP, which they prefer. Glad they told me because I prefer to see that info as a player to help make informed tacitcal choices on the battlefield.

Anyway there we go. We're at the half way mark now as the campaign could end from session 9 onwards and will end on session 12 at the latest.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fba33b0>,osr,1637361935.0
Into The Odd x 40k Imperial Guard session 8,"Session 8 report. Here's the [link to the previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/rylqwa/into_the_odd_x_imperial_guard/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Right, you guys know the score by now. The PCs are Imperial Guard exploring a Tyranid nest looking to destroy the three spawning pools that will collapse the colony.

Kind of an interesting one. Had this been anything other than an OSR megadungeon you'd think it was a disaster!

At the end of the last session the party brought a PDF soldier back with them to the commend tent. Now, normally each new session starts after a rest and they go on a fresh run into the nest looking for spawning pools. But this time I knew the PDF soldier might recognise that the PDF Officer helping the Guard Command was not all they seemed.

As the session began I made a roll and sure enough the solider knows this ""PDF Officer"" is dead so this must be an imposter. He walks in, sees the Officer, realises it's a trap/trick/monster and goes for his gun.

The party dont know what's going on but a couple of them suspect things are not as they appear (the soldier shouts ""By Terra!"" in surprise, suggesting he's loyal). Anyway at first they shoot at the soldier, but then the Officer reveals their truth form - a powerful psychic Magus hiding in their midst!

There is a short fight and a total TPK - the whole command team is wiped out too. 

Now I felt bad but I didn't fudge and rolls and I knew that when the PCs were previosuly in the Genestealer section of the nest there were clues around which would have warned them about the PDF Officer, but the PCs didn't spend a lot of time looking through stuff (chests and whatnot). So it is as it is. So I didn't feel toooo bad, but still. A shame. And it was a shame it was kind of an ambush. I much prefer it when PCs choose to start a fight.

They make a new team and head back into the nest. Very luckily they get a good luck roll and find the Pool-Sensor device - they'd have really struggled without it. Then, picking up the trail of the command team's bodies now dragged away by Hormagaunts. They track that for a bit but decide to drop that and go after the pools. The smarter move, IMO. They make some very nice tactical decisions moving through the tunnels to avoid ambush but forgot the behaviour of one of the monsters they encountered - a floating jellyfish thing that explodes AoE damage when you shoot it.

Yeah, they shot it.

But, they were basically fine and pressed on to where they met the Inquisitor who by now (thanks to the previous 'party') had found the outside of the Necron Tomb. A quick chat and an agreement that she would relay to the ship in orbit if they needed to tell the ship to hold off its massive laser barrage (smart - as the commanders would have been the ones to do that).

And the Inquisitor gave them some experimental gear too. Why not - they earned it.

They continued, relying on the tracker they'd recovered. A few more encounters and for the second time they fail to investigate the corpse of a burrower worm thingy that has the Necron Tomb key in its mouth!!

What can you do.

Oh, but their mapping is red hot now. They've learned and joined up big portions of the map and know what features are in nearby rooms. They skillfully navigate through. I'm proud.

Anyway, they make their way to a new area where the pool is. By terrible luck on the encounter roll they basically walk into Hive Tyrant.

They're fucked and they know it. Especially when I put a picture of it onto the VTT.

Again, a shame because it's a fight they didn't choose to start. Very, very tempted to change the encounter table so that a 1 is still a really tough opponent, but there is a chance the Party dont get spotted (Dex save for the lead) and can choose to back away slowly.

The Hive Tyrant takes them to pieces BUT one of them uses their portal gun to jump past before they're killed, and runs into the next chamber where they find... the second spawning pool!!

But by bad luck he has to deal with a Hormagaunt first, by the time that's done the Tyrant (who only had a 1-in-4 chance of finding him) catches up to him and chops him to peices too.

So they've found (but not destroyed) the second pool!

However, they're running out of time. The ship in orbit is getting antsy and there is a 1-in-4 chance that ship will fire its barrage down on the site at the end of the next session IF they haven't destroyed the two remaining pools. That will end the campaign.

They were unlucky to roll that Tyrant when they did otherwise they'd have had that second pool for sure.

Still everything to play for but my god it's gonna be close.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fbb0bc0>,osr,1642807405.0
The Lost Bay - actual play 11 Feb 2023,"Play report diary by Gorkhan (who plays Hakim) - Characters and classes: Hakim (Asphalt Kitten), Tim (Splinter), Creek (Screamer), Facilitator: IKO - The Lost Bay is a suburban horror RPG set in the 90s

>A Saturday night, like any other in the end of summer. Hakim and his pals: Tim and Creek, stop by a 24/24 shop to buy some beers before going to Creek's concert. This is the shop where Alex is working, a girl friend and fellow punk musician of Creek.  
>  
>In the shop, the floor is soaked with water. Alex is nowhere in sight. With all the electric stuff running in there, Hakim does not want to get inside. Tim jumps on the cashier's desk to avoid the water, and starts exploring. The three guys are calling for Alex... when Tim sees someone laying on the floor, their legs blocking the door of a closet, the upper body hidden inside. Forgetting safety, the young men rush in to help. Creek and Hakim arrive first and discover Alex, laying in a pool of brackish water, chocking as a fountain of the stinky liquid pours out of her mouth. Hakim is chocked and can't move. Creek tries to help Alex out of the closet, and Tim calls for an ambulance. Finally, Hakim get back his sens and helps Creek to move Alex on the parking lot. The poor woman is drowning, and the stream of water does not stop. Tim tries to call for Saint Abraham The Young to stop the flow, but the holy patron is deaf to the prayer. Tim start's expelling water as well, but after a cough, his own fountain dries out. In the mean time, Alex is dead. And the ambulance arrives...  
>  
>The next afternoon, the three friends, still chocked by the events of the night, meet at the skate park. Tim remembers that the emergency agent on the phone let think that this was not the first time someone died this way. Hakim tries to collect information from two kids playing around, but they know nothing. Creek has a punk friend who is also a cop (!), and might have a clue. He calls him, but his friend does not want to talk about it on the phone. He proposes to meet at the pizza truck this evening.  
>  
>To kill time, they decide to go to Alex's flat. The door is closed, but Jimmy, her cat, is meowing from inside. Tim can't stand the sad voice of the lonely cat and breaks in. While he takes care of Jimmy, Creek and Hakim visit the place. In the fridge, Creek finds a bag filled with disgusting dead... snakes ? fishes ? Anyway, not the usual food Alex his cooking. In the bathroom, Hakim finds some of Alex's clothes, soaking wet and still stained with mud from the marshes. Then, Hank enters the flat, calling for Alex. Hank is one of Alex's neighbours. He didn't know about Alex's death and is devastated. He tells the guys that they went to a great place in the marshes just the day before. He is fuzzy about the place itself, talking about a long trip by boat to get there, about a cool guy cooking eels (Alex loved it and got some in her fridge), about a cabin in the wood, and happy mushrooms they took before going there. Hakim asks Creek of his cop friend would be interested talking to Hank, but Creek thinks it is better not to involve Hank for the moment.  
>  
>Leaving the flat, the three friends take Jimmy to Tim's place. At a moment, Tim feels sick and spits brackish water again. Luckily, the flow stops quickly, but Hakim and Creek wonder if the ""fountain syndrome"" might be contagious. When Tim seems ok, they decide to go to the Pizza Truck to have dinner.  
>  
>A woman is there, talking to everyone, asking questions around. When she spots the young men, she gets to them and presents herself: Linda, born in the Lost Bay, and back after a long stay in the big city. She is looking for strange stories for her novels. She is a wannabe horror novelist. She tells them that the drowning events happened at least 14 times in the past two weeks, and affect only young adults.

Into The Odd x Imperial Guard,"Session 7 report. Here's the [link to the previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/ritsof/into_the_odd_x_40k_imperial_guard_session_6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Right, you guys know the score by now. The PCs are Imperial Guard exploring a Tyranid nest looking to destroy the three spawning pools that will collapse the colony.

Gonna keep this one short as I'm knackered, but if I leave it until tomorrow I'll have forgotten half of it and these reports are actually really helpful to me as a GM! I'll edit for grammar/spelling tomorrow. Too tired. \[Edit - warning, it's one of the longest posts I've done\]

Last session the big thing was that the party finally found their first spawning pool, and at the end of the session they convinced the Techpriest to make them a sensor device so they could find other pools more easily.

Tonight I had absolutely no idea which way they'd explore. They had a bunch of options. Tricky cuz I like to pre-read my map notes as prep, but this time I just had to turn to the relevant page and hope that my notes got me through!

As it was they went straight back to the big drill they'd destroyed previously to pick up the exploration from there. I'd decided there should be a Mawloc in there basically waiting for them because they'd destroyed the drill and pissed off that part of the nest.

The creature is a big armoured toothy caterpiller/snake thing. It tunnelled underground and popped up for a good bite at a couple of them before they worked out a tactic. They threw a heavy piece of kit they had (a big car battery) attached to rope, and then dragged that across the floor, making enough noise to draw it up to the surface. When it popped up they shot it to pieces.

Funny how fights go. Once they work out a clever tactic it's usually won very quickly. It's when they don't that things to wrong.

Anyway I had previously decided to put some loot/gear in the thing's stomach, but they didn't check it (despite my confirming that the battery would still be inside it if they wanted to get it back). Ah well. Maybe I need to telegraph more that 'stuff' is available if they look for it.

They found the outside of an impenetrable Necron tomb and correctly summised that this was the reason this nest is here at all - the nids are trying to break in. The party radio'd back and told the Inquisitor, obviously.

They had an encounter with some 'mimics' - quite fun. Just mostly harmless things that look human, steal human clothes but can only speak in stock phrases. They're a nid experiment in infiltration. As soon as they acted strangly the party said ""fuck that"" and blew them away. One mimic survived the initial attack and got close enough to throw up on one of the PCs - so it was sideways glances at him for the rest of the session to see if he started acting weird. The vomit would have affected him had he not been wearing a gas mask (so 'current-affairs', this megadungeon).

They completely missed the 'Necron Key' in the next chamber - it's a big 'scroll-case shaped thing choking the gullet of another dead Mawloc. I'm not gonna move the key. Instead I think I need to clue the party into the fact corpses are lootable. Then maybe they'll go back and check. It isn't like they need it for any ""plot"" or anything, if they miss it it makes no difference, but I think I to make it more obvious there is something here to investigate.

Ok, next they destroyed an egg room. Then found the ice-break-acid room from last session and realised they'd been here before but coming from the other tunnel. Our mapper said ""That's interesting!"" in a way that makes me think he's just put a big peice of the map together. I think he's gonna put his map on the discord next week.

They found a sponge thing. All they had to do was walk past it. I looked at my notes that said ""Trap. Sponge. If they disturb: Chlorine gas"" and thought - ""That's a terrible trap, they can just edge around it and ignore it"". At that moment one of them said ""I shoot the sponge"".

Nice.

Luckily he wears a gas mask but they had to flee and that room was effectively blocked off for the rest of the session so they could only go forwards. Actually it wasa bad trap because it's that kind of thing that disuades them from exploring/prodding stuff.

On into a landmined room and then two encounters virtually back to back. Basically, to clear the landmines they chucked in a frag granade for a chain reaction. I thought ""yeah that'll work, but there's no way that explosion doesn't draw an encounter"". So I rolled until I got an encounter. Hormagaunts. Classic enemy, good fight and one of the party almost gets dragged off for food.

They rest to recover HP but immediately get another encounter during the rest!

This time it's a PDF and (unbeknownst to him) a mimic, but this one is basically The Thing. It can't talk. That's the clue something is wrong. One of the party notices that this other guy isn't speaking. They ask him his name and he doesn't respond. He walks over to one of the party (same guy who got vomited on AND who triggered the chlorine), I wait for a response/attack/whatever but everyone pauses unsure what to do. So... I roll damage as The Thing attacks.

They make it through that by the skin of their teeth. One of them is in real bad shape. Very luckily they find a new teleport hoop. They bring the PDF guy with them and teleport back to home-base.

It's gone time so we call it a night.

Now, next session I've gotta make an important luck roll. Does this PDF guy they picked up know that the PDF Sgt advising the Guard command team is a genestealer-cultist?? If he does it's straight into shouted accusations and probably a very important initiative roll.

If he doesn't know then the party can carry on as normal and probably head back to the teleporter they just found. And very soon on my random events table that PDF Sgt is gonna kill the party's commanding officer.

Anyway I'm pretty sure next session they're gonna continue their new exploration tactic; teleport down then walk/climb up and up until they can to join the map together. If they do that they should find the next spawning pool next session. Very good.

The only other note I'll add tonight is that so far they've been very, very lucky with 'boss fights'. I've put in some tough encounters but so far I've either not rolled them or they've worked out a tactic and walked it! Whereas other encounters I think will be weird-but-easy really throw them!

Maybe that's the way to make fights hard - make them weird rather than high HP, high Strength slug-fests.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fba3710>,osr,1641599575.0
Into The Odd x 40k Imperial Guard - session 6,"(tldr: Session report on Imperial Guard squad delve into a Tyranid nest megadungeon. They need to find and destroy three spawning pools before the Imperial Ship in space blows up the whole site.)

Message for my group! If any of you are reading this, STOP! It's full of spoilers.

Link to [session 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/phe731/into_the_odd_x_40k_imperial_guard_session_1_after/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) report. Link to previous session 5.

This time they started off at the entrance to the ladders that headed down to the Drukhari zone. For one dreaded minute I thought they were going to go into the other entrance, the crater which, while prepped with encounter tables etc, I hadn't read in ages! 

Anyway, fortunately they stuck to their previous plan and climbed down the ladders. One of them had, at last, been keeping a map and so they were able to make some smart choices. ""I think the teleporter is that way"" etc. 

They climb down and thanks to the map maker they quickly identify a passageway they'd not explored. Down they go...

And yes, at long last, half way through the campaign, they finally found... a spawning pool!!

Blew it to hell with grenades and got super-lucky with the encounter rolls so nothing came to see what the problem was. Part of the reason for that was they killed so many Drukhari in the last session there are genuinly not that many left in this zone.

Now they got into the room where the Drukhari had been disecting captured Hormagaunts and taking their vemons and pheromones. Lots of stuff to potentially explore - pheromones they can use to manipulate Nid activity, cannisters of Nid acid, Drukhari weapons. They ignored the lot! Facepalm. 

Now I did something you OSR folks wont like (naughty storygame move)... I had prepped a map, a map of the whole nest which the Drukhari had made, but it's in their alien language so the PCs need to study it to figure that out. Anyway. I had it in this disection room on the table. They didn't even look at the table.  So, I put it in the next room on the wall so they couldn't miss it.

I know, I know! But it's done now. 

They had a good look at the map but couldn't quite figure it out. At some point if they think about it carefully they might realise that each 'node' on the map isn't a room - it's a entire nest. But it's with them now, it's up to them to figure it out.

From there they explored a bit, and left the Drukhari area. The found an ice-hazard; the floor is covered in thin ice, no way to walk normally across it to the other exits without the ice breaking and the liquid underneath is a shallow chlorine-acid to burn your feet and lungs. They couldn't figure out a way safely through that room so they returned to the Drukhari area. At this point they realised that two sets of hazard-rooms were adjacent, one tyranid-biological, and the other Drukhari technological. They correctly theorised that this was the border between two zones and the Drukhari had carved out a safe area so they could experiment on captured tyranid creatures. Well done!  

Next they took the teleporter to a random area and by chance (unknown to them) they were actually back at that same zone they'd just left but in a different room! (about a 1-in-5 chance,the just guessed lucky on which teleporter to go to). They found a big drilling operation where Ravenor nids (burrowers) and brood brothers in a huge drilling machine are trying, without success, to break into a sealed Necron Tomb. They didn't go deep enough into the complext to see the tomb, but they did manage to kill the creatures and Krak grenade the big mining drill. 

After that they were a bit worse for wear from the fight so they headed back to the surface and we called it a night.

Overall they really seemed to enjoy it, especially the map-maker - I knew he'd like it. I think he'd be a big OSR convert.    

I'm sorry not sorry about the Drukhari map - I really should have given them more info from the very start. I'm of a mind that if I run this kind of game again I'll just give the PCs a map at the start - it just wont have any content on it. So they can make add slightly more informed choices. 

They were well boosted to have found a spawning pool. Lol, only two to go and 3-6 sessions left! 

Oh, and once they got back to the surface they cleverly told the techpriest all about how hot the spawn-pool was and whether he could make them a device to detect the others. It was a good call so they'll have some kind of clicker-detector thing next session. This is something someone suggested to me on the subreddit last time. So that worked out.

Cheers for reading, hope you enjoyed. Next session will to early to mid January, I reckon.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fbb2b70>,osr,1639783894.0
Into The Odd x 40k Imperial Guard session 9 - THE FINALE!,"[Link to previous session](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/s9o1hy/into_the_odd_x_40k_imperial_guard_session_8/)

Well there it is! - Only nine sessions but it felt epic! 

(For those who don't know the PCs are Imperial Guard exploring a Tyranid nest looking to destroy the three spawning pools. But they're on the clock, they need to do it before the Imperial Ship in orbit decides the risk is too great and nukes the site from orbit)

In the last session the command team got wiped out by a Genestealer Magus, and the PCs found but failed to destroy the second pool. 

At the start of this session Inquisitor Vex tells the platoon, including the PCs that she's taking command of the situation, that the whole platoon is to hunt down the last two pools, b ut also keep an eye out for this Xenos item (a key allowing access to the Necron tomb she knows is buried here). 

Now, I'd already warned the PCs that this could be the last session. If I rolled a 4 on a d4 it meant the Imperial ship would blow up the site at the end of the session if the PCs had not been victorious. They'd laughed and joked last session that it was guaranteed I'd roll a 4. 

I rolled.

Got a 4.

They cheered. 

So, off they went into the nest for what would, one way or the other, be the last time.

I'd re-written the encounter table, knowing that the nest was thrown into chaos. I basically had a d12 table of encounters with lots of the results being encounters with not only Tyranids but Imperial Guard exploring, getting into scrapes, getting eaten etc. What I decided was, if they rolled the same encounter a second time it just meant nothing was in the room. 

Also for encounters, especially after the unsatisfying TPKs in the last session, monsters would be either Watchful (can't be ambushed, so use Dex saves to see which PCs act first if they start a fight), or Oblivious (can be ambushed). This is intead of the PCs descsribing how they carefully stalk into a room only to have me roll a surprise encounter they can't get out of. 

And I'd written a new loot table based on the movement of stuff in the nest, as the genestealer hybrids moved about in a panic trying to defend the nest and move resources/loot to new locations. It included some weird weapons, the genestealer cult holy book (signed by various cult members), and... dun dun duuuh... the Necron Key (because the cult didn't know what it was but thought it looked important).

Anyway, into the nest they go.

First encounter they get is the Magus. Big LOLs all round. I carefully describe how it's oblivious but appears to have taken psychic command of a bunch of Guard. I'm thinking that after last time they'll develop some plan or strategy. Private Howard shoots it immediately without warning. Sgt Voldov says ""And that's why we've only found one pool and we're on the last session"". Heehee! 

But it works! 

After a couple of rounds of quite lucky shots and dex rolls the PCs manage to nail the Magus before she can succeed in mind controlling them, or teleport away. (Yeah I know Magi have no teleport ability in 40k lore but this one can so shhh).

They find that the Magus has the Genestealer cult holy book, which has been signed by various cult members. Useful intel for sure (shame they didn't find it earlier!)

Brief chat with the Guardsmen they just saved and on they push. Sgt Voldov is the player who's been keeping the map and he think he knows how to get to the second pool from last session. 

Next they encounter one of the floating-explodey things. This is the third one they've encountered so they're much more careful. They watch to see what it does and it floats off into another room. 

(Brief interlufe to say; I used the Into The Odd luck roll to decide that. It's just the most obvious mechanic for deciding things that happen but I GM'd for years without really being sure if it was ok to GM that way. I know you guys already all know this but it's so liberating and exciting using the dice to make simple choices like that instead of feeling like I had to decide ""what was most logical"" or ""what was most cool"".)

They follow the Floaty down, which is co-incidentally where they wanted to head. It goes into this room  where a Tyranid wasps nest covers the floor. Tread on it and wasps will attack. They wait for the Floaty to be close to the floor, but far away from them. I roll for an encounter while they wait but they get lucky. They blast the Floaty and it explodes, destroying the wasps nest! Nice.

On they go and bump into the Astartes who works for the Inquisitor. Lots of saluting. ""Emperor Protects"" and so on. 

They follow their map and find the pool! Yay! Frag grenades. Job done. 

But now they're back to exploring. We're about half way through the session and I think to myself ""There is about 20% of the dungeon they've not explored, they're gonna have to be very lucky to find either the Necron key or the 3rd pool before the time runs out - but with two possible goals it's not impossible"". 

They carry on passed some grease-excreting slugs, and find part of the Necron Tomb. Which they radio back to the Marine. 

Further on they find more rooms they'd been through before, then up to a new room. It's got a Drukhari-victim-guard-amputee-living-bomb, and also a Tyranid egg on top of a tall plinth. They shoot the guard thing double quick and nope their way past the plinth ""Not a pool, so not an objective, ignore and move on"".

Up some more and they come to a Mexican stand-off between a squad of Guard and a squad of PDF, each accusing the other of unwittingly sheltering an Imposter (basically The Thing). Clever use of a bioscanner, and the names from the book reveal who the cultists and Imposters are. Some more shooting and once that's over a bit of a chat with the remaining survivors, swapping intel etc. 

They find a power-generator that some clever soul has rigged up as a massive bomb, enough to take out the whole nest and everything around it, so they bagsey they detonator and the Sgt keeps it in his big hat as insurance (he's got a Valhalla Regiment style hat).  

Onwards they find the Necron Tomb door and a nice keyhole with it! Plus a couple more guardsmen and an acid-excreting slug/sponge. Not meant to be a monster, more of an oddity. A brief interlude while Private Loughton discusses the creature in the manner of a train spotter or a Tolkien Lore nerd. Guardsman Primers are referred to and many chins are stroked. 

They almost, ALMOST go the wrong way, away from the third pool that they're getting closer and closer to! They're so close! 

Then they get to this pit with a poison gas machine at the bottom. Luckily they have some gas masks from before so they easily get round that, however, I don't know if they must have been talking about the game but in this session they've been searching bodies like mother-fuckers, leaving no stone unturned! There are a few dead bodies down here (foam around their mouths etc from the gas - who know what happened), and they search them. 

By an absolutely lucky break one of the bodies has the Necron key!! 

OMFG!! Big cheers, ""We've done it, lads"" etc. They track down the Astartes and pass over the key. He gives them a choice - either come with me and the Inquisitor into the Necron Tomb, or get as many guardsman out as you get and awake transport offworld. 

They have a big chat and decide ""No, too many Guardsmen, including the commanding officers, have died for this. If we've got the chance to leave with our lives we should take it"" 

So, they head on out. 

They roll one last encounter - I thought for one horrible moment it was gonna be the Hive Tyrant which would have been cheesy - but it was just a wounded Drukhari. They killed him quick and escaped to the surface, radioing as many guardsmen as they could on the way. 

On the surface they watched as transports from the Imperial Ships came down and they finally made it off-world.

Boom. Done.

They enjoyed it. 

Nice chatter to decompress and we said bye, and I came on here and typed this up!! 

There's certainly a lot I enjoyed about running a Megadungeon, and about using Into The Odd (a brilliant system - I really want to run it as written in the industial horror setting). 

There's a lot I'd do different - the main thing being not mapping out the whole dungeon room by room before I began. I wish I'd run it in the Dave Arneson style of building it as I went from session to session - to make the whole thing more reactive to PC actions, and less stuck in my own prep. PRobably only start with a bare outline of what each broad area was going to be like.

But that aside, plus not putting the PCs into unavoidable fights, I think it went well. 

One big improvment is that in between sessions of this I've run other games and I've stripped my prep notes way back. I can now run games much more fluidly off only a side of A3 worth of notes. 

If you read alllllllll that, thank you - you can repay me by posting your session reports, as a player or a GM - I love that shit!

Into The Odd x 40k Imperial Guard session 4,"(tldr: Tyranid nest megadungeon - they made good progress but some incredible good/bad luck at the end)

Message for my group! If any of you are reading this, STOP! It's full of spoilers.

In [session 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/phe731/into_the_odd_x_40k_imperial_guard_session_1_after/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the Imperial Guard platoon, posted to defend an ore mine on a rebellious planet, discovered a Tyranid nest. They need to find and destroy the three spawning pools to collapse the colony. They need to do it quick (9-12 sessions) or the imperial ship in orbit will blast the mine and write off this important objective as a lost cause.

In [session 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/ps6069/into_the_odd_x_40k_imperial_guard_session_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) they made a little bit of progress but mostly got TPK'd a couple of times.

In [session 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/pzifi4/into_the_odd_x_40k_imperial_guard_session_3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) they made great progress through the beginning 'zone' of the nest and destroyed a room full of nid eggs. They pushed on and reached the next zone - the home of the Genestealer Cult. Amongst a bunch of xeno intel they also find a Plasma Rifle!

In this session 4 all of their current characters have now survived at least delve into the nest. The session opens with a good portion of the NPC platoon decending into the nest and setting up a forward base in the beginning zone. Their Lt commander congratulates the PCs that wiping out that room of eggs seems to have caused the nids to fall back from this zone of the nest.

(I wanted the PCs to feel/notice the results of their actions last time, so I've basically rewritten the opening zone and there are no more 'encounter' rolls in there for now. I might add the Lictor back in to an encounter table as they never actually killed it. Not sure yet, dont want to take away their victory.)

The PCs leave the beginning zone and head through straight back down to the Genestealer Cult zone. This is funny and frustrating because in the opening room of the beginning zone is literally next door to a teleporter room and exits to other zones. But anyway...

Back in the Cult rooms they find out way too late that the occupants have boobytrapped the door they used the first time. Then, because they rest to recover they trigger an encounter with two purestrain Genestealers! However, as they were watching the exits this time they get the jump on the xenos and take them down, losing only a little health here and there. But one of them suffers the Stealer's Kiss! The rest of the unit whispering behind his back decide not to report him to the Commissar as their Guardsman's Primer orders, but they hope he'll die in combat so that maybe the Emperor will have mercy on his tainted soul.

They rest again but luckly only encounter some escaped prisoners, who they pump for info before continuing. They come across an unfamiliar machine which they shoot to bits (it was a satellite reader, so they did the right thing shooting it, but they dont know that), and a Genestealer Cult shrine, which they promtly burn! They get into it with some Brood Brothers hiding behind a locked door. The PC with the Plasma Rifle decides to shoot through the lock. If the rifle rolls ten on a d10 it works too well and the Guardsman also takes ten damage from the overloading gun.

You guessed it. He kills himself blasting through the door.

At this point the PCs decide to fall back and recruit another guardsman to come back up to full strength. A shame because they were literally one door away from a prison where I could have given them another PC.

Anyway they load up, swap over some gear and come straight back with new load-outs and a new guardsman (who sounds like Bobcat, sounds annoying on paper but was actually hilarious). With all their looted gear they've got flamers, plasma rifles, chainswords... all sorts!

They push on and find the Genestealer Magus meditation room. Through blind luck she isn't home! So no boss fight. I made her really nasty too, even with their new gear if they go head to head they'll be lucky not to TPK.

They find a prison, free some prisoners but can't work out how to safely open a boobytrapped box. Shame because the box has evidence that shows the PDF commander helping their Lietenant is actually a Genestealer Cult spy!! If they dont find that info soon there is a good chance that on my Fronts and Portents table the PDF commander will kill the Lt.

They then get to a feeding room with a bunch of half-eaten corpses, and light it up, waking two sleeping Genestealers. This time their rolls dont go so well. Two of them go down, one stealer goes down and the last two guardsmen fire their plasma rifles.

They both roll 10s!

They each immolate themselves in plasma fire and the stealer manges to somehow survive this onslaught. No doubt to eat their KO'd bodies.

After that it's past time so we call it a night.

Reader, they are literally one door away from finding their first Tyranid spawning pool. It's in the next room!! If they'd survived the feasting room  they'd have probably have gone in there, wiped it out and been 1/3 of the way to game victory! Insterad they are about half way through the campaign heading towards failure - that ship in orbit is looming.

Still, hopefully next session, unless they change direction they should find the pool so that should be a good session for them. And through careful use of doorways they've actually cleared a lot of this zone, so the encounter table is throwing up fewer enemies as they go.

I tell you what though, they still wont make maps! Lol. And they've yet to defeat a boss (having been taken out by a Lictor and so far avoided the Magus). 

I hope you enjoyed reading as much as I enjoyed recapping. Will post again in a couple of weeks.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fbb0d10>,osr,1636154785.0
Hot Springs Island #4 & #5 - Bath House's Heat,"Hi! After a short break, I'm back with my **Hot Springs Island** actual plays. This time it will be a double report - since the last post ([\#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/te0atj/hot_springs_island_impressions_after_the_first/) and [\#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/tiolto/hot_springs_island_another_session_another_hex/) and [\#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/ts71q1/hot_springs_island_enter_the_ruins/)) we have played two sessions, both mainly in the bath house, which is the ""main"" dungeon on this hex.

I tried to avoid spoilers or hide them behind ROT13, because the report can potentially be read by people who would like to play this module in the future (I highly recommend), but something can always slip away, so read carefully!

The travelers exploring the island decided to explore the main Bath-Theater in the elven ruins, where the (SPOILER ALERT) Zrygnyvn is trapped (/END OF THE SPOILER). It took them a total of a day and a half in the game world (with withdrawal to the base behind the Cloud Falls in the meantime) and two sessions. On the first day (the third day of their stay on the island), the crew found out what happened to the unlucky artist and her band, but they have not yet managed to end the ""curse"" of this place. On the second day, they came back to save a few statues of unlucky people (= new potential retainers) and grab the treasures from there. Among them were numerous magical fancies (including Monkey Phone, Orgy-in-a-Bag and Codpiece of Sustainability - the elves from the Isle of Light were very liberated), which later helped them safely escape from the bloodthirsty Arva lizardfolk, which was looking for someone - or something! - in this particular bath house.

If you want to run HSI, my advice after these two specific sessions is as follows - prepare yourself in advance a system for generating treasures and finds in ruins, because the book itself does not have such a procedure (which is not very strange considering the fact that this is a system-neutral module, and many in OSRs, including Five Torches Deep, on which I run it, finding gold is associated with character development), yet an important element of this adventure is gaining wealth in forgotten, steaming ruins. The bath house itself is actually described only by rules of the above-mentioned curse and the list of rooms on individual floors - the drawing of their layout and contents remains in the hands of the GM. It's a pity, considering how nice the other dungeons are written in this module, but it was not very difficult (I was inspired by the Pompeii thermal bath plan).

In the game itself, I really liked how the players were thinking ""outside the box"" to solve and overcome challenges that would be deadly for them in the event of a physical confrontation, and to overcome obstacles on the way to treasures (opening the lock with the water-freezing spell was extraordinary). The risks associated with casting spells also worked very well, making the characters carefull in managing spells and motivated to cast them long and carefully in the form of a ritual. It fits my vision of a cool, exciting fantasy where ""magic detection"" is not used like in computer games by enabling ""detective mode"", but as an important plot moment, with its own tension and stakes (like - ok, you will surely succeed - but it's possible that the Arva lizards will have time to find you before the end of the rite).

That's it for now - the characters have managed to return to the camp with treasure, and for now they want to explore some other hexes near the ruins. Fortunately, I do not have to wonder what will happen, because this is why I run OSR - so that each session will surprise me as well. So let's see what will come out from the tables next time!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fbb3d40>,osr,1650917577.0

**TLDR; Adventures so far summary**:

\- PCs left former lives to pursue rumours of treasure in a remote region called Illmire.

\- while exploring a burial mound, they met the locale militia an agreed to join them.

\- the new militia leader, Malstern, has a reputation for cruelty. He's assigned the PCs to find a local druid named Yorivar, who has been ""causing trouble"" for the new priest in the town of Illmire.

\- the PCs search Yorivar's home and find evidence that he has fled to the ""Spider Woods""

 \- while travelling, they detour to loot a sunken fort.

**Feb 26 Summary**:

Tonight's Knave:

\- Rell, Arty's best friend who stepped up after he died, but quickly fell into a pool of water and did not return. Skip, the scribe, replaced him

.- Croaker, the gravedigger

\- Joo, the gambler

&#x200B;

\- after looting the fort, each PC has the equivalent of a year of militia's salary. They have little reason to continue their service, but fear Malstern may not accept resignations with an outstanding assignment (or at all), and travelling around town with that much cash will attract attention.

\- With over-loaded backpacks and few options, the PC decide to hide their treasure inside the fort. Hoping to find a good spot in the pool of dark water near the entrance, Rell dives in while Joo and Croaker secure him with a rope. They feel a strong tug, and try to pull Rell up, but only catch a glimpse before he is pulled back down by something very large and powerful. RIP Rell.

\- instead of risking the pool again, the PCs leave their excess treasure and items in the cave they discovered while descending into the sunken fort.

\- after camping the night, the PCs decide against pursuing the druid. They are much more intrigued by the distant tower that is home to a Sorcerer known as ""The Observer.""

\- the tower is made of crumbling alabaster, with an entire section half-way up missing, but the top somehow still suspended above.

\- knocks go unanswered, but the door is slightly open and stairways beyond leeding up and down.

\- the PCs go up, and find a floor covered in knee-deep leaves. Moving some aside reveals large gecko-traps. The PCs carefully clear a path to the stairs, and can smell urine, feces, and grime from above.

\- the next floor is home to 3-foot tall humanoids with mutated features; beaks, clawed or webbed toes and hands, feathers and green skin. They speak few words, but are excited to see the group and introduce them to their leader, ""Grick"", who is slightly taller and speaks a few more words - ""Grick want tower."" He accepts the PCs help in exchange for them keeping what they find.

\- Grick tell the PCs that in the tower above are ""many eyes"" - some small creatures with one eye, and one big creature with many eyes. There are also stone birds the size of two men.

\- while guiding the PCs up a ladder, one ""Grick-man"" suddenly start convulsing, having seizures, and falls its death. The others shriek feral howls before resuming as if nothing had happened.

\- the group reaches a heavy oak door with a bronze face of an elven woman. She asks for a password and seems annoyed when the group cannot provide it. She is concerned about her appearance after centuries in the tower and would like to see herself. The PCs try polishing weapons and helmets to reflect, but the door complains that they are not large or clear enough to appreciate her beauty.

\- Joo starts formulating a plan to use the lenses of his microscope to make a helmet full if water appear as a larger reflecting pool but will still need a larger basin for it to work. Croaker and Skip seem skeptical and convince Joo to join them searching downstairs.

\- the stairs spiral downward several hundred feet before opening to an underground sea with several islands nearby. A rowboat sits docked inviting the PCs into the water where metre-long fish and thick, white eels can be seen.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fbb36b0>,osr,1646162489.0
Keep on the Borderlands Continued...,"Catching up on the next few sessions after the [Previous Play Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/sgrwu8/actual_play_from_this_weekend/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that I posted...

Grokel, Snoh, Gusingo, and Fredo spent a few days with their new ally Tomey the Troll before deciding to head back to Cobesfort. Before leaving Tomey's tower they learned that he had been seeing an increasing number of lizardmen in the swamp east of his tower (southeast of the fort).

Once back in Cobesfort they were surprised to find that their sister Sket had arrived, irritated that the brothers had gone off to find adventure without her. They rested for a week, fiddling away more of their hard earned coin.  Then, with their sister Sket in tow, they decided to head down into the swamp to investigate the rumors of lizardmen that Tomey had told them about.

The first excursion into the swamp was short lived when they found that their donkey and mule, Larry and Curly, could not pull their loot wagon through the marsh. They returned to the keep, stabled their beasts of burden, and headed back out the following morning on foot. The trip through the swamp was slow and in the afternoon Fredo was suddenly dragged beneath the muck. The adventurers realized that they had been beset upon by five alligators!

Gusingo was able to wrestle his friend back to the surface while Grokel, Snoh, and Sket traded blows with the monstrous reptiles. Badly injured, they were able to claim victory and drag Fredo and two of the dead alligators back to the fort where they sold them to the furrier and commissioned some alligator skin boots.

Taking it easy in the fort for another week they discussed their next moves. Ultimately they decided to head back to the caves as it had been some time since they had a successful expedition which brought back any real coin. They were able to make it to the caves without event. Before entering the goblin cave, Snoh suggested they do some reconnaissance and used his minimize spell to shrink himself, Fredo, and Gusingo down to the size of mice to scout the cave while Sket and Grokel waited at the cave entrance. They found that hobgoblins had personally taken charge of the remaining goblins and built some crude fortifications from crates and barrels in the tunnels.

They attempted to sneak into the cave and get a flanking position, but found themselves surrounded. Grokel used his last Terror Arrow to send the small contingent to west fleeing and the party pressed east where they had done less exploration. The hobgoblins and goblins fell before them (the party was rolling well that session) and they pressed up into the caves. Ultimately they were able to get the drop on a large hobgoblin with a whip and two hobgoblins in what appeared to be a torture chamber. After a pitched fight which brought two of them near death they began to assess the prisoners that were present. They found a frenzied Gnoll straining against his chains, a stoic orc named Grumok who promised to fight with them against the hobgoblins, a merchant and his wife named Henric and Cora Goldworth, and their bodyguards Gonnor and Schmael. They released the Goldworths, Gonnor, and Schmael immediately. The merchants begged that they escape immediately to the keep. The party armed Gonnor and Schmael who agreed to accompany the party for a year for the price of room, board, weapons, and armor in return for saving their lives. After much discussion they freed Grumok but refused to give him a weapon. However, Grumok picked up a sword from a slain hobgoblin and slew the still chained gnoll before the party could react. The party agreed to make an escape. Snoh scouted ahead and found an exit from the cave not far from their current location.

Upon making it to the exit Grumok broke out into a run north across the canyon. Grokel made chase as Snoh, Snek, Gusingo, and Fredo helped their rescues down the slope to the canyon floor. Grumok proved too fast for Grokel who slipped and fell on his way down and was climbing the north face of the canyon toward an unexplored cave. Desperate, Grokel pulled out his bow and shot Grumok in the back just as he reached the mouth of the cave. Grumok fell forward into the cave and soon after four more orcs came pouring out waving spears. The party fled and the orcs did not give chase in the late afternoon sun.

Back at the keep the Goldworths gave the party 100 gold and a fancy looking dagger for rescuing them. The party licked its wounds counted their money, realizing they had not made any real coin since looting the ogre cave. Living in an inn and eating every meal in the tavern was not cheap, especially with their increasingly large retinue. They resolved to head back to the caves.

They returned to the caves and once again Snoh used his magic to shrink a few of them to do some reconnaissance, but they only found slaughtered goblins and hobgoblins. They pushed west this time and found room after room ransacked and strewn with slain goblins. Continuing their exploration they came upon a room with a dead orc, more dead goblins, and a goblin strung up to the wall with a pewter crown on his brow. They searched this room and found it previously looted like the rest, but in the back corner was a shallow pit filled with refuse and a excrement covered leather sack. Opening the bag they found that looking into it was like looking into a deep dark pit. Turning the bag over and shaking it, nothing came out except a foul stench. Holding his nose, Grokel reached in. His arm went up to the shoulder into the leather sack and when he withdrew it his arm was covered in goblin excrement. Not completely put off, he placed his lantern into the bag and found that it was no heavier than before he had put his lantern in. He reached his arm back in and withdrew the lantern, now covered in foul refuse (a bag of holding that the goblins used as a latrine). A little put off, they kept the sack and pushed on.

Snoh found a secret door in a ransacked storeroom which lead to more rooms strewn with dead hobgoblins and the occasional orc. Eventually they made their way to a room with a huge dead hobgoblin and several well armed dead guards and several dead orcs. This room had also been looted, but they found three gold pieces on the floor. In the corner Snoh discovered a false bottom in a chest full of spoiled furs that the orcs had missed. Opening it they found a cache of electrum and gold!

Pocketing their prize they made their way back to the keep where they planned their next move. Obviously the orcs, probably due to Grumok, had learned that the goblins and hobgoblins had been severely weakened by the adventurer's repeated assaults on their lair and launched an assault of their own. What treasures had the orcs made off with?

Maybe we will find out next time...",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x11fbb1dc0>,osr,1645323234.0
