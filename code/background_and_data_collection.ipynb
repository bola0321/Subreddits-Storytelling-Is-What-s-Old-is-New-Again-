    "### Origins and Dragons\n",
    "\n",
    "The genesis of RPGs can be traced back to the late 1960s and early 1970s, rooted in tabletop wargaming traditions. A pivotal moment occurred in 1969 with \"Braunstein,\" a game devised by David Wesely in St. Paul, Minnesota. Unlike traditional wargames focused solely on military tactics, Braunstein introduced players to roles such as university chancellors and student revolutionaries, emphasizing individual character actions and open-ended narratives. This innovative approach laid the groundwork for modern role-playing games. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Building upon this foundation, Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax collaborated to create \"Dungeons & Dragons\" (D&D), first published in 1974. D&D combined fantasy storytelling with strategic gameplay, allowing players to assume unique character roles within a structured rule system. Its release marked the commercial birth of RPGs, fostering a dedicated following and inspiring numerous other games\n",

    "### The Old School Renaissance (OSR) Movement\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 2000s, the RPG community witnessed the emergence of the Old School Renaissance (OSR). This movement sought to revive the gameplay styles and design philosophies of early RPGs, particularly the original editions of D&D. OSR enthusiasts emphasized simplicity, creativity, and a do-it-yourself (DIY) ethos, often favoring \"rulings over rules\" to grant game masters greater flexibility and players a heightened sense of adventure. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The OSR led to the development of \"retro-clones,\" games that emulate the mechanics and feel of early RPGs. Notable examples include \"Labyrinth Lord\" (2007),\"Swords & Wizardry\" (2008), and \"Old School Essentials\" (2019). These games allowed new generations to experience classic RPG gameplay and encouraged the creation of original content within established frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Growth of the RPG Community and Industry\n",
    "\n",
    "From a financial perspective, the RPG industry has experienced significant growth since its inception. While exact monetary figures are challenging to pinpoint due to the diverse and fragmented nature of the market, several indicators highlight this expansion. According to \"Wizards of the Coast (WotC)\" which has been a part of Hasbro since 1999, \"has experienced a decade of growth that saw their annual profits grow 400%. The company doubled in size in the five years between 2012 to 2017, and Hasbro’s CEO Brian Goldner said today that Wizards was on track to double once again in the following five year period from 2018 to 2023.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2000s introduced the Open Game License (OGL), allowing third-party publishers to create compatible content for D&D. This initiative spurred a proliferation of supplementary materials and alternative RPG systems, diversifying the market and contributing to its financial growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the advent of crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter has further fueled the industry's expansion. Projects such as \"Shadowdark: The Western Reaches\" have raised substantial funds, with this particular campaign garnering over $1.5 million. These successes underscore the community's enthusiasm and the financial viability of innovative RPG endeavors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the rise of actual-play web/podcast/streaming series like \"Critical Role\", \"The Adventure Zone\", and \"Dimension 20\" has introduced RPGs to broader audiences, leading to increased sales of core rulebooks and related merchandise. By 2021, D&D had attracted approximately 85 million global fans, engaging through both tabletop and digital formats. \n",

This also allows us to see what we are getting in our returns so we can iterate our search terms intelligently. \n",

    "* Then we convert the dictionary to a dataframe and save it as a csv by the number range of data pulled in.\n",
